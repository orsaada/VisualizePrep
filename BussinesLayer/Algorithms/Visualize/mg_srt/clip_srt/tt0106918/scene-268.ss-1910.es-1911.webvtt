00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.418
We have here the working steam engine
off the US Army Corps of Engineers

00:00:01.503 --> 00:00:03.420
snag boat, the Arkansas II.

00:00:03.505 --> 00:00:04.922
Now a steam engine works

00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:08.592
by lighting a fire underneath the boilers
where the water is contained.

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:10.969
This heats the water
and turns it into steam.

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:14.056
Because the kids wanted me
to bring them by.
