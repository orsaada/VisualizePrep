So, although I wish I were here
with better news,

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:06.046
the fact is that
you and I are sitting here today

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:10.717
because this will be your last week
of employment at this company.

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:12.970
- Why me?
- What am I supposed to do now?

00:00:13.054 --> 00:00:16.098
Am I supposed to feel better
that I'm not the only one losing my job?

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.933
This is ridiculous!
