When I run my card, the system
automatically prompts the desk clerk

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.584
to greet me with this exact statement.

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:05.212
Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:06.630
It's these kinds of systemized,

00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:09.717
friendly touches
that keep my world in orbit.
