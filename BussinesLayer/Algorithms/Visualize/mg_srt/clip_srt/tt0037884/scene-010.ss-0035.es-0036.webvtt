00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:01.925
What if he goes out
and buys another bottle?

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.136
He hasn't a nickel.
There isn't a store or a bar...

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:06.180
that'll give him
five cents' worth of credit.

00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:08.182
Are you sure he doesn't have
another bottle hidden?

00:00:08.223 --> 00:00:11.143
I went over the apartment
with a fine-tooth comb.

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:12.603
The places he can figure out.
