00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.943
I went out and
printed up 110 copies.

00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:06.801
Even the cover looked like
the "Catcher in the Rye".

00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:11.702
I entitled it, "The Things
We Think and Do Not Say".

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.622
"The Future of Our Business"

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.983
That's how you become great, man.
Hang your balls out there.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.111
Thanks.
