I told myself if he shows up,
we stick with him.

00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:05.019
- Hey, Jerry. How's it going?
- Hey, Cush.

00:00:05.228 --> 00:00:09.920
- How are you?
- You remember Keith.

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:14.821
He must go number one in the draft,
and I want him to play.

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:18.471
It'll either be Denver or San Diego.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.727
- I'll either surf or ski.
- Denver's where he should be.
