WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.374
So we're not so different after all.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.752
I wish that were true.

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.594
So is it a machine
or a living thing?

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:13.722
- It's both, or neither.
- What do you mean, neither?

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:16.266
It seems to be some sort
of silicon-based hybrid.
