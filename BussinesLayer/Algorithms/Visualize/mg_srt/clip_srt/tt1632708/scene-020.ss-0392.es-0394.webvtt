All I'm saying is, it wasn't
so much the pilot's skill

00:00:00.251 --> 00:00:03.221
that landed that plane on the river as

00:00:03.295 --> 00:00:05.718
Are you saying that Captain

00:00:05.798 --> 00:00:07.095
No, no.

00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:08.930
There were just other factors.

00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:10.936
Are you not an American?
