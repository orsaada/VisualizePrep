Thank you.

00:00:03.927 --> 00:00:06.305
All right, gentlemen.
You heard the man. Please wait outside.

00:00:08.765 --> 00:00:12.102
You too, Phil.

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:16.315
- What do you mean?
- I mean I would like
to speak to Mr Morse alone.

00:00:18.192 --> 00:00:20.402
Why does he get to stay?

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:22.863
Please. Please.

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:29.786
- I'll be right outside.
- Good.
