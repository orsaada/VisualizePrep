1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,000

2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:16,800
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

4
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,319
It's gettin' cold.

5
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,960
That is one fine frame.

6
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,120
One fine frame that is.

7
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,719
- How much...

8
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,079
Does a fine frame like that
cost, do you think?

9
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,160
I never told you, but you sound a little
like Dr. Seuss when you're drunk.

10
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,399
I know.
I'm serious.

11
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:30,959
Serious, I am.

12
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,959
I'd say it cost at least
a couple hundred.

13
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,360
- I'm gonna read it for you.
- Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?

14
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,439
"In recognition of his
outstanding achievement..."

15
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
- "in the field of child psychology",
- Mm-hmm.

16
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,840
"his dedication to his work
and his continuing efforts to
improve the quality of life..."

17
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,240
- Will you concentrate?

18
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,439
"...his continuing efforts to
improve the quality of life...

19
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,279
for countless children
and their families,

20
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,240
the city of Philadelphia
proudly bestows upon its son..."

21
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,920
"Dr. Malcolm Crowe..."
That's you...

22
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,439
"...the Mayor's Citation
for professional excellence."

23
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,399
They called you their son.

24
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,079
Wow.

25
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,199
We should hang it
in the bathroom.

26
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,360
This is an important
night for us.

27
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,519
Finally, someone is recognizing
the sacrifices you've made...

28
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,000
that you have put everything
second, including me,

29
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,639
for those families that
they're talking about.

30
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,199
They're also saying that
my husband has a gift.

31
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,959
You have a gift
that teaches children...

32
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,519
- how to be strong in situations...

33
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,279
Where most adults
would piss on themselves.

34
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,519
I believe
what they wrote is real.

35
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,519
Thank you.

36
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,959
- I would like some wine in a glass.
- Mm-hmm.

37
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,879
I would not like it
in a mug.

38
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,040
- I would not like it in a jug.

39
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,000
Look.

40
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:21,920
Anna, don't move.
Don't make a sound.

41
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,240
This is 47 Locus Street.

42
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,240
You've broken a window
and entered a private residence.

43
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,879
You don't know so many things.

44
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:42,079
There are no needles or prescription
drugs of any kind in this house.

45
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:52,040
Do you know why you're afraid
when you're alone?

46
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,279
I do.
I do.

47
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,519
What do you want?

48
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,240
What he promised me!
I want what he promised me.

49
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,600
- Oh, my God.
- Do I know you?

50
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,120
Don't you know me, hero?

51
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,839
Don't you even remember
your own patients?

52
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,199
Downtown clinic.

53
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,839
Single-parent family.

54
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:24,360
Possible mood disorder.

55
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
I was afraid!

56
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,600
You told me I was having trouble
coping with my parents'divorce.

57
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,000
You were wrong.
You were wrong.

58
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,360
Now look at me!

59
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,679
- I don't want to be afraid no more.
- Just give me a minute to think.

60
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,840
I waited
ten years for you!

61
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,759
I'm not giving you nothin'!

62
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,480
Ben Friedkin?

63
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Some people,
they call me "freak".

64
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,840
Ryan Sumner?

65
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,480
I am. I am a freak.
Look at...

66
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,919
Vincent.

67
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,480
Vincent Gray.

68
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,600
No, you don't.

69
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,000
I do remember you.

70
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,519
Quiet, very smart.

71
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:20,039
Compassionate.

72
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,120
Unusually compassionate.

73
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,159
You forgot cursed.

74
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,240
You failed me.

75
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,720
You failed me!

76
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:41,279
Vincent, I'm sorry if I wasn't...
if I didn't help you.

77
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,080
But if you just let me try,

78
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,840
if you just
give me a chance...

79
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,559
Oh, God! Oh, God!

80
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,039
- Did Vincent...
- Don't talk. Shh.

81
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,000
It's okay, Cole.

82
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,360
My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.

83
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,039
We were supposed to meet today,
but I missed our appointment.

84
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,600
I'm sorry.

85
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,200
You know, in the olden days in Europe,
people used to hide out in churches.

86
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,080
They would claim sanctuary.

87
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:58,840
What were they hiding from?

88
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,919
Bad people, mostly.

89
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:08,879
People that wanted to
put them in jail, hurt them.

90
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,320
I noticed your eyeglasses.
They don't have any lenses in them.

91
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,519
They're my dad's.

92
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,519
The lenses hurt my eyes.

93
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,679
What were you talking about with your
soldiers when I came in? Day...

94
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,480
De profundus clamo
adite domine.

95
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,039
It's called "Latin".

96
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,039
- All your soldiers speak Latin?
- No.

97
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,600
Just one.

98
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,240
Are you a good doctor?

99
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,679
Well,

100
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,840
I used to be.

101
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,879
I won an award once
from the mayor.

102
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,679
It had an expensive frame.

103
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,600
I'm gonna see you again,
right?

104
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,879
If that's okay with you.

105
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,200
It's me.

106
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,360
The turnpike westbound
slows at Valley Forge 24.

107
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,120
On the Blue Ridge,
both directions generally slow
between number three and two...

108
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,759
Hey, good morning.

109
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,799
Cole.

110
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,279
Cole!

111
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,480
Hey, your Cocoa Puffs
are gettin' soggy.

112
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,880
Let me see you.
Oh, honey, you got a spot.

113
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,400
Head up.

114
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
- Okay, here we go.

115
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,599
Something you were
looking for, baby?

116
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,240
Pop Tarts?

117
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,720
They're right here.

118
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,240
Oh.

119
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,400
Well, what are you
thinking, Mama?

120
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Lots of things.

121
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,799
Anything bad about me?

122
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,680
Hey, look at my face.

123
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,440
I was not thinking
something bad about you.

124
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,960
Got it?

125
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,000
Got it.

126
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,720
- Here, head up.

127
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,880
- That's Tommy.
- That's okay. You tuck it in.

128
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,960
Cole, you want this?

129
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,759
Hey, freak, how'd you like that
"arm around the shoulder" bit?

130
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,359
I just made that up.
I went with it.

131
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,519
It's what great actors do.
It's called "improv".

132
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,359
Hey, baby.

133
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,880
How was your day?

134
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,000
Hmm?

135
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,359
You know, you can tell me things
if you need to.

136
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:55,960
Well, you know
what I did today?

137
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,920
I, uh, I won the Pennsylvania Lottery
in the morning,

138
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,799
I quit my jobs,

139
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,680
and I ate a big picnic in the park
with lots of chocolate mousse pie.

140
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,960
And then I swam
in the fountain all afternoon.

141
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,519
What'd you do?

142
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,400
I was picked first for
kick ball teams at recess.

143
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,319
I hit a grand slam
to win the game.

144
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:28,920
Everybody lifted me up
on their shoulders
and carried me around, cheering.

145
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,880
Well, in that case, I am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

146
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:39,440
You got an hour.

147
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,160
Hi.

148
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:53,240
Wanna sit?

149
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,799
Don't feel like
talking today?

150
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,279
Wanna play a game?

151
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,480
It's a mind-reading game.

152
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,480
Here's how it works.

153
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,880
I read your mind.

154
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,119
If what I say is right, you take
one step towards the chair.

155
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,079
If what I say is wrong,
you take one step back...

156
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,000
towards the doorway.

157
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,480
If you reach the chair,
you sit down.

158
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,839
If you reach the door,
you can go.

159
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,200
Wanna play?

160
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,000
Okay.

161
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,720
When your mother and father
were first divorced,

162
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,920
your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't help her.

163
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,599
So you think I'm not going
to be able to help you.

164
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:25,839
You're worried that she said
she told him things...

165
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,359
things she couldn't tell
anyone else.

166
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,880
Secrets.

167
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,039
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

168
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,799
Your dad gave you that watch
as a present just before he went away.

169
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,000
He forgot it in a drawer.

170
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,519
Doesn't work.

171
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,759
You keep pretty quiet
in school, but...

172
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,079
you're a good student, you've never
really been in any serious trouble.

173
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,319
We were supposed
to draw a picture.

174
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,079
Anything we wanted.

175
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,160
I drew a man.

176
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,680
He got hurt in the neck by
another man with a screwdriver.

177
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,759
You saw that on TV, Cole?

178
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,880
Everyone got upset.

179
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:06,640
They had a meeting.

180
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,559
Mom started crying.

181
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,640
I don't draw
like that anymore.

182
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,680
How do you draw now?

183
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,480
I draw... people smiling,

184
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,759
dogs running,

185
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,799
rainbows.

186
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,839
They don't have meetings
about rainbows.

187
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,640
No. I guess they don't.

188
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,039
What am I thinking now?

189
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,119
I don't know
what you're thinking now.

190
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,359
I was thinking...

191
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:59,880
you're nice,

192
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:04,279
but you can't help me.

193
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:23,599
I thought you meant the other Italian
restaurant I asked you to marry me in.

194
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm so sorry, Anna.

195
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,240
I just can't seem
to keep track of time.

196
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,720
And I didn't have
a very good session today.

197
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,039
They're both so similar.

198
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,960
The same mannerisms, same expressions,
same things hanging over their head.

199
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:57,920
I think it might be
some kind of abuse.

200
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,319
Cole has...
scratches on his arm.

201
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,920
I think they might be
fingernail cuts.

202
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,839
Defensive cuts, maybe.
I don't know.

203
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:10,960
Maybe a teacher or a neighbor.

204
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,200
I don't think it's the mother.
I've seen her with him,
and it doesn't seem to fit.

205
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,759
Or I could just be wrong.

206
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,400
Maybe he's just a kid
who likes to climb trees a lot.

207
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:35,240
Anna.

208
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,160
I know that I've been
a little distant, all right?

209
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,319
I know that it makes you mad.
I just...

210
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:46,240
feel like I'm being given
a second chance, and
I don't want it to slip away.

211
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,000
- Anna.

212
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,799
Happy anniversary.

213
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,440
Stop looking at me.

214
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,279
I don't like when people
look at me like that.

215
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,799
- Okay.

216
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,720
I walk this way to school
with Tommy Tammisimo.

217
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,640
Is he your best buddy?

218
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,559
He hates me.

219
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,960
Do you hate him?

220
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,599
No.

221
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,599
Did your mom
set that up?

222
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:28,119
Yes.

223
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,680
Did you ever talk to your mom
about how things are with Tommy?

224
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,759
- I don't tell her things.
- Why not?

225
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,400
'Cause she doesn't look at me like
everybody else, and I don't want her to.

226
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,079
- I don't want her to know.
- Know what?

227
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,480
That I'm a freak.

228
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,599
Hey.

229
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,480
You are not a freak.
Okay?

230
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,160
Don't you believe anybody that tries to
convince you of that. That's bullshit.

231
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,119
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

232
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,640
Okay?

233
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:03,799
Come on.

234
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,200
- You said the "S" word.
- Yeah, I know.

235
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,759
Sorry.

236
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,880
So your dad lives
in Pittsburgh with a lady...

237
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:21,759
that works in a toll booth?

238
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,400
I wonder if she has to pee
when she's working.

239
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,440
Think she just holds it?

240
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,279
I don't know. I was just
thinking about that myself.

241
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,279
You asked a lot of questions
about Dad today.

242
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,519
How come?

243
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:40,200
Well, sometimes we do things
to draw attention,

244
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,200
to express our feelings
about certain issues...

245
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,519
divorce, whatever.

246
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:53,759
For example, a person might
leave something on the desk
for someone else to find.

247
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,079
Do you know what free
association writing is, Cole?

248
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:02,160
No.

249
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,319
Free association writing
is when you take a pencil in your hand,

250
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,559
and you put the pencil to a piece
of paper and you start writing.

251
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:14,200
And you don't look
at what you're writing or
think about what you're writing.

252
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,519
You just keep
your hand moving.

253
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,440
And after a while, if you keep
your hand moving long enough,

254
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,759
words and thoughts start coming out that
you didn't even know you had in you.

255
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,119
It could be something
you heard somewhere else,

256
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:35,000
or feelings you had
deep inside of you.

257
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,960
Have you ever done any
free association writing, Cole?

258
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,880
Yes.

259
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,519
What did you write?

260
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:51,880
Upset words.

261
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,559
Did you ever write any upset words
before your father left?

262
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,079
I don't remember.

263
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:04,039
Can you do something for me?

264
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,359
I want you to think about what you
wanna get out of our time together...

265
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:11,319
what our goal should be.

266
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:14,960
Something I want?

267
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,640
If you could change something
in your life, anything at all,

268
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,559
what would it be?

269
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:24,400
Instead of something I want,
can it be something I don't want?

270
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:27,279
Okay.

271
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,319
I don't want to be
scared anymore.

272
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,079
You gonna get that?

273
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,759
Are you gonna get that?

274
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,680
- Hi.
- Hi.

275
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,240
- Don't you see enough of me
at the store?
- Yeah, I'm on my way out...

276
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,160
to the flea market
in the Amish country.

277
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,079
I thought maybe you'd
wanna come along...

278
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,799
and show me how to buy
at one of these things.

279
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,519
I don't know if I can deal
with the Amish today.

280
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:14,039
You can't curse or spit
or anything around them.

281
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,880
I just figured maybe you'd just want to
get out and get some air,

282
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,480
because you've seemed
kind of down lately.

283
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,640
Um, I'm okay.

284
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,599
Do you think that maybe I should stop by
on the way back, show you what I got?

285
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,880
Because that
wouldn't be a problem.

286
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:33,240
No, I... You know,
I can see on Monday.

287
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,240
Sure, yeah, that's fine.
I'm just...

288
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,759
Okay, so I guess I'm gonna get going
then. I'll speak to you later.

289
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,200
- Don't step in the horse manure.
- Thank you very much.

290
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,200
Keep moving, cheese dick.

291
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:22,000
Can anybody guess what city was capital
of the United States of America...

292
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,799
from 1790 to 1800?

293
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,480
I'll give you a hint:
It's the city you live in.

294
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,359
- Philadelphia!
- Right, right.

295
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,880
Philadelphia's one of the oldest cities
in this country.

296
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,200
A lot of generations
have lived here and died here.

297
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,680
Almost any place you go in this city
has a history and a story behind it.

298
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,680
Even this school
and the grounds it sits on.

299
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,160
Can anyone guess what this building
was used for a hundred years ago...

300
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,559
before you went to school here,
before I went to this school even?

301
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:06,640
Yes, Cole.

302
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,880
They used to hang people here.

303
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,320
No, uh, that... Mm-mm. That's
not correct. Where'd you hear that?

304
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:22,280
They pulled the people in, crying
and kissing their families bye.

305
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:27,679
People watching...
spit at them.

306
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,000
Uh, Cole, this building
was a legal courthouse.

307
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,320
Laws were passed here... some of
the very first laws of this country.

308
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,519
This whole building
was full of, uh, lawyers,

309
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,280
- lawmakers.
- They were the ones
that hanged everybody.

310
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,679
Uh...

311
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,360
I don't know which one
of these guys told you that,

312
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,000
but, uh, they were
just trying to scare you.

313
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,000
I don't like people
looking at me like that.

314
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,920
Like what?

315
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:08,000
Stop it!

316
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,679
I, uh, I-I-I don't know
how else to look.

317
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,199
You're Stuttering Stanley!

318
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,119
- Excuse me?
- You talked funny when
you went to school here.

319
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,840
You talked funny
all the way to high school.

320
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,840
- What?
- You shouldn't look at people.
It makes them feel bad.

321
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:29,719
- How did you...
- Stop looking at me!

322
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,719
Who have you...
been speaking to?

323
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,239
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

324
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,440
- Stop it. St-St-St...
- Stuttering Stanley!

325
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,119
- Stop that!
- Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

326
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,079
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

327
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,000
Shut up, you f-f-freak!

328
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,280
Hey, big guy.

329
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,960
How's it goin'?

330
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:13,360
I don't wanna talk about
anything right now.

331
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,920
Okay.

332
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:31,960
You like magic?

333
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:35,480
Hmm?

334
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,719
Observe:
The magic penny.

335
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,920
Looks like
an ordinary penny.

336
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,000
But I do my little
magic shake, and...

337
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,760
now it's in my right hand.

338
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,320
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

339
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,360
I do another
little shake, and...

340
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,480
right there
in the vest pocket.

341
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,639
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

342
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,159
I do another little shake...

343
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,679
and...

344
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,079
right back in the left hand
where it started.

345
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,960
That isn't magic.

346
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:19,679
What are you talking about?
Of course it's magic.

347
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,840
You just kept the penny
in that hand the whole time.

348
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,280
Think so?

349
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,679
I didn't know you were funny.

350
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:50,840
Malcolm, sit your cute
butt down and listen up.

351
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,039
No doubt about it.
Anna is like my sister.

352
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,039
And you better make her happy.
I'm not talkin' about no...

353
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,440
"Mmm, this taste like
real butter" kind of happy.

354
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:03,360
I'm talkin' about...
What's up, girl?

355
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,920
"Julie Andrews
twirling around like...

356
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,280
a mental patient on a mountaintop"
kind of happy.

357
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,440
That's the kind of happy
I'm talkin'about.

358
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:13,400
Shh. Come here.

359
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,880
Don't tell her I told you,

360
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:19,239
but she said
she knew she love you...

361
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,199
from the first time
she met you on the street.

362
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,400
She'd do anything for you.

363
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,920
I love you guys.

364
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,639
My nose is running.
Turn it...

365
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,360
And then you do
the magic shake.

366
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,719
The penny has moved
from my pocket...

367
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,519
all the way back
to the hand it started in.

368
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,079
That's stupid.

369
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,880
It's supposed
to be funny.

370
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,800
It's stupid.
I want my penny back.

371
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,000
He doesn't get
invited places, so it's our pleasure.

372
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,400
Last time was a Chuck E. Cheese
party a year ago.

373
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:23,480
He hid in one of those purple plastic
tunnels and didn't come out.

374
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:26,440
- Chucky who?
- Cheese. It's a kids place.

375
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:30,920
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

376
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:05,480
Is someone out there?

377
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,840
Open this door, please.
Come on.

378
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,639
I can't breathe.
If you can hear me, open this door.

379
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,679
I swear on my life I didn't
take the master's horse.

380
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,320
Open this door, or I'll
break through it and grab you!

381
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,679
- The star of the commercial
always gets his own trailer.
- For what?

382
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,719
He needs a place to think
about his character, alone.

383
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,639
- You only had one line.

384
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:34,559
Derrick, check it out.

385
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Oh, yeah.

386
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:40,639
My dad
made me invite him.

387
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,119
Happy birthday, Derrick.

388
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,320
Is there somethin'
you want to see in there?

389
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:05,239
No.

390
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,639
We're gonna put on
a pretend play.

391
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,679
- Wanna be in it?
- Okay.

392
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,159
It's called
"Locked in the Dungeon".

393
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,039
Yes, Cole, and, uh, you get to be
the one locked in the dungeon.

394
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:25,119
Don't! Don't!
Don't! Don't!

395
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,639
Don't!

396
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,599
Let me out! No! No!

397
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,480
No! No!

398
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:57,840
- Cole?

399
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:01,679
- Cole!

400
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,559
Is there a key
for this door?

401
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,960
Cole? Honey?
Honey, can you hear me?

402
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,400
Oh, my God! Cole!

403
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:19,400
Help me! Help!
Help! Help!

404
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,719
The tests would indicate
he did not have a seizure.

405
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,119
He's doing fine.

406
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,199
After some rest,
he can go home tonight.

407
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,920
There's some cuts and
bruises on your son...

408
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:50,480
- that are concerning me.
- Oh, man.

409
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,360
Yeah, those are from sports.

410
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,079
You think I hurt my child?

411
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,920
You think I'm a bad mother?

412
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:08,960
Mrs. Sloan over there,

413
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:11,519
she's a social worker
with the hospital.

414
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,239
She's gonna ask you a couple
procedural questions.

415
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,800
What happened
to my child today?

416
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:24,599
Something was happening to him,
physically happening.
Something was very wrong!

417
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,639
Hey.

418
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:43,840
Did your father used to
tell you bedtime stories?

419
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:55,360
Once upon a time
there was this young prince,

420
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,920
and he decided that
he wanted to go for a drive.

421
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,880
He got his driver,
and they started driving.

422
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,840
Driving, driving.

423
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,320
Driving a lot.

424
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:12,880
And, uh,

425
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,440
they drove so much
that he fell asleep.

426
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:19,960
And...

427
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,239
Then he woke up, and he realized
they were still driving.

428
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,119
- This was a very long trip.
- Dr. Crowe?

429
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:31,840
You haven't told
bedtime stories before.

430
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,039
Uh, not too many, no.

431
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,119
You have to add
some twists and stuff.

432
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,880
Okay. Some twists.

433
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,599
Like what kind of twists?
Give me an example.

434
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,119
- Maybe they run out of gas.
- They run out of gas?

435
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,159
That's good, 'cause they're driving,
right? Okay, so...

436
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,079
Tell me the story
about why you're sad.

437
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:01,800
You think I'm sad?

438
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:06,519
What makes you think that?

439
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:10,559
Your eyes told me.

440
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,719
Not supposed to talk
about stuff like that.

441
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,079
Once upon a time, there was
this person named Malcolm.

442
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,199
He worked with children.

443
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,559
He loved it.

444
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,079
He loved it
more than anything else.

445
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:40,760
And then one night,
he found out that...

446
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,840
he made a mistake
with one of them.

447
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,039
He couldn't help that one.

448
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:50,440
And he can't stop
thinking about it.

449
00:46:50,679 --> 00:46:54,320
He can't forget.

450
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,559
Ever since then,
things have been different.

451
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,159
He's not the same person
that he used to be.

452
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,440
And his wife...

453
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:10,039
doesn't like the person
that he's become.

454
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,199
They barely speak anymore.
They're like strangers.

455
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:19,480
And then one day, Malcolm meets
this wonderful little boy.

456
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:23,079
A really cool little boy.

457
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,239
Reminds him a lot
of the other one.

458
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:32,800
And Malcolm decides
to try and help this new boy...

459
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,559
'cause he feels that
if he can help this new boy,

460
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:43,760
it will be like...
helping that other one too.

461
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:48,719
How does the story end?

462
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:52,360
I don't know.

463
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,960
I wanna tell you
my secret now.

464
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:18,320
Okay.

465
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,519
I see dead people.

466
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:31,880
In your dreams?

467
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:35,920
While you're awake?

468
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,360
Dead people, like,
in graves, in coffins?

469
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,519
Walking around
like regular people.

470
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,000
They don't see each other.

471
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:53,840
They only see
what they wanna see.

472
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,400
They don't know they're dead.

473
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,079
How often do you see them?

474
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,760
All the time.

475
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:12,119
They're everywhere.

476
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,159
You won't tell anyone
my secret, right?

477
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,159
No. I promise.

478
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,920
Will you stay here
until I fall asleep?

479
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:29,280
Of course.

480
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:43,719
Cole has pathologies
more severe than initially assessed.

481
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,480
He's suffering from
visual hallucinations,

482
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:49,199
- paranoia,

483
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,840
some kind of...
school-age schizophrenia.

484
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,039
Medication, hospitalization
may be required.

485
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,400
And I'm not helping him.

486
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,800
Hi, this is Lynn Sear,
Cole's mom.

487
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,280
Yeah, uh, I...
I'd like to talk to you...

488
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:43,639
about your boy and his friends keeping
their goddamn hands off my son.

489
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:18,039
Mama?

490
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,639
No, dinner
is not ready!

491
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,239
What are you
gonna do?

492
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,360
You can't hurt me
anymore!

493
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,880
Neddy! You're a terrible
husband, Neddy!

494
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:35,119
Look what you made me do!
Neddy!

495
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,400
Once there was a boy,

496
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:56,880
very different
from all the other boys.

497
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,719
He lived in the jungle,

498
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,840
and he could speak
to the animals.

499
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:20,119
Did you think the play
sucked big time?

500
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,280
What?

501
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:26,639
Tommy Tammisimo acted
in a cough syrup commercial.

502
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,400
He said everyone was self-conscious
and unrealistic.

503
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:31,400
He said the play
sucked big time.

504
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:35,719
This Tommy kid sounds
like a real punk.

505
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:39,639
I thought the play was excellent.
Better than "Cats".

506
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,719
- "Cats"?
- Never mind.

507
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,760
Cole, I was really interested
in what you told me at the hospital.

508
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,920
I'd like to hear
more about it.

509
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:03,960
Cole?

510
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,599
What?

511
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,559
Is something
up there?

512
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:29,760
Cole,

513
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:34,719
I don't
see anything.

514
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:41,480
Be real still.

515
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,280
Sometimes you
feel it inside,

516
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:48,079
like you're falling down
real fast,

517
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,639
but you're really
just standing still.

518
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:59,480
You ever feel the prickly things
on the back of your neck?

519
00:55:59,719 --> 00:56:02,360
Yes.

520
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:06,119
And the tiny hairs on your arm,
you know, when they stand up?

521
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,320
Yes.

522
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,519
That's them.

523
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,280
When they get mad,

524
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,480
it gets cold.

525
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,960
I don't see anything.
Are you sure they're there?

526
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:48,960
Cole?

527
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:51,639
Please make them leave.

528
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,719
I'm workin' on it.

529
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,920
Come on.

530
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:28,320
Aah!

531
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:45,840
Mommy, Daddy?

532
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,280
My throat hurts.

533
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,280
Run! Run!

534
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,000
Pedia Ease
cough suppressant.

535
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:07,760
- Gentle, fast, effect...
- Cole.

536
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,719
I don't care what they say,
this thing is broken.

537
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,679
Take 'em off.

538
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:27,760
I don't want them
on my table.

539
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:33,320
I saw what was in your bureau drawer
when I was cleaning.

540
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:36,880
Got something
you want to confess?

541
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,639
Hmm?
The bumblebee pendant?

542
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,760
Why do you
keep taking it?

543
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,880
It was Grandma's.

544
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:54,639
You know, what if it broke?
You know how sad I'd be.

545
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,039
You'd cry 'cause you
miss Grandma so much.

546
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,119
That's right.

547
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:10,119
Sometimes people think
they lose things,

548
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:13,960
and they really didn't lose them...
it just gets moved.

549
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:17,840
So, did you move
the bumblebee pendant?

550
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,360
Don't get mad.

551
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:28,400
So, who moved it
this time?

552
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,960
Maybe someone came in our house,
took the bumblebee pendant
out of my closet...

553
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:35,360
and placed it nicely
in your drawer.

554
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,679
- Maybe.
- God, I am so tired, Cole.

555
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,119
I'm tired in my body,
I'm tired in my mind,

556
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,079
I'm... tired
in my heart.

557
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,159
I need some help.

558
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,280
You know, I don't know if you
noticed, but our little family
isn't doing so good.

559
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:52,199
I mean,
I've been praying,

560
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,280
but I must not
be praying right.

561
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:59,679
Looks like we're just gonna have to
answer each other's prayers.

562
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:05,840
If we can't talk to each other,
we're not gonna make it.

563
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:11,400
Now, tell me, baby.
I-I-I won't get mad, honey.

564
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:15,599
Did you take
the bumblebee pendant?

565
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:26,079
- No.

566
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:30,400
You've had enough roast beef.
You need to leave the table.

567
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,000
Go!

568
01:00:55,519 --> 01:01:01,800
Hey, come on. I'll show you where
my dad keeps his gun. Come on.

569
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,599
Sebastian, come on!

570
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:14,199
- Mama?

571
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,400
If you're not
very mad,

572
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:23,599
can I sleep
in your bed tonight?

573
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,199
Look at my face.

574
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,679
I'm not very mad.

575
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:36,599
- Baby, why are you shaking?

576
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,840
Cole, what's wrong?

577
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:42,559
Oh, God,
please tell me!

578
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:47,000
Oh, please.

579
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:51,159
Oh.

580
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,079
It's Edwardian,
beautifully worked...

581
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:06,000
with mine-cut diamonds
and an actual color Burmese sapphire.

582
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:08,639
It's timeless.

583
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,000
- Oh.

584
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:13,400
You, uh...

585
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:16,119
Got anything
a little plainer?

586
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:20,760
Plainer? You want a plain ring
to go with your plain fiance?
Is that how it is?

587
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,159
No! Baby,
don't get in a tissy.

588
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:31,159
Uh...
You're so beautiful.

589
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,800
You're like a Burmese sapphire
all by yourself.

590
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,599
- You don't need all that.
- Uh-huh.

591
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,039
Why don't you
try it on...

592
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:43,880
and see how you both
feel about it.

593
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,679
There. How does
that feel?

594
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,880
I think this piece,
um, communicates a longing.

595
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,880
I imagine that the woman
who owned it...

596
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:02,239
Ioved a man that she
couldn't be with.

597
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,360
Did he have wavy hair
and chestnut eyes?

598
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,360
- Huh?
- Um, I don't know, but...

599
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,239
a lot of the pieces
in this store communicate,

600
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,239
and I think you should choose
a piece that speaks to you.

601
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:21,639
I think maybe when people own things
and then they pass away,

602
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:25,039
a part of themselves gets
printed on those things,

603
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:30,320
like...
like fingerprints.

604
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,280
I'll just
wrap it up.

605
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,480
You don't need a guy
with a Master's.

606
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:44,199
You need a wrestler with a neck
larger than his head.

607
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:48,360
No, I need a wrestler with a Master's.

608
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:50,840
- What's this?
- Happy birthday.

609
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:54,800
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

610
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:04,320
It's a...
first edition.

611
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,800
- Wow.

612
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:09,599
- You know, this is too much.
- No.

613
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,559
Took it out of
your Christmas bonus.

614
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,719
It's perfect, Anna.

615
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,800
- Thanks.

616
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:26,239
What do you want
more than anything?

617
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,440
I don't know.

618
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:32,840
- I've told you what I want.

619
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,280
I know what I want.

620
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,039
I want to be able to
talk to my wife again.

621
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,840
The way we used to
talk to each other.

622
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,039
Like there was no one else
in the world except us.

623
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:53,960
How are you gonna do that?

624
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,639
Can't be your doctor
anymore.

625
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:04,079
I haven't paid enough
attention to my family.

626
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,800
Bad things happen
when you do that.

627
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:10,159
Do you understand?

628
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:15,599
- I'm going to transfer you.
I know two psychologists.
- Don't fail me.

629
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:20,519
Don't give up. You're the only one
who can help me, I know it.

630
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:24,320
- I can't help you.

631
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,239
You...

632
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,840
Someone else
can help you.

633
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:37,400
You believe me, right?

634
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:43,119
Dr. Crowe, you believe
my secret, right?

635
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,920
I don't know how
to answer that, Cole.

636
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,880
How can you help me...

637
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,199
if you don't believe me?

638
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,719
Some magic's real.

639
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,559
Do you know why you're
afraid when you're alone?

640
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:33,000
I do.
I do.

641
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:42,280
I'm sorry, Vincent. I hope I
didn't leave you alone too long.

642
01:06:42,519 --> 01:06:47,000
Whew.
It's cold in here.

643
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:52,880
Vincent,
why are you crying?

644
01:06:55,320 --> 01:07:00,000
You won't believe.

645
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:07,480
Sorry, Vincent. I hope
I didn't leave you alone too long.

646
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:12,159
Whew.
It's cold in here.

647
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,079
- Vincent...

648
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:21,840
Whew.
It's cold in here.

649
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:28,880
- Nah, you know what?
I never liked him either.

650
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,360
When I was a kid,
I had this blood test done,

651
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:36,880
- and I threw up chili cheese
fries all over this male nurse.

652
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,599
Excuse me.
Dr. Reed is on line two.

653
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,320
Vincent, will you
excuse me? I have to take this.

654
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,199
- Just give me a minute, okay?
- Okay.

655
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,840
No entiendes.

656
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:03,039
Yo no quiero morir.

657
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,159
Yo no quiero morir.

658
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:14,640
- Oh, my God.
- Yo no quiero morir!

659
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:24,000
You been
running around?

660
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,000
Make you
feel better?

661
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:32,159
I like to run around.
It's good exercise.

662
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:37,760
Do you want to ask me
questions now?

663
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:41,720
Want to be a lance corporal in Company "M",
Third Battalion, Seventh Marines?

664
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,720
We're being dispatched
into the Quang Nam province.

665
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,760
Maybe later.

666
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:52,840
Something happened,
didn't it?

667
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:58,359
You wigging out?

668
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:02,800
Yes.
I think I am.

669
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,960
Do you know what
"Yo no quiero morir" means?

670
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:11,880
It's Spanish.
It means "I don't want to die."

671
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,920
What do you think these ghosts want
when they talk to you?

672
01:10:23,239 --> 01:10:26,800
I want you to
think about it, Cole.

673
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,000
I want you to think about it
really carefully.

674
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:34,319
What do you think
they want?

675
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:40,439
- Just help.
- That's right. That's what I think too.

676
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,880
They just want help,
even the scary ones.

677
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:45,960
I think I might know a way
to make them go away.

678
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:48,840
How?

679
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:52,479
Listen to them.

680
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,840
What if they
don't want help?

681
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:58,119
What if they're just angry and they
just want to hurt somebody?

682
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:00,439
I don't think
that's the way it works.

683
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:04,319
How do you know
for sure?

684
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,680
I don't.

685
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,560
- Hey!

686
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,079
- Hey! Hey!

687
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:51,159
What's happening?

688
01:11:51,399 --> 01:11:56,600
What's happening?

689
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:01,399
Go!

690
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:13,720
What's happening
to you?

691
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,920
Is someone hurting you?
I'll kick their ass.

692
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:21,680
Cole, if they're
hurting you...

693
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:36,520
Mama, you sleep now.

694
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:40,720
I'm feeling
much better now.

695
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,880
Do you want to
tell me something?

696
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,680
She came a long way
to visit me, didn't she?

697
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:28,960
I guess she did.

698
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,119
Can you get
some water?

699
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:20,680
That's her sister.

700
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:40,359
You know, when I went through this
with my father's cancer...

701
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,600
I just can't imagine a child
being in bed for two years.

702
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,079
How many...
How many doctors?

703
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:48,960
- I think it was six.
- Six different doctors?

704
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:52,920
I think so, yes.

705
01:16:57,079 --> 01:17:01,239
I just heard the, uh,
little one is falling ill now.

706
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:05,119
God help them.

707
01:17:22,359 --> 01:17:24,640
Don't go home,
okay?

708
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,680
I definitely won't.

709
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:24,199
Aah!

710
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,560
Mister?

711
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,720
Excuse me, mister.

712
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:36,239
Are you
Kyra's daddy?

713
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:50,960
It's for you.

714
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:55,640
Sh-She wanted
to tell you something.

715
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,640
Oh, no, here he comes.
He's coming my way. Psst!

716
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,279
Would you like to dance?

717
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:44,159
Well, actually,
I just came with my friends.

718
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:46,600
Oh, well,
how about this?

719
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,960
We can dance for a little bit,
and if you don't like the way I dance,

720
01:20:50,199 --> 01:20:51,920
you can kick me.

721
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:55,600
Oh, okay then.

722
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:05,880
It's time for lunch, Kyra.

723
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:10,800
- I'm feeling much better now.
- That's so great, honey.

724
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:14,720
It's time for your food.

725
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:17,159
Can I go outside
if I eat this?

726
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,560
I don't know. You know how
you get sick in the afternoons.

727
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,920
We'll see.

728
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:29,199
Don't say that it tastes funny.
You know I don't like to hear that.

729
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:35,840
Tami's mom called.

730
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:52,960
You were
keeping her sick.

731
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:11,760
You liked it,
she said.

732
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,960
She looked out
for you.

733
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:19,840
Is Kyra coming back?

734
01:23:21,399 --> 01:23:25,640
Not anymore.

735
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,000
I think that's enough.
That's enough makeup.

736
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:35,560
Okay.

737
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:40,800
- They're calling for the stable boy.
- We have to hurry!

738
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:46,359
Who, uh...
Who were you talking to?

739
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:55,840
Just practicing
my lines.

740
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:59,920
Thanks for giving me this part,
Mr. Cunningham.

741
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:03,600
You know, when I went to school
here, there was a terrible fire
in this section of the theater.

742
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,600
They rebuilt
the whole thing.

743
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,119
Yeah, I know.

744
01:24:18,439 --> 01:24:23,000
Only he who is pure of heart
can take the sword from the stone.

745
01:24:23,239 --> 01:24:27,159
Let the boy try.

746
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,319
He is a stable boy.
He cleans up after the horses.

747
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:38,039
- Silence, village idiot.

748
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:42,399
Let the boy
step forward.

749
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:11,439
Hail, King Arthur!

750
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:17,880
Yea!

751
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,479
I thought you were
really great in the play, Cole.

752
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,640
- Really?
- Yeah.

753
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,039
- You know what else?
- What?

754
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:54,000
I thought Tommy Tammisimo
sucked big time.

755
01:25:59,439 --> 01:26:02,520
I got an idea how you can talk
to your wife.

756
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,680
Wait till
she's asleep.

757
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:10,800
Then she'll listen to you
and she won't even know it.

758
01:26:16,279 --> 01:26:20,800
I'm not gonna see you
anymore, am I?

759
01:26:21,399 --> 01:26:25,319
I think we said everything
we needed to say.

760
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:29,920
Maybe it's time to say things
to someone closer to you.

761
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:34,800
Maybe we can pretend like we're
gonna see each other tomorrow.

762
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,279
Just for pretend.

763
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,560
Okay.

764
01:26:50,119 --> 01:26:53,960
I'm gonna go now.

765
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:02,079
I'll see you
tomorrow, Cole.

766
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,000
I'm okay, Officer.
I-I'm okay.

767
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:33,880
I don't know
what happened.

768
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,199
Hmm.

769
01:27:40,439 --> 01:27:44,880
Geez, I hope
nobody got hurt.

770
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:49,319
You're very quiet.

771
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:52,560
You're mad I missed
the play, aren't you?

772
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,920
I have two jobs, baby.

773
01:27:55,159 --> 01:27:59,439
You know how important
they are for us.

774
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,760
I'd give anything
to have been there.

775
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:17,399
I'm ready to communicate
with you now.

776
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,399
Communicate?

777
01:28:24,439 --> 01:28:28,159
Tell you my secrets.

778
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:32,039
What is it?

779
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:36,720
You know the accident
up there?

780
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,680
Yeah.

781
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,760
Someone got hurt.

782
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,920
They did?

783
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:47,399
A lady.

784
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:49,640
She died.

785
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:53,399
Oh, my God.
What, you can see her?

786
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:58,039
- Yes.
- Where is she?

787
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,199
Standing next to
my window.

788
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,279
Cole, you're
scaring me.

789
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:16,199
They scare me too
sometimes.

790
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:20,880
They?

791
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:25,479
Ghosts.

792
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:32,079
You see ghosts, Cole?

793
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:36,840
They want me to
do things for them.

794
01:29:38,119 --> 01:29:40,079
They...
They talk to you?

795
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:44,119
They tell you
to do things?

796
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:48,359
They're the ones
that used to hurt me.

797
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,079
What are you
thinking, Mama?

798
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:55,640
- You think I'm a freak?
- Look at my face.

799
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,720
I would never think that
about you. Ever.

800
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:03,760
- Got it?
- Got it.

801
01:30:09,319 --> 01:30:12,760
Just let me think
for a minute.

802
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:18,479
Grandma says hi.

803
01:30:20,359 --> 01:30:23,239
She says she's sorry for
taking the bumblebee pendant.

804
01:30:23,479 --> 01:30:27,479
She just
likes it a lot.

805
01:30:28,359 --> 01:30:33,560
- What?
- Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

806
01:30:34,439 --> 01:30:36,880
Cole, that's
very wrong.

807
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:39,439
- Grandma's gone, you know that.
- I know.

808
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,680
- She wanted me to tell you...
- Cole, please stop.

809
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:47,000
She wanted me to tell you
she saw you dance.

810
01:30:47,159 --> 01:30:50,479
She said
when you were little,

811
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,399
you and her
had a fight...

812
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:56,720
right before
your dance recital.

813
01:30:57,439 --> 01:31:03,399
- You thought she didn't come
to see you dance.

814
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:09,319
She did.

815
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:16,560
She hid in the back
so you wouldn't see.

816
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,920
Sh-She said you were
like an angel.

817
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,800
- She said...

818
01:31:26,039 --> 01:31:30,800
you came to the place
where they buried her,

819
01:31:31,479 --> 01:31:35,279
asked her a question.

820
01:31:36,319 --> 01:31:40,239
She said
the answer is...

821
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:43,800
every day.

822
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,680
What did you ask?

823
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,800
Do...

824
01:31:58,039 --> 01:32:03,039
Do I make her proud?

825
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:07,800
Mama.

826
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,800
Hi, everybody.
As most of you know,

827
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:39,399
I'm not
used to doing this,

828
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,960
and I promised Anna
that I'd try not to embarrass her.

829
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:47,039
I'll leave that to her mother.

830
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:49,199
But we do want to thank
all of you for coming...

831
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:52,000
and for sharing
this wonderful day with us.

832
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:54,800
It's bittersweet almost,
for me,

833
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:57,000
'cause I hate
giving her up.

834
01:32:57,239 --> 01:33:00,760
Anna?

835
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:12,079
I miss you.

836
01:33:16,279 --> 01:33:18,600
I miss you too.

837
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,359
Why, Malcolm?

838
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,680
What?

839
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:29,239
- What is it?
- Why did you leave me?

840
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:34,079
I didn't leave you.

841
01:33:52,439 --> 01:33:55,920
I see people.

842
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:59,960
They don't know
they're dead.

843
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:08,520
- How often
do you see them?
- All the time.

844
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,880
They're everywhere.

845
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:26,199
They only see
what they want to see.

846
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:33,159
Okay, Mikey.

847
01:34:33,399 --> 01:34:37,960
Come on.
Give me a minute.

848
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,079
- Oh, God.

849
01:35:15,319 --> 01:35:20,279
- It doesn't even hurt.
- Let me see.

850
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:24,239
- Let me see. Put your hand...

851
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:28,079
Oh, God.

852
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,239
- Okay.

853
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,439
I think I'm okay.
Really, I think it just went...

854
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:59,359
went in and out.

855
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:05,359
It doesn't even
hurt anymore.

856
01:36:32,039 --> 01:36:35,920
I think
I can go now.

857
01:36:38,039 --> 01:36:41,800
I just needed
to do a couple things.

858
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:49,279
I needed
to help someone.

859
01:36:50,279 --> 01:36:53,880
I think I did.

860
01:36:58,279 --> 01:37:02,319
And I needed
to tell you something.

861
01:37:05,479 --> 01:37:08,319
You were never second.

862
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,479
Ever.

863
01:37:13,159 --> 01:37:17,159
I love you.

864
01:37:21,079 --> 01:37:24,640
You sleep now.

865
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:28,960
Everything will be
different in the morning.

866
01:37:33,399 --> 01:37:37,640
Good night,
Malcolm.

867
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:44,640
Good night,
sweetheart.{146641}{146716}
