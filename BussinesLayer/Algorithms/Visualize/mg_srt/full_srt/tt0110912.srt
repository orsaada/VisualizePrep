took the island,

your granddad asked a gunner on
an Air Force transport, name of Winocki-

970

in his life-

ever saw the watch,

it'd be confiscated,

this watch was your birthright.

I coulda done a better job.

Okay, first thing.
You two.

is take those cleaning products...

- You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

2083
02:22:31,882 --> 02:22:34,786
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2084
02:22:34,784 --> 02:22:36,721
- Let go of him!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2085
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:39,658
- Now, promise her
it's gonna be all right! - I promise!

2086
02:22:39,656 --> 02:22:41,693
- Tell her to chill!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2087
02:22:41,692 --> 02:22:43,628
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

2088
02:22:43,694 --> 02:22:47,187
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

2089
02:22:47,196 --> 02:22:50,134
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

2090
02:22:50,133 --> 02:22:53,774
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

2091
02:22:53,771 --> 02:22:57,437
- Come on, Yolanda!
What's Fonzie like? - He's cool.

2092
02:22:57,508 --> 02:22:59,443
- What?
- Cool.

2093
02:22:59,510 --> 02:23:02,345
Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

2094
02:23:02,412 --> 02:23:04,348
We're gonna be cool.

2095
02:23:04,414 --> 02:23:09,322
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2096
02:23:09,385 --> 02:23:11,480
And when I count three,

2097
02:23:11,555 --> 02:23:14,492
I want you to
let go of your gun,

2098
02:23:14,558 --> 02:23:18,019
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

2099
02:23:19,096 --> 02:23:21,157
And when you do it,

2100
02:23:21,231 --> 02:23:23,292
you do it cool.

2101
02:23:23,366 --> 02:23:25,701
You ready?

2102
02:23:25,769 --> 02:23:27,864
One,

2103
02:23:27,938 --> 02:23:30,135
two,

2104
02:23:30,207 --> 02:23:32,143
three.

2105
02:23:39,116 --> 02:23:42,247
- [ Panting ] Okay, now you let him go!
- Yolanda!

2106
02:23:42,245 --> 02:23:45,992
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,
when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

2107
02:23:45,989 --> 02:23:48,084
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

2108
02:23:48,158 --> 02:23:52,372
When motherfuckers get scared,
that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

2109
02:23:53,630 --> 02:23:57,262
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

2110
02:23:57,334 --> 02:24:00,739
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

2111
02:24:00,804 --> 02:24:02,740
But I don't want that.

2112
02:24:02,806 --> 02:24:04,742
And you don't want that.

2113
02:24:04,808 --> 02:24:07,541
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2114
02:24:07,611 --> 02:24:09,706
So let's see what we can do.

2115
02:24:12,116 --> 02:24:15,350
Now... here's the situation.

2116
02:24:15,419 --> 02:24:19,291
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

2117
02:24:19,288 --> 02:24:22,863
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

2118
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:25,798
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

2119
02:24:25,863 --> 02:24:29,803
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2120
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:32,872
Besides, I been through too much shit
over this case this morning...

2121
02:24:32,870 --> 02:24:35,808
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2122
02:24:35,873 --> 02:24:37,740
- Vincent!
- [ Yells ]

2123
02:24:37,808 --> 02:24:40,746
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
- Get back!

2124
02:24:40,811 --> 02:24:43,510
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

2125
02:24:43,581 --> 02:24:47,749
- Come on. Point the gun at me. Point the gun at me.
There you go. - [ Yolanda Whimpering ]

2126
02:24:47,818 --> 02:24:49,879
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

2127
02:24:49,953 --> 02:24:51,889
and don't do
a goddamn thing.

2128
02:24:51,955 --> 02:24:53,891
Tell her it's still cool.

2129
02:24:53,957 --> 02:24:56,895
- It's still cool, Honey Bunny.
- How we doin', baby?

2130
02:24:58,295 --> 02:25:00,960
I- I gotta go pee.

2131
02:25:01,031 --> 02:25:02,967
I wanna go home.

2132
02:25:03,033 --> 02:25:06,632
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringo's proud of you.

2133
02:25:06,704 --> 02:25:09,642
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

2134
02:25:09,707 --> 02:25:13,077
- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.
- I love you.

2135
02:25:13,143 --> 02:25:16,309
- I love you too, Honey Bunny.
- Now,

2136
02:25:16,380 --> 02:25:20,320
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

2137
02:25:22,854 --> 02:25:26,794
- Which one is it?
- It's the one that says "Bad Motherfucker."

2138
02:25:41,051 --> 02:25:43,614
That's it.
That's my bad motherfucker.

2139
02:25:43,687 --> 02:25:46,784
Open it up.
Take out the money.

2140
02:25:51,828 --> 02:25:53,991
[ Jules ]
Count it.

2141
02:26:00,302 --> 02:26:02,830
How much is there?

2142
02:26:04,741 --> 02:26:06,677
About 1,500 dollars.

2143
02:26:06,743 --> 02:26:09,943
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2144
02:26:10,013 --> 02:26:13,213
Now, with the rest
of those wallets and the register,

2145
02:26:13,211 --> 02:26:15,453
that makes this a pretty successful
little score, huh?

2146
02:26:15,451 --> 02:26:19,425
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500
dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle.

2147
02:26:19,422 --> 02:26:22,928
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

2148
02:26:22,926 --> 02:26:25,021
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2149
02:26:25,095 --> 02:26:28,967
- Shut up!
- Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

2150
02:26:29,032 --> 02:26:31,970
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

2151
02:26:32,035 --> 02:26:33,971
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

2152
02:26:35,205 --> 02:26:38,405
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
- What?

2153
02:26:38,474 --> 02:26:43,212
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

2154
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:45,979
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2155
02:26:47,050 --> 02:26:48,986
Not regularly, no.

2156
02:26:49,052 --> 02:26:51,488
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2157
02:26:51,555 --> 02:26:55,085
Ezekiel 25:17.

2158
02:26:55,158 --> 02:26:57,994
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2159
02:26:58,061 --> 02:26:59,997
by the inequities
of the selfish...

2160
02:27:00,063 --> 02:27:01,999
and the tyranny of evil men.

2161
02:27:02,065 --> 02:27:05,435
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and good will,

2162
02:27:05,433 --> 02:27:08,006
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

2163
02:27:08,004 --> 02:27:12,104
for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2164
02:27:12,175 --> 02:27:16,479
And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2165
02:27:16,547 --> 02:27:19,610
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2166
02:27:19,683 --> 02:27:22,712
And you will know
I am the Lord...

2167
02:27:22,786 --> 02:27:26,350
when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2168
02:27:27,424 --> 02:27:29,861
I been sayin' that shit for years,

2169
02:27:29,926 --> 02:27:33,092
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2170
02:27:33,163 --> 02:27:36,101
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2171
02:27:36,099 --> 02:27:39,171
I just thought it was some coldblooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2172
02:27:39,169 --> 02:27:41,606
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2173
02:27:41,672 --> 02:27:45,111
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2174
02:27:45,175 --> 02:27:48,113
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2175
02:27:48,178 --> 02:27:53,052
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2176
02:27:53,116 --> 02:27:56,054
and Mr. 9-millimeter here,
he's the shepherd...

2177
02:27:56,119 --> 02:27:59,684
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness.

2178
02:27:59,757 --> 02:28:01,693
Or it could mean...

2179
02:28:01,759 --> 02:28:05,198
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2180
02:28:05,262 --> 02:28:09,202
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2181
02:28:09,266 --> 02:28:11,533
Now, I'd like that.

2182
02:28:11,602 --> 02:28:14,506
But that shit
ain't the truth.

2183
02:28:14,572 --> 02:28:16,438
The truth is,

2184
02:28:17,508 --> 02:28:19,443
you're the weak...

2185
02:28:20,845 --> 02:28:24,249
and I'm the tyranny
of evil men.

2186
02:28:25,650 --> 02:28:27,586
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2187
02:28:28,853 --> 02:28:31,791
I'm tryin' real hard...

2188
02:28:31,856 --> 02:28:34,122
to be the shepherd.

2189
02:28:49,439 --> 02:28:51,375
Go.

2190
02:29:09,060 --> 02:29:11,496
I think we should be
leaving now.

2191
02:29:11,562 --> 02:29:14,499
- [ "Surf Rider" ]
- Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
