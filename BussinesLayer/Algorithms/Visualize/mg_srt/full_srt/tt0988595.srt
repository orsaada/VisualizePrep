00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:20,822
<i>- [Jane] This is my building.
- I got it.</i>

167
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,834
- No. I got it.
- Sure?

168
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:25,097
Yeah.

169
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:28,571
All right, sweetie. A hundred and forty.
You know what you did.

170
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:31,439
Hey! What's-- No.
He's gonna be right back. Hold on.

171
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:34,570
Don't you think it's a whole lot of ritual
for something that--

172
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:37,844
Let's face it-- It's got about a 50-50 shot
of making it out of the gate.

173
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,078
[Sighs] How very refreshing.
A man who doesn't believe in marriage.

174
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:42,654
- I'm just trying to point out
the hypocrisy of the spectacle.
- Oh.

175
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:44,746
That's so noble of you.
Do you also go around...

176
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:46,757
telling small children
that Santa Claus doesn't exist?

177
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:48,759
'Cause someone needs
to blow that shit wide open.

178
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:52,297
So you admit that believing in marriage
is kind of like believing in Santa Claus.

179
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:54,628
No. I--

180
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:58,902
I don't know why I'm arguing
this with a perfect stranger.

181
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:01,769
But, yes, marriage, like everything good
and important, isn't easy.

182
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:04,604
Cynicism, on the other hand,
always is.

183
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:07,475
- It was very interesting meeting you.
- Bye.

184
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,810
Yeah.

185
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,941
You gonna be in more
weddings next weekend?

186
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,383
<i>- I have to go.
- How many have you been in, by the way?</i>

187
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:17,320
<i>- Just, like, ballpark.
- Good night.</i>

188
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:28,129
<i>- Hey, you know what? Could you--
- Yeah?</i>

189
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:31,032
<i>- Forget it.
- Yup.</i>

190
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:17,574
Okay.
[Sighs]

191
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:20,151
- [Door Creaking]
- [Sighs]

192
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:24,248
## [Humming]

193
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:28,885
[Sighs] Death. Destruction.
Wedding vows. Yea.

194
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,021
[Sighs]
Come to mama.

195
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:39,263
Oh.

196
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:48,407
<i>[Bells Tolling]</i>

197
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,418
<i>[Man] Jeter hit a walk-off
in the ninth. Did you see it?</i>

198
00:12:57,523 --> 00:12:59,548
Uh, no. I work
Saturday nights, remember?

199
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:02,628
- Here. From the happy couple.
- Oh, that's right.

200
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:07,028
You were eating coconut cake
and doing the Electric Slide.

201
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:09,124
- So how'd it go?
- Oh, let's see.

202
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,726
The bride wore a gown that sparkled
like the groom's eyes...

203
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:15,137
as he saw her approaching
through a shower of rose petals.

204
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:17,471
And you're not
getting laid?

205
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,841
Commitments is the gold standard
of wedding announcements.

206
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:22,710
Every girl on the planet rips open that page,
first thing Sunday.

207
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,010
Brides kill to get in there.

208
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:28,144
Do you have any idea
what you can be doin'?

209
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:30,449
- You mean to women who are
about to get married?
- Yeah.

210
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:32,456
They won't call you.
They won't bother you.

211
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:35,459
They will pretend they never even met you.
You can't beat that.

212
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,825
Well, it's not gonna
matter much longer anyway.

213
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,297
- You're looking at my ticket
out of the taffeta ghetto.
- Keep on dreaming.

214
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,427
- Uh, go away.
- Yes. Okay.

215
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,673
What? I wasn't gonna come
to work in my bridesmaid dress.

216
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:56,043
Two-day walk of shame outfit.
Elegant.

217
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:58,709
[Laughing]

218
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:01,048
What happened to you
the other night?

219
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:03,782
You were barely there,
and then you disappeared.

220
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,620
- You meet someone?
- Come on. No.

221
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:08,694
Oh. Ridiculous question.

222
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:10,955
[Scoffs]

223
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:13,031
- Good morning, Gina.
- Hi.

224
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:16,829
- You haven't seen my Filofax
anywhere, have you?
- No.

225
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:18,961
No. Okay.
I'll go look for it.

226
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:22,905
- Did you get those catalog pages in for George?
- No.

227
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:25,534
Okay. No worries.
I'll get them from production.

228
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:28,813
Attagirl.
Show her who's boss.

229
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:31,349
- I'm not her boss.
- You're the boss's assistant.

230
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,419
Same diff. What's the good of your job
if you can't abuse the power?

231
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,511
- Casey, go to Accounting.
- Now you're bossy.

232
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,522
[Laughs]

233
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:45,322
Where the hell
did I put that thing?

234
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:48,229
That is a great idea for the front page
of the section.

235
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:50,859
Oh, come on, Doyle. How many times
have I heard this from you?

236
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,938
<i>- I'm telling you, Maureen. It's a great idea.
- Really?</i>

237
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,373
As great as your last great idea, an expose
on price-fixing at wedding bakeries?

238
00:14:57,476 --> 00:15:00,172
Yes! Yes! They're ripping people off.
Flour costs pennies per ounce.

239
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,645
That's an 8000/0 markup.
It's outrageous.

240
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:04,909
Yes, it is.
Also, no one cares.

241
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:08,111
What about the piece I wanted to do on
the exploitation of workers in lace factories?

242
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:10,121
- That is a killer piece.
- Oh, right.

243
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,691
That's what people really wanna
read about in the Style section.

244
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:16,853
<i>Kevin, this section practically
pays for the entire paper.</i>

245
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:20,228
Our advertisers want fun, upbeat,
colorful human-interest stories...

246
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,131
- opposite their products.
- So that's what we're about now? Making money?

247
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,966
- Get out.
- All right. Listen. That was not right.

248
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:28,131
I get it. But this one is.
Look, this woman...

249
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:30,334
- has been in seven weddings--
- So?

250
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:34,209
This year. She was in two
on Saturday alone.

251
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:36,474
- [Sighs]
- But it won't just be about her.

252
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:39,608
<i>It'll be an incisive look at how the wedding
industry has transformed something...</i>

253
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:43,985
that should be an important rite
of passage into nothing more
than a corporate revenue stream.

254
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:49,259
In a fun, upbeat, you know,
cheerful way.

255
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,887
Look, Maureen, I am dying
back there in Commitments.

256
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:55,092
If I have to write another sentence about
baby's breath, I'm gonna shoot myself.

257
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:57,169
This is a real story.
This is what I wanna do.

258
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,932
I need you covering weddings.
That's what you're good at.

259
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,007
And that's what
I need you to do.

260
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:04,736
If you don't start giving me feature stories,
I'm gonna have to quit.

261
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:09,281
One chance. If I don't like it, you go back
to Commitments for the rest of your life...

262
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:12,146
with a big smile on that ridiculously
handsome face of yours.

263
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:15,084
Deal.

264
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:18,986
- You think he'll like these?
- Yes, I do.

265
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:23,084
<i>I think those photos for the fall catalog will
cause George to take you into his office...</i>

266
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:27,029
- and make sweet love to you for hours and hours.
- Shh! Casey.

267
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:30,830
Tell me that crazy crush is the reason you
work as hard as you do, 'cause it's upsetting.

268
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:34,064
-Just like my job. Okay?
- No. You just think that one day...

269
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:37,506
George is gonna wake up and realize
that he is madly in love with you...

270
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,374
- and he's gonna make some
spectacular gesture of love--
- Flowers for Jane Nichols.

271
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:43,039
Yeah. That's me.
Thank you.

272
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:48,153
That's great. I spent two days in bed
with a guy, and you get flowers.

273
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:50,313
- Nice.
- There's no note.

274
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:55,650
Oh,Jane. You don't seriously think
they're from your dream guy, do you?

275
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,855
Gina, can you take these
to my desk for me?

276
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:00,329
- Sure. No problem.
- Thank you.

277
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,731
Would you please stop
saying that? Nobody knows.

278
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,860
Everybody knows,Jane,
except George.

279
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,404
It's true.

280
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:11,875
- [Barking]
- Gatsby! Hi, buddy. Hi!

281
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:14,844
Whoa! Come on, Gatsby.
No slobbering on the ladies.

282
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:17,040
[Sighs]
Hi.

283
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:22,420
- How was it?
- It was phenomenal. Up and back...

284
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,785
in 10 hours--
our best time yet.

285
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,915
Isn't that, like, the eighth time
you climbed Mount Whitney?

286
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:30,154
- How do you remember that stuff,Jane?
- I don't know.

287
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:33,754
- So we just got these in. What do you think?
- I think they're too corporate.

288
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:36,494
<i>That's what I was thinking. They don't
have enough of a feel of being-</i>

289
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,832
Outdoors. Right. I mean,
there's no adventure.

290
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:41,429
There's no danger. Plus, everyone
looks way too put together.

291
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,770
Yeah. Like models. Got it.
I will talk to Marketing.

292
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,776
See? That's why I keep
you around,Jane.

293
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:48,176
- I mean, who else could finish my sentences?
- [Laughs]

294
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,180
Your design meeting
is at 11:00.

295
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:53,251
And the 92nd Street Y called to confirm
that you'll be attending their benefit.

296
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:55,320
- You wanna go?
- Do I have to make a speech?

297
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:58,549
Just a few words about ecologically
responsible business practices.

298
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:00,625
Something light and fun.
You in?

299
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:02,717
Yeah. Yeah, let's do it.
Put it on the calendar...

300
00:18:02,828 --> 00:18:05,126
but I'm probably gonna need
to dig up a date for that, huh?

301
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:07,927
- Yeah. Probably.
- At least that's the one thing in my life...

302
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:10,934
-you don't have to take care of for me, right?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:13,436
[Sighs]

304
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:16,201
Oh, my... God!

305
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:18,367
<i>- Leave me alone.
- Jane!</i>

306
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:21,378
- Yeah?
- Did you put that breakfast burrito on my desk?

307
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,380
I just thought
you might be hungry.

308
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:25,575
That's why I love ya.

309
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,650
I love you too.

310
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:32,952
Oh! Yeah.

311
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:35,083
Yeah. You're right.
I needed that.

312
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:41,965
<i>Okay, everybody. I hope to see you all
at my engagement party tonight.</i>

313
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:45,127
<i>And,Jane, thanks again
for arranging everything.</i>

314
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:47,467
No problem.

315
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:52,140
Do you wanna come over
to my place before the party?

316
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:54,212
Some of the guys from Shipping
are coming...

317
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:57,180
- and they're bringing tequila and bubble wrap.
- Fun!

318
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:59,478
I can't. I gotta pick up
Tess from the airport.

319
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:04,022
God! Wouldn't it be great if there was
a service that you could hire to do that?

320
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:08,150
Like yellow cars or shiny
black sedans--

321
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,251
I want to pick her up.
She's my baby sister.

322
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:12,330
Plus, she needs
my help, so--

323

<i>Yeah. Yeah,just doin' a little bit of cleaning.
Harnessing my chi. [Chuckles]</i>

487
00:28:54,513 --> 00:28:58,108
Janey, I had...

488
00:28:58,216 --> 00:29:00,741
the best night ever.

489
00:29:00,852 --> 00:29:03,446
<i>Oh, that's right!
I totally forgot you went out.</i>

490
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:05,853
- Ow!
- Is that weird for you?

491
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:09,620
What? Weird? Why would it be weird?
He's my boss. I don't care. Whatever.

492
00:29:09,728 --> 00:29:12,526
- Okay. Great. 'Cause we're
having lunch tomorrow.
- That's so great!

493
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:15,600
<i>Yeah. I think so too.
Except not quite at that decibel.</i>

495
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:20,663

Oh. Well. I--

497
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:27,779
Uh, he, uh--

498
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:31,872
Well, he dropped
out of college...

499
00:29:31,983 --> 00:29:35,282
<i>and then climbed
every major peak in the world.</i>

500
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:37,355
And then he started Urban Everest
from his apartment...

501
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:41,187
and turned it into one of the most eco-friendly
philanthropic businesses in the world--

502
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:43,261
all before he was 30.

503
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:45,261
- Wow.
- Yeah.

504
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:48,230
And that's just his resume.
He is an unbelievable boss.
Everybody loves him. Everybody.

505
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,927
And he loves his dog, Gatsby,
more than anyone.

506
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:53,163
He doesn't eat red meat,
which is kinda cool.

507
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:57,002
And he would rather spend
all his time outside than anywhere else.

508
00:29:57,109 --> 00:29:59,509
My God.
He sounds amazing.

509

[Sighing]

510
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,274
Yeah. Yeah, but he has flaws.
He does.

511
00:30:04,382 --> 00:30:06,282
He is flawed.

512
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:10,912
- What do you mean?
- Well, he hates cashews...

513
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,990
which is weird.

514
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:16,151
And sometimes he doesn't
wear socks with sneakers.

515
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:18,456
I just think that's gross.

516
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:21,623
Jane.Jane, those aren't
exactly deal-breakers.

517
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:24,964
Deal. Wh-What deal?

518
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:28,870
I mean, nothing happened
between the two of you tonight, did it?

519
00:30:28,974 --> 00:30:31,534
- Did it?
- Well.

520
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:35,602
<i>Oh. I got ya. Nice.</i>

521
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:37,909

[Laughs, Sighs] Oh, Dad. This place
looks exactly the same.

528

Now that's not fair.

529
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:08,135
I got a brand-new awning. I just stripped
and re-varnished all the woodwork. Look.

530
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:10,544
- New cash register. Digital.
- Oh.

Wow, Dad. I'm sorry.
I don't know how I missed all these...

532
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:15,218

- No.
- Good, 'cause I love 'em!

One to two weeks, right?
That's what you said.

539
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:36,533
Um, actually, it just depends
on how a few things pan out.

540
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:39,542
What things?

You ripped a week out of my planner.
Are you insane?

560
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:47,175
It's a little experiment. See how you do
without every second of your life mapped out.

By the way,
your life is insane.

work and help people get married?

You know what? I don't see how
that's any of your business.

How do you afford
these weddings?

Hey, people love that gift.
And I'm a frequent member.

- Chili dog. You want a chili dog?
- Uh, no.

- I'm sorry. What?

599
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:40,920
- You're a vegetarian?
- Uh-huh. It's recent.

600
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:43,960
- Oh, is it?
- You know, 'cause I'm a vegetarian too.

601
00:34:44,062 --> 00:34:46,553
- Oh.
- I used to be a vegan,
but it was too much of a hassle.

602
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:49,929
Oh, God. I know. I mean, even being
a vegetarian is a challenge.

603
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:53,936
I mean, every time I go hiking, I have
to bring my homemade "to furky jerky."

604
00:34:54,038 --> 00:34:56,700
You go hiking?
I mean, no offense...

605
00:34:56,808 --> 00:34:59,868
but you hardly seem like the kind of girl
that hits the trails--

606
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:01,969
Especially
in those shoes.

607
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,243
Don't be silly. The best "to furky"
is made by publicists in kitten heels.

608
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,046
I can see how you would think that,
but I actually love...

609
00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:10,053
all that outdoorsy
type of stuff--

610
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:13,921
You know, hiking and biking
and climbing up things.

611
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:19,725
But, to tell you the truth, I haven't been
hiking since--Well, since my dog died.

612
00:35:19,831 --> 00:35:22,425
See Jane and I had this
dog growing up, Tory.

613
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:24,434
I just-- I loved him.

614
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:29,769
He would just go on nature hikes
and climbing adventures.

615
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:34,106
Not a day goes by that I don't think about
that bag of fleas.

616
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:37,113
Good ol' Tory.

617
00:35:37,215 --> 00:35:40,309
Jane, how come you never
mentioned Tory?

618
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:44,855
<i>I don't know. I must have
repressed the memory of Toby.</i>

619
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:51,291
Yeah. His name was "Toby," but I called him
"Tory" because I had a lisp.

620
00:35:51,396 --> 00:35:54,593
A lisp that turned
your "B's" to "R's"?

621
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:56,633
You know what?
When I was a kid, I had a stutter.

622
00:35:56,734 --> 00:35:58,702
No way!

623
00:35:58,803 --> 00:36:01,931
- We have more things
in common than I thought.
- Yeah, me too.

624
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:09,678
I'm gonna go out and shag
some flies with Pedro.

625
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:13,376
Ooh! I'm jealous. It sounds fun.
[Laughs]

626
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:16,686
- What are "shagging flies"?
- What are you doing?

627
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:19,382
- What?
- You hate dogs and tofu and being outside.

628
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:23,427
No. I like yachts. I like flowers.
I like, you know, tanning.

629
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:26,361
- I mean, it's not exactly the same--
- And you hated Toby.

630
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:29,490
You hated him. The only animals you ever
cared about are dead ones with sleeves.

631
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:33,594
You're just saying all this stuff
because George is so... attractive.

632
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:36,697
- Or some people think he is.
- I did not hate that dog.

633
00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:38,708
I just hated it
when he slobbered on me.

634
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:43,406
And I could like soy milk
and hiking if I tried it. Maybe.

635
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:48,175
Hey, Tess. What do you say
you come out here. Let's see that arm.

636
00:36:48,286 --> 00:36:51,687
Ooh. Fun. Are we gonna shag now?
[Giggles]

637
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:57,419

- No. I don't know how to do this.

00:36:57,529 --> 00:36:59,156
- Here you go.
- Okay. Like that?

639
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,858
Put this arm down there. All right?
Hold that elbow up.

I'm sorry. I know

Just don't listen to her. Your boobs came
in eventually. They just missed high school.

774
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:52,569
As for the third bridesmaid,
I want you to ask your friend...

775
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,661

- Casey?

She's really pretty.
She can pull off the strapless.

00:44:59,677 --> 00:45:02,703
I don't have that many girlfriends.
For some reason, girls just don't like me.

00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:07,978
Okay. Fine. I know why.

00:45:11,022 --> 00:45:12,990
[Sighs]
Sure. Of course.

782
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:16,253
So I was also thinking we could
do a slide show for the rehearsal dinner.

783
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,693
You know, put pictures of George
and I together and say funny things.

a wedding just like Mom and Dad's.

790
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:41,381
-Just like?
- You know, especially since
I'm wearing Mom's dress.

791
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:44,249
So, ta-da!

792

793
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:51,293
At first, when I called, they said they had
no availability for 18 months.

794
00:45:51,395 --> 00:45:54,296
But then the ninth time I called,
they said they had a cancellation.

795
00:45:54,398 --> 00:45:57,094
Apparently the bride slept
with the groom's father and brother...

796
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:59,294
and sister
and all these people.

797
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:02,531
So, obviously, it got canceled
and they were all devastated.

798
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,608
But which means...

799
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:06,869
we're getting married

Uh-huh. Oh,Jane. I know
you can pull it together quickly.

802
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:14,545

that long anyway, so--

00:46:21,826 --> 00:46:26,126
No, I am. I am.
It's just--

806
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:29,165
It's just that you wanted to get married
at The Boathouse in Mom's dress too.

807
00:46:29,266 --> 00:46:32,633
I know.

808
00:46:32,736 --> 00:46:35,864
No, I just-- I didn't know that
that's what you wanted...

809
00:46:35,973 --> 00:46:38,737
but if it is, then I just want
you to be happy.

810
00:46:38,843 --> 00:46:40,970
- You know that.
- Great!

811
00:46:41,078 --> 00:46:43,478
Okay. Now can we talk about
more important stuff?

812
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:47,449
Come on. I really don't like the linens,
and I think we need to rent new ones...

813
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,452
because they do not go with the color
scheme that I picked out.

814
00:46:50,554 --> 00:46:52,988

You can't plan your sister's
wedding to the man you love. It's sick.

820
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,867
To be fair, she didn't
know how I felt about him.

821
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:14,604
And nor should she--
He's my boss.

822
00:47:14,712 --> 00:47:18,079
I'm just gonna have to get over it.
I don't really have a choice.

831
00:47:38,502 --> 00:47:41,801
Because it's you. But if she crosses me,
I'm gonna kick her ass.

832
00:47:41,906 --> 00:47:45,137

brought you the Schecters...

838
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:10,995

Well, I use "Malcolm" for the byline

- You're an asshole.

No. I told you I was a writer.
I didn't tell you what I wrote.

But-- But you write
the most beautiful things.

871
00:49:45,129 --> 00:49:47,962
Do you actually believe in love
and marriage and pretend to be a cynic...

872
00:49:48,065 --> 00:49:52,365
or are you a cynic who knows how to spin
romantic crap for girls like me?

873
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:56,371
I didn't follow that at all. But I think
the second one, the spinning crap one.

874
00:49:56,473 --> 00:50:01,638
Oh, my God. I feel like I found out my favorite
love song was written about a sandwich.

I couldn't be happier.
She's my kid sister.

893
00:51:17,388 --> 00:51:19,583
I taught her how to tell time,
how to ride a bike...

894

how to steam flounder
in the dishwasher.

00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:25,287

Oh, please, don't print that.

00:51:25,396 --> 00:51:28,627

00:55:25,636 --> 00:55:28,833
I don't get it. All right. You--
You do the thing, you have the dress.

966
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:31,339
Just throw it out.
That's a huge closet.

967
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:33,534
You live in New York.
You cannot be eating up space like that.

968
00:55:33,644 --> 00:55:36,841
Strange as it sounds, I've had some
really good times in those dresses.

969
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:38,972
- Weird as that may be.
- I don't believe you.

<i>I don't care if somebody wants me
to wear a funny dress.</i>

971
00:55:41,585 --> 00:55:44,281
- It's their day, not mine.
- God bless you.

972
00:55:44,388 --> 00:55:46,948
<i>And if supporting them
when they get married means...</i>

973
00:55:47,057 --> 00:55:49,355
snowshoeing to a mountaintop
in the Alps or...

974
00:55:49,459 --> 00:55:53,156
<i>- helping to caulk a fountain
for some swans, then-
- You actually did that?</i>

975
00:55:53,263 --> 00:55:57,131
Oh, I'm a really,
very good caulker.

976
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:02,696
- Likes caulk.

00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:04,865
All right.
But come on. Seriously.

978
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:07,569
I mean, how much time do you spend
doing this for other people?

979
00:56:07,678 --> 00:56:09,703

You don't have any needs?

980

That bridesmaid story--
what do you have so far?

1004
00:57:41,338 --> 00:57:44,102
Uh, it's a little rough.
I'm still workin' on it.

1005
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:46,175
- I want to see it.
- I'm not even--

<i>- Right now. E-mail it.

finished with it. It's not done.</i>

1007
00:57:59,556 --> 00:58:01,786
<i>[Jane] Can you go away, please?
I did not invite you.</i>

1008
00:58:01,892 --> 00:58:06,420
Well, luckily Tess did. When I cover
a wedding, I gotta see every aspect.

1009
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,158
You know, your sister wants so many
presents from so many stores...

1010
00:58:09,266 --> 00:58:11,496
that she physically cannot register
for them all herself.

1011
00:58:11,601 --> 00:58:14,502
- She's pressed for time. It's a short engagement.
- [Beeping]

1012

Good God.
Another one?

1013
00:58:16,773 --> 00:58:18,673
To you, it's just
another casserole dish.

1014
00:58:18,775 --> 00:58:21,369
To Tess, it's the pot she's gonna
cook my mother's Christmas roast in.

1015
00:58:21,478 --> 00:58:23,946
Oh, Tess cooks?

1016
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:26,413
All right. Well, I'm gonna cook it.
But Tess will be there...

1017
00:58:26,516 --> 00:58:28,416
with George.

1018
00:58:28,518 --> 00:58:30,543
- And this isn't just another "vahze."
- Vase.

1019
00:58:30,654 --> 00:58:33,248
This is the "vahze"
that Tess will get out...

1020
00:58:33,356 --> 00:58:37,087
when George brings home flowers,
just because he felt like it.

1021
00:58:37,194 --> 00:58:39,389
I see. And this--

1022
00:58:39,496 --> 00:58:44,297
this is the rooster-shaped umbrella holder
that will hold all of George's umbrellas.

1023
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:46,892
Fine. Be a jerk.

1024
00:58:47,003 --> 00:58:49,972
All I'm saying
is that this isn't just stuff.

1025

<i>- These are the things
that make up a life together.
- No.</i>

1026
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:56,140
This is the useless crap that the
70-billion-dollar-a-year wedding industry...

1027
00:58:56,246 --> 00:58:59,010
has convinced us all that we have
to have or we won't be happy.

1028

<i>You know what I think?
I think that all your statistics and theories...</i>

1029

are just
a smoke screen.

1030
00:59:04,654 --> 00:59:08,055
- Oh, really? For what?
- Your little secret--whatever it is.

1031
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:11,059
Your parents got divorced.
You haven't found the right girl.

1032

- You're afraid you never will.
- Mm-hmm.

1033
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,430
And I think
you love weddings so much...

1034
00:59:15,532 --> 00:59:19,366
because you'd rather focus on other people's
Kodak moments than make memories of your own.

1035
00:59:19,469 --> 00:59:22,870
You're right. Know why? Because weddings are
the perfect place to forget about being single.

1036
00:59:22,973 --> 00:59:25,498
I think you want a wedding--
not a marriage, a wedding.

1037
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:28,203
What is your problem?

1038
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:31,439
Did you have your own fancy wedding
and your wife left you or something?

1039
00:59:32,682 --> 00:59:34,914
Bingo.

1040
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:36,918
What?

1041
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,920
With my roommate from college,
by the way.

1042
00:59:39,022 --> 00:59:41,081
So I think you get
an extra bingo for that.

1043
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:46,185
Oh, shit.
Kevin, I'm--

1044
00:59:46,296 --> 00:59:48,764

It was a guess.

<i>It was a good one.</i>

1046
00:59:50,867 --> 00:59:53,700
For someone who has
no insight whatsoever into herself...

1047
00:59:53,803 --> 00:59:55,703
you nailed me
right on the head.

1048
00:59:57,474 --> 01:00:00,272

and register Tess for it?

<i>- I told you I was not done with it yet.
- No, it's good.</i>

1053
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,625
I meant,
"Wow, it's actually decent."

1054
01:00:22,732 --> 01:00:25,428

I was shocked...</i>

01:00:25,535 --> 01:00:29,301
<i>but, uh, it's smart
and, uh, biting...</i>

1056
01:00:29,406 --> 01:00:31,306

I just--

1061

- Wait. You've been begging me for months...

1063
01:00:50,894 --> 01:00:54,091
and now you want me to hold the story
so you can move some commas around?

1064
01:00:54,197 --> 01:00:57,257
I don't know. Now that I'm in it, she's more
than just this perpetual bridesmaid.

1065
01:00:57,367 --> 01:01:00,495
You know, I don't know. There's--
There's a lot more to her than that.

<i>Huh. If I didn't know you
any better...</i>

1067
01:01:03,006 --> 01:01:05,668
I would say that you'd
developed a little crush.

01:01:05,775 --> 01:01:08,539
Very funny. Look, I know
I can make it better.

1069
01:01:08,645 --> 01:01:12,103

Oh, it's no problem.
I'm happy to help.

- Hey, listen. Any chance you know where Jane is?

1079
01:01:54,691 --> 01:01:58,457
Yeah, you know, the thing that I like
about Tess is there's no bullshit.

1080
01:01:58,561 --> 01:02:01,257
You know,
she's not afraid to be herself.

1081

There's something that I want to say.

- Um--
- What?

1083
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:16,910
I'm just so happy for you,
that you found what you were looking for.

1084
01:02:17,013 --> 01:02:20,073
All right.
So what's your favorite part...

of a wedding?

1086
01:02:21,618 --> 01:02:23,643
Oh, that's easy.

1087
01:02:23,753 --> 01:02:26,313
You know when the music starts
and the bride makes her big entrance...

1088
01:02:26,423 --> 01:02:27,890
and everybody turns
to look at her?

1089
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:30,755
That's when I look at the groom.
'Cause his face says it all.

1090

You know,
the pure love there.

<i>Okay. So when you get married
and you make your entrance...</i>

1093

- What? No. No. That's okay.

Um, I can get you back on time.
I got my dad's Volvo, and that thing books.

I-- I thought
you were wearing Mom's dress.

It is Mom's dress.
Well, parts of it.

- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1343

about anyone but yourself, do you?

1354

died when you were little. But enough is enough!

I can't undo what you've just done.
But I won't let you hurt George.

1357
01:18:16,105 --> 01:18:19,472
He thinks he knows the truth about you,
but all he knows are the lies you've told him.

1358
01:18:19,575 --> 01:18:22,408
You even had Pedro
keep a secret from George.

1359
01:18:22,511 --> 01:18:24,502
You tell him the truth
right now!

1360
01:18:24,613 --> 01:18:27,741
He is not one of your Eurotrash boyfriends,
Tess. He is a good person.

1361
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:30,512
And you cannot start a relationship
based on lies.

1362
01:18:30,619 --> 01:18:34,885
Oh, really,Jane? And you know this
because of all your successful relationships?

1363
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:38,484
You tell him the truth,
or I will.

1364
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:42,496
No, you won't. You wouldn't hurt a fly.
And you definitely wouldn't hurt me.

1365
01:18:42,598 --> 01:18:45,260
- I'm your sister.
- That was yesterday.

1366

Today you're just some bitch who broke my
heart and cut up my mother's wedding dress.

Well, it wouldn't have
fit you anyway.

Oh,Jane.
You look wonderful.

1369
01:19:15,364 --> 01:19:17,264
Good for you.

Oh, honey, it must be so hard to watch
your younger sister get married before you.

Yes. Yes, it is.

1372

<i>George, wait, please.
Let me explain.</i>

1454
01:24:17,866 --> 01:24:20,096
So what happened?

1455
01:24:22,003 --> 01:24:25,871
<i>- He needed to know the truth.

I mean, I know that my moral compass
doesn't exactly point due north...

1457
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:33,945
but if I say something's wrong,
something's wrong.

1458
01:24:36,251 --> 01:24:39,186
You're the one who is always telling me
to stand up for myself.

1459
01:24:39,287 --> 01:24:41,881
<i>Yeah. But that's
not what you did.</i>

1460
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:45,084
What you did was unleash 20 years
of repressed feelings in one night.

1461
01:24:45,193 --> 01:24:47,093
It was entertaining--
don't get me wrong--

1462
01:24:47,195 --> 01:24:50,858
<i>but if it was the right thing to do,
you'd feel better right now.</i>

right now?

- No, it doesn't matter.
