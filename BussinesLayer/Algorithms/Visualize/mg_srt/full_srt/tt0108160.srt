1
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,108
Mommy got sick.

2
00:00:42,183 --> 00:00:45,118
It happened just like that.

3
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:48,519
There was nothing anybody could do.

4
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,581
It isn't fair.

5
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:52,649
There's no reason.

6
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:57,892
But if we start asking why,
we'll go crazy.

7
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:25,816
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one
of them. They're done. Ready to eat.

8
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:29,329
Do you know how to make juice?

9
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:36,035
Microwave. Five minutes.

10
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,380
Here.

11
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,947
My shrink. Call him.

12
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:09,335
"Loss of Spouse Support Group.

13
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,240
Chicago Cancer Family Network.

14
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:16,902
Parents Without Partners.
Partners Without Parents.

15
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:20,038
Hug Yourself. Hug a Friend.
Hug a Shrink."

16
00:02:20,114 --> 00:02:22,105
Or work. Work hard.

17
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:27,450
Work will save you. Work is the only
thing that will see you through this.

18
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:35,227
Don't mind him. He's just a guy
who's lost his wife.

19
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:45,868
What I think we really
need is a change.

20
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,104
Good idea. Take a couple of weeks off.
Get some sun. Take Jonah fishing.

21
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:55,905
No, a real change.

22
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:58,918
A new city.

23
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:03,616
Someplace where every time I go around
a corner I don't think of Maggie.

24
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:12,622
<i>Where you gonna go?</i>

25
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:20,199
I was thinking about Seattle.

26
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:25,007
Eventually, in a few months,
you'll start seeing women.

27
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,047
- You'll meet someone.
- Right.

28
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,709
Move on. Right.
That's what I'm gonna do.

29
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:32,617
And then in a few months, boom, I'll
be fine. I'll just grow a new heart.

30
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:34,882
- Sam, I'm sorry.
- She didn't mean that.

31
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:38,983
I know. Look,
it just doesn't happen twice.

32
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:42,828
<i>You must remember this</i>

33
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:45,832
<i>A kiss is still a kiss</i>

34
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,063
<i>A sigh is just a sigh</i>

35
00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:56,900
<i>The fundamental things apply</i>

36
00:03:56,978 --> 00:03:59,538
<i>As time goes by</i>

37
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:06,745
<i>And when two lovers woo</i>

38
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:09,688
<i>They still say, I love you</i>

39
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:12,749
<i>On that you can rely</i>

40
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,761
<i>No matter what the future brings</i>

41
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:23,599
<i>As time goes by</i>

42
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:30,836
<i>Moonlight and love songs</i>

43
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:33,745
<i>Never out of date</i>

44
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,306
<i>Hearts full of passion</i>

45
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:39,547
<i>Jealousy and hate</i>

46
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,952
<i>Woman needs man</i>

47
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:44,821
<i>And man must have his mate</i>

48
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:49,386
<i>That no one can deny</i>

49
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:53,531
<i>It's still the same old story</i>

50
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:56,536
<i>A fight for love and glory</i>

51
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:59,596
<i>A case of do or die</i>

52
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,479
<i>The world will</i>
<i>always welcome lovers</i>

53
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:11,274
<i>As time</i>

54
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:15,288
<i>Goes by</i>

55
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:31,699
The tall <i>one</i> with red hair
is your cousin Irene.

56
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:33,967
You'll recognize her by
the disappointed look on her face.

57
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,272
Who was married to Harold
who ran off with his secretary.

58
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:41,042
But came back because Irene threatened
to put the dog to sleep if he didn't.

59
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:44,551
Your brother Dennis
is a professor at Johns Hopkins.

60
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:49,480
He's married to Betsy.

61
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,889
The most competitive woman
in the world.

62
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,893
I don't see how
I'm gonna remember all this.

63
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:56,589
Oh, well, Walter, you will.

64
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:11,038
Your Uncle Milton
lost all of his money...

65
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:14,343
- And some other people's.
- In a pyramid scheme.

66
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,748
Don't mention the IRS
or the federal prison system.

67
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:21,549
Your mother's Barbara.
Your father's Cliff.

68
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:25,718
- My father has electric trains.
- Really?

69
00:06:25,793 --> 00:06:28,921
Am I what they had in mind?

70
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:32,056
Oh, Walter,
they're gonna love you.

71
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:36,569
<i>Everybody.</i>

72
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:39,128
Annie has an announcement.

73
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,572
Walter and I are engaged.

74
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,612
Thank you. Thank you.

75
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:55,117
Dad, Mom knew.

76
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:58,556
- I don't see a ring, Annie.
- I don't have a ring yet.

77
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,560
Congratulations.

78
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,658
Bless you. Bless you.

79
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,260
- Oh, my goodness.
- Are you all right?

80
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:11,328
- It's nothing.
- Maybe it's the flowers.

81
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:14,272
- We'll move them.
- No! Don't touch them!

82
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:16,776
I feel terrible,
sneezing at a time like this.

83
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:18,903
This is a very
important moment for me.

84
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,039
<i>He's</i> allergic to everything.
<i>Don't</i> worry about it.

85
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:24,209
Bees. I'm allergic to bees.

86
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:27,220
Harold is allergic
to every type of bee.

87
00:07:27,288 --> 00:07:31,224
We always have to carry a hypodermic
of adrenaline wherever we go.

88
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:33,726
If he eats even
one tiny piece of a nut...

89
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:37,252
My head swells up like
a watermelon, and I drop dead.

90
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,027
It's the same
with Harold and bees.

91
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:44,595
Your mother and I had salmon at our
wedding. A wedding without cold salmon...

92
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,641
- I'm not allergic to salmon.
- Oh, he's not allergic to salmon.

93
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,268
I don't think,
but you never know.

94
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,939
- You never know.
- Harold wasn't always allergic to bees.

95
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,951
Honey, what a shame. We had
some champagne. What did we use it for?

96
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,283
- Uncle <i>Milton's</i> parole.
- And it was delicious.

97
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,049
It was, wasn't it, Milton?

98
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:04,148
When are you getting married?

99
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:07,490
- In early June, in the garden.
- Does it have to be in the garden?

100
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:11,224
- What a great idea.
- What about Harold and bees?

101
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:14,665
- I'm allergic to bees.
- We'll spray you.

102
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:18,569
Cold salmon, a lovely
cucumber salad, strawberries.

103
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,131
I'm afraid I am allergic
to strawberries.

104
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,404
Allergic to strawberries.

105
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,641
Is this all right
with you, Walter?

106
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,081
Today I consider myself
the luckiest...

107
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:33,917
m-m-man on the f-f-face
of the -E-Earth.

108
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:37,287
The Lou Gehrig line.
Remember? Remember, Dad?

109
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:39,553
- The Lou Gehrig line from...
- <i>Pride of the Yankees.</i>

110
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:41,788
- <i>Pride of the Yankees!</i>
- <i>Pride of the Yankees.</i>

111
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:45,298
- It's baseball.
- A historical reference.

112
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:50,201
I would like to propose a toast
to my kid sister.

113
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:53,035
To Walter and my baby.

114
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:56,042
To Walter and Annie.

115
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,613
Everyone, please eat
before it gets cold.

116
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:05,982
Here it is.

117
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:10,080
The historical society wanted this,
and I never would give it to them.

118
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:12,352
<i>Oh, Mom!

119
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,088
I noticed these things
are back in fashion.

120
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:19,565
- Grandmother's dress.
- Oh, honey.

121
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:22,124
He's a lovely man, Annie.

122
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:27,266
I know. He is wonderful, isn't he?
And he's such a wonderful athlete.

123
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:29,502
- Are his folks nice?
- You'll love them.

124
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:32,478
We're going down to D.C. Tonight
to be with them Christmas morning.

125
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:36,744
- How did it happen?
- Well, it's silly, really.

126
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:39,752
I'd seen him at the office.
Obviously, I'd seen him.

127
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,754
He's the associate publisher.

128
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:45,690
One day we both ordered sandwiches
from the <i>same</i> place.

129
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,991
He got my lettuce and tomato on wheat,
which, of course, he was allergic to.

130
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:52,328
And I got his lettuce
and tomato on white.

131
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,799
- How amazing.
- It is, isn't it?

132
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:57,030
You make a million decisions
that mean nothing.

133
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:59,800
Then one day you order takeout,
and it changes your life.

134
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:02,001
Destiny takes a hand.

135
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:04,704
Mom, destiny is
something we've invented...

136
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:08,578
because we can't stand the fact that
everything that happens is accidental.

137
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,951
How do you explain that you both ordered
the same sandwich except for the bread?

138
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:17,422
How many people in this world
like lettuce and tomato...

139
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,426
without something else like tuna?

140
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:25,227
Well, it wasn't a sign.
It was a coincidence.

141
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:29,395
I was in Atlantic City with my family.
Cliff was a waiter.

142
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:34,203
He wasn't even supposed to work
that night, and suppose he hadn't?

143
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:38,041
He asked me to take a midnight walk
on the Steel Pier.

144
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:42,606
I've probably told you this
a million times, but I don't care.

145
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,117
Then he held my hand.

146
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,484
At one point I looked down
and I couldn't tell...

147
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:50,820
which fingers were his
and which were mine.

148
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:53,724
And I knew.

149
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:57,252
- What?
- You know.

150
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:00,698
- What?
- Magic.

151
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:03,430
It was magic.

152
00:11:03,504 --> 00:11:05,028
Magic?

153
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:09,303
I knew we'd be together forever and
that everything would be wonderful...

154
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:12,140
just the way you feel about Walter.

155
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:17,276
Walter? It's quite
a formal name, isn't it?

156
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:20,843
One of the things I truly knew
was that your father and I...

157
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,651
were going to have
a wonderful time in...

158
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,057
- The sack, I believe you call it.
- Mom!

159
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:29,425
Of course, it took
several years before everything...

160
00:11:29,496 --> 00:11:31,430
worked like clockwork
in that department.

161
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:33,523
So don't be worried
if it takes a while.

162
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:37,059
- Well, we already...
- Fine. Fine. Fiddle-de-dee.

163
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:40,197
- How's it working?
- Like clockwork.

164
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:43,500
Oh, honey.

165
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,278
- It's a sign.
- You <i>don't</i> believe in signs.

166
00:11:55,923 --> 00:12:00,553
They loved you! I told you they
would love you, and they loved you!

167
00:12:00,628 --> 00:12:03,358
- I love you.
- I love you, Walter.

168
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,891
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?

169
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:11,301
Nope.

170
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:13,363
Not even when you were young?

171
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,704
Nope, not even when I was young.

172
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:19,537
You sure you don't
want to drive with me?

173
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,480
How will I get back
to Baltimore on Friday?

174
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:26,986
I forgot the present. I left your
stepmother's present inside by accident.

175
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:30,285
When we're old and gray, you're gonna
have to remind me to put my teeth in.

176
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:35,021
I'll be walking all over town, smacking
my gums together and not even noticing.

177
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:38,189
- I'll wait.
- You'll wait? Oh! Right.

178
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:41,359
Don't wait. It's silly.
Go ahead. We're late anyway.

179
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:43,630
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

180
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:46,998
<i>Sleigh bells jing-a-ling</i>
<i>Ring-ting-ting-a-ling too</i>

181
00:12:47,074 --> 00:12:49,008
<i>Horses, horses, horses</i>

182
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:51,044
<i>It's lovely weather</i>
<i>for a sleigh ride together with you</i>

183
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:53,045
<i>Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap</i>

184
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:56,173
<i>The snow is falling</i>
<i>and friends are calling, Yoo-hoo</i>

185
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,447
<i>Friends are calling, Yoo-hoo</i>
<i>Ding-a-ling-a-ling</i>

186
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,182
<i>Horses, horses, horses</i>
<i>Horses, horses, horses</i>

187
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:03,848
<i>Horses, horses, horses</i>

188
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:07,587
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

189
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:11,757
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride</i>
<i>in a one-horse open sleigh</i>

190
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,823
<i>Jingle bells</i>

191
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:16,267
- <i>Horses, horses, horses</i>
- <i>Welcome to ""You and Your Emotions. "

192
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,305
- <i>Laughing all the way</i>
<i>- I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone....</i>

193
00:13:18,372 --> 00:13:23,139
<i>broadcasting live across America from</i>
<i>the top of the Sears Tower in Chicago.</i>

194
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,010
<i>Tonight we're talking</i>
<i>about wishes and dreams.</i>

195
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:29,675
- <i>What's your wish this Christmas Eve?</i>
- What's your wish?

196
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,447
- <i>Maybe the best gift you can give your...</i>
- My wish is to turn the radio station.

197
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,388
<i>Subject of this evening's medical update</i>
<i>is "You and Your Spleen."</i>

198
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,119
- <i>Your host is--</i>
- Not on your life.

199
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:43,823
<i>Coming up, "Jingle Bells" backwards,</i>
<i>sung by the New Jersey...</i>

200
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:48,163
- <i>Seattle, go ahead.</i>
- <i>Hello, this is Jonah...</i>

201
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:49,827
<i>No last names, Jonah.</i>

202
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:53,236
<i>You sound younger than</i>
<i>our usual callers. How old are you?</i>

203
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:56,174
- <i>I'm eight.</i>
<i>- Eight. How come you're up so late?</i>

204
00:13:56,243 --> 00:14:00,009
- <i>It's not that late in Seattle.</i>
- <i>Of course. You're absolutely right.</i>

205
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,310
<i>What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?</i>

206
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:06,342
<i>It's not for me. It's for my dad.</i>
<i>I think he needs a new wife.</i>

207
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,184
- <i>You don't like the one he has now?</i>
- <i>He doesn't have one now.</i>

208
00:14:09,256 --> 00:14:10,848
<i>That's the problem.</i>

209
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:13,392
- <i>Where's your mom?</i>
- <i>She died.</i>

210
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,261
- <i>I'm so sorry to hear that.</i>
- Well, who can believe this?

211
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:21,358
<i>I've been pretty sad,</i>
<i>but I think my dad's worse.</i>

212
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:23,995
<i>Have you talked</i>
<i>to your dad about this?</i>

213
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,266
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>Why not?</i>

214
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,901
<i>- It's like it makes him sadder.</i>
- <i>I can understand that.</i>

215
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:32,571
- <i>Jonah, is your dad home right now?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

216
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:36,309
- <i>What's he doing? Is he busy?</i>
- <i>Not really. He's out on the deck.</i>

217
00:14:36,383 --> 00:14:40,615
<i>I'm sure that I can help, but I'm</i>
<i>going to need you to help me help him.</i>

218
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:42,814
- Wretched woman!
- <i>Bring your dad to the phone.</i>

219
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,451
- Hang up, Jonah! Don't listen to her.
- <i>No way. He'd kill</i> me.

220
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,087
<i>Trust me, Jonah.</i>
<i>He won't be angry...</i>

221
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:51,688
<i>when he realizes</i>
<i>how concerned you</i> are <i>about him.</i>

222
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,198
Wanna bet?

223
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,134
<i>If I get yelled at, I'm never</i>
<i>going to listen to your show again.</i>

224
00:14:56,203 --> 00:14:58,501
<i>Fair enough.</i>

225
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,137
- Dad?
- Yeah?

226
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:05,406
There's someone
on the phone for you.

227
00:15:07,381 --> 00:15:10,509
- His name's Sam.
- <i>Sam.</i>

228
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:13,519
<i>If you've just tuned in,</i>
<i>this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.</i>

229
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:15,646
<i>Tonight's topic is</i>
<i>"Your Wishes and Dreams."</i>

230
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:19,488
- I got it.
- <i>We're on the line with Seattle.</i>

231
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,084
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Sam.</i>

232
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:23,891
<i>This is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone</i>
<i>on Network America.</i>

233
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:29,334
What are you selling tonight?
Micro hibachis or Ginza knives?

234
00:15:29,403 --> 00:15:32,668
<i>I'm not selling anything.</i>
<i>I just want to help.</i>

235
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:34,673
<i>I want you to know</i>
<i>that your son called...</i>

236
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:38,677
<i>and he asked me for advice</i>
<i>on how you might find a new wife.</i>

237
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:44,115
- Who is this?
- <i>Dr. Fieldstone of Network America.</i>

238
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:47,119
- <i>You are on the air.</i>
- You called a radio station?

239
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:51,954
- <i>Sam? Sam? Sam, are you with me?</i>
- Yeah. Yes.

240
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:56,257
<i>Your son feels that since your wife's</i>
<i>death you've been very, very unhappy.</i>

241
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,891
<i>He's genuinely worried about you.</i>

242
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:02,401
Oh, hey, get out here.
Get out here.

243
00:16:02,469 --> 00:16:04,801
I'm not gonna
go through this alone.

244
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:08,933
<i>I think it's very hard for him</i>
<i>to talk to you about all this.</i>

245
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,740
<i>I thought maybe you and I could talk.</i>
<i>It would make Jonah feel better.</i>

246
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:16,305
- <i>Sam?</i>
- Talk to her, Dad. She's a doctor.

247
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,318
Of what?
Her first name could be Doctor.

248
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:21,911
- Please?
- <i>Sam?</i>

249
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:25,516
<i>Sam, it's his Christmas wish.</i>

250
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:29,391
- Okay.
- <i>Okay, good.</i>

251
00:16:29,463 --> 00:16:31,988
<i>I know this is difficult.</i>

252
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:35,091
<i>But how long ago</i>
<i>did your wife die?</i>

253
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:37,664
About a year and a half ago.

254
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:40,798
<i>Have you had</i>
<i>any relationships since?</i>

255
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:44,967
- Nope.
- <i>No?</i>

256
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,842
<i>Why not?</i>

257
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:51,642
Marcia... Or should
I call you Dr. Fieldstone?

258
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:54,209
- <i>Dr. Marcia.</i>
- Dr. Marcia.

259
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:58,657
<i>- I don't mean to be rude.</i>
- <i>I don't want to invade your privacy.</i>

260
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:01,057
- Oh, sure you do.
<i>- Sure you do.</i>

261
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:04,427
<i>Go on, Sam.</i>
<i>I'm listening.</i>

262
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:06,363
<i>Sam?</i>

263
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,929
We had a pretty
tough time there at first.

264
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:14,633
But we're dealing with it.

265
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:19,702
And Jonah and I will
get along just fine again...

266
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,840
as soon as I break his radio.

267
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,344
<i>I have no doubt that</i>
<i>you're a wonderful father.</i>

268
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:31,187
<i>- You can tell a lot from a voice.</i>
- You certainly can.

269
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:35,922
<i>But something must be missing if</i>
<i>Jonah still feels you're under a cloud.</i>

270
00:17:35,996 --> 00:17:39,329
<i>Just a few questions.</i>
<i>Are you sleeping at night?</i>

271
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:42,493
- He doesn't sleep at all.
- How do you know that?

272
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,332
I live here.

273
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:51,399
Look, it's Christmas.

274
00:17:54,715 --> 00:17:58,811
Maggie, my wife...

275
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:01,376
She really did it.

276
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,389
I mean, she loved...

277
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:06,916
She made everything beautiful.

278
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:12,892
<i>And it's just tough</i>
<i>this time of year.</i>

279
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,661
Any kid needs a mother.

280
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:19,536
<i>Could it be that you need someone</i>
<i>just as much as Jonah does?</i>

281
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:23,808
Yes.

282
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:27,244
<i>Don't answer that. Let's get into that</i>
<i>right after these messages.</i>

283
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,578
<i>Sam, Jonah, don't go away.</i>

284
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,950
<i>If you've just tuned in,</i>
<i>we're talking to Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

285
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:38,117
<i>We'll be right back after this break</i>
<i>with your listener response.</i>

286
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:40,022
What's she talking about?

287
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:43,187
This is when other people get to call in
and dump on what you said.

288
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:48,792
Oh, oh. This is really fun,
and helpful.

289
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:57,005
I'll bet he's tall
with a cute butt.

290
00:18:57,077 --> 00:18:59,443
Bet he hasn't bathed in weeks
and he stinks.

291
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,879
Harriet, shut up.
Hi. Can I help you?

292
00:19:01,948 --> 00:19:03,711
Tea with the bag out.

293
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:07,743
Maybe I'll hustle myself out to Seattle.
Give him a gift for New Year's Eve.

294
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:11,154
You go on out there if you want to,
but don't open his refrigerator.

295
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:14,125
They don't cover anything
when they put it in the fridge.

296
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,719
They just stick it in there and
leave it till it walks out by itself.

297
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:20,324
What I'm saying is, I wouldn't kick this
guy out of my bed for eating crackers.

298
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,334
You know what I'm saying?
Sixty-five cents.

299
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:26,065
<i>Let's take a call</i>
<i>before we get back to Sleepless.</i>

300
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,267
<i>Knoxville, Tennessee,</i>
<i>you're on the air. Talk to me.</i>

301
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:34,075
<i>Yes, I would just like to know</i>
<i>where I could get this man's address.</i>

302
00:19:34,147 --> 00:19:36,342
- Honey, get in line.
- <i>We don't give that information.</i>

303
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,077
<i>Next caller, go ahead.</i>

304
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:42,680
<i>If there was one question</i>
<i>I was allowed to ask...</i>

305
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:44,986
Oh, go ahead.

306
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:49,154
<i>People who truly loved once</i>
<i>are far more likely to love again.</i>

307
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:53,632
<i>Do you think there's someone out there</i>
<i>you could love as much as your wife?</i>

308
00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:00,567
Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
<i>that's</i> hard to imagine.

309
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,007
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

310
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:09,105
Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning...

311
00:20:09,182 --> 00:20:11,446
breathe in and out all day long.

312
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:16,387
<i>Then after a while</i>
<i>I won't have to remind myself...</i>

313
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:20,620
<i>to get out of bed in the morning</i>
<i>and breathe in and out.</i>

314
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:26,558
And then after a while
I won't have to think about how...

315
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:29,796
I had it great and perfect
for a while.

316
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,637
<i>Sam, tell me what was</i>
<i>so special about your wife?</i>

317
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,302
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>

318
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:42,875
<i>Oh, well, it was</i> a...

319
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:44,883
<i>It was a million</i>
<i>tiny little things.</i>

320
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:50,014
<i>When you added them all up, it just</i>
<i>meant we were supposed to be together.</i>

321
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,220
<i>And I knew it. I knew it</i>
<i>the very first time I touched her.</i>

322
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,263
It was like coming home...

323
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,493
only to no home I'd ever known.

324
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:03,593
I was just taking her hand...

325
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,003
to help her out of a car...

326
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:08,597
and I knew it.

327
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:12,276
<i>It was</i> like...

328
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:14,939
- Magic.
- <i>Magic.</i>

329
00:21:15,015 --> 00:21:18,644
<i>Well, folks,</i>
<i>it's time to wrap it up.</i>

330
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:21,346
<i>I'm Dr. Marcia Fieldstone</i>
<i>in Chicago.</i>

331
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:25,915
<i>And to all my listeners,</i>
<i>a magical and merry Christmas.</i>

332
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:30,929
<i>And to you, Sleepless in Seattle,</i>
<i>we hope you'll call again soon.</i>

333
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:34,228
- <i>Let us know how it's going.</i>
<i>- Oh, you can count on it.</i>

334
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:39,898
<i>When you find me</i>

335
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:44,569
<i>I know somewhere</i>

336
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:50,105
<i>Over the rainbow</i>

337
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:56,755
<i>The bluebirds glide</i>

338
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,662
<i>Birds fly</i>

339
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:09,065
<i>Over the rainbow</i>

340
00:22:09,135 --> 00:22:14,402
<i>Why, then, oh, why</i>

341
00:22:14,474 --> 00:22:18,808
<i>Can't I

342
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:27,076
This man sells the greatest soup
you've ever eaten...

343
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:29,314
and he is the meanest man
in America.

344
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:33,018
I feel very strongly about this, Becky.
It's not just about the soup.

345
00:22:33,093 --> 00:22:35,220
- Do it. What else?
- New Year's Eve.

346
00:22:35,295 --> 00:22:37,763
- Please <i>don't</i> make me write it.
- Listen to this.

347
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:40,959
"Phone service in the greater Chicago
area was tied up for two hours...

348
00:22:41,034 --> 00:22:43,525
Christmas Eve when some kid
calls a phone-in radio show...

349
00:22:43,603 --> 00:22:45,537
and says that his dad
needs a new wife.

350
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:50,042
Two thousand women called the station
asking for the guy's number."

351
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,375
I heard it. This kid calls up
and says, "My dad needs a wife."

352
00:22:53,446 --> 00:22:57,041
This shrink forces the guy to the phone
and says, You want to talk about it?"

353
00:22:57,117 --> 00:22:59,642
He says, No,
as a matter of fact, I don't."

354
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:02,779
Suddenly, for no reason at all, he talks
about how much he loved his wife...

355
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:04,847
and how he just
fell in love with her...

356
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,893
like he was one
of those cows in Michigan.

357
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,054
- What cows in Michigan?
- It was on <i>60 Minutes.</i>

358
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,291
There were those cows
that got zapped by stray voltage.

359
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:15,027
No one knows why.
Maybe it was Wisconsin.

360
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:19,401
But anyway, I was listening to him
talk about how much he loved his wife...

361
00:23:19,472 --> 00:23:21,906
and suddenly I was crying.

362
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:24,239
It's like what happens when
I watch those phone company ads.

363
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:26,336
I don't have to see the whole thing,
just the part where...

364
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:29,382
the daughter gives the mother the
refrigerator with the big red bow on it.

365
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:33,579
The Polaroid commercial. Two 5-year-olds
at their grandfather's birthday party.

366
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:35,587
- They're making the album.
- With the glue.

367
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:38,351
That kills me.

368
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:40,859
You should write
something about this.

369
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:43,452
- About what?
- Whatever it is.

370
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,296
I'll tell you. Two thousand women
calling a radio station for a husband.

371
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:49,301
There are a lot of desperate women
out there lookin' for love.

372
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:51,303
Especially over a certain age.

373
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:54,602
It's easier to be killed by a terrorist
than get married over the age of 40.

374
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:56,608
That is not true.
That statistic is not true.

375
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:58,837
That's right. It's not true.
But it feels true.

376
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:00,846
It feels true
because it is true.

377
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:03,576
There's practically a whole book
about how that's not true.

378
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,676
- Calm down. You brought it up.
- I did not, Wyatt.

379
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:09,950
- Did you even read that book?
- Did anyone read it all the way through?

380
00:24:10,023 --> 00:24:13,117
Are you two finished?
Fine. Now where were we?

381
00:24:13,193 --> 00:24:17,357
If someone is a widower,
why do they say that he was widowed?

382
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,194
Why don't they say
he was widowered?

383
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,804
I was just wondering.

384
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:26,862
What was that about up there?

385
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,841
- What was what?
- What's with you?

386
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:33,709
- Nothing's with me.
- Something's with you.

387
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,272
- What are you saying?
- Whatever it is, you can tell me.

388
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,840
Sleepless in Seattle?

389
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:41,580
That's what she called him on the show
because he can't sleep.

390
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:44,748
And now 2,000 women
want his number.

391
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:47,258
The guy could be a crackhead,
a transvestite...

392
00:24:47,327 --> 00:24:50,592
a flasher, a junkie,
a chain-saw murderer...

393
00:24:50,663 --> 00:24:53,791
or someone really sick,
someone like my Rick.

394
00:24:55,635 --> 00:24:58,570
- Actually, he sounded nice.
- Oh?

395
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:04,005
Oh, really?
Now we're getting down to it.

396
00:25:04,077 --> 00:25:07,012
Please. Becky,
I'm madly in love with Walter.

397
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,277
He did the craziest thing
the other night. What was that?

398
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:16,285
Oh, it was so funny.
We were hysterical. What was that?

399
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:33,138
You know, I've got to go to Boston
for the convention, right?

400
00:25:33,206 --> 00:25:36,437
Then I got to visit Winston-Hughes
about switching over our computers.

401
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:41,970
But why don't we meet in New York
for <i>Valentine's</i> Day weekend?

402
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:45,176
Walter, I'd love to!

403
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:47,947
We can stay at the Plaza.

404
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:50,421
Ice-stake in Central Park.

405
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,754
Register.

406
00:25:52,826 --> 00:25:54,555
Register?

407
00:25:54,627 --> 00:25:59,257
You know, for dishes,
glasses, silver, everything.

408
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:03,234
How about it?

409
00:26:06,473 --> 00:26:09,374
I'll take you to Chinatown
for dim sum.

410
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:12,411
- Does it have wheat in it?
- I don't think so.

411
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:18,909
<i>Dim sum, dim sum</i>

412
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:25,749
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

413
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:30,159
five, four, three, two, one!

414
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,860
Hey, Jonah. Wake up. Wake up, man.
The ball's droppin'.

415
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:36,492
<i>Happy new year!</i>

416
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,338
<i>Okay, pal. I got ya.

417
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:47,674
It's okay.

418
00:26:47,747 --> 00:26:49,772
There we go.

419
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:25,510
Happy new year.

420
00:27:25,585 --> 00:27:27,576
Happy new year.

421
00:27:30,757 --> 00:27:33,089
Kiss Howard.

422
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:35,252
Good night, Howard.

423
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:54,777
<i>Sometimes I wonder</i>

424
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:58,010
<i>Why I spend</i>

425
00:27:58,084 --> 00:28:02,418
<i>The lonely night</i>

426
00:28:02,488 --> 00:28:05,980
<i>Dreaming of a song</i>

427
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,653
<i>The melody</i>

428
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:12,323
<i>Haunts my reverie</i>

429
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:17,631
<i>And I am once again with you</i>

430
00:28:17,704 --> 00:28:21,265
<i>When our love was new</i>

431
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:27,035
<i>And each kiss an inspiration</i>

432
00:28:30,516 --> 00:28:34,213
<i>But that was long ago</i>

433
00:28:34,287 --> 00:28:38,223
<i>Now my consolation</i>

434
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:43,194
<i>Is in the stardust of a song</i>

435
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:48,860
<i>Beside the garden wall</i>

436
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:53,269
<i>When stars are bright</i>

437
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:56,866
<i>You are in my arms</i>

438
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,844
<i>The nightingale</i>

439
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:03,279
<i>Tells his fairy tale</i>

440
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:07,342
<i>Of paradise where roses bloom</i>

441
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,513
Can I have half your beer?

442
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,785
Sure. Go ahead.

443
00:29:15,028 --> 00:29:18,054
What did I used to say?

444
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,292
"Here's looking at you"?

445
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:22,300
"Here's mud in your eye"?

446
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:24,700
"Here's to us."

447
00:29:25,872 --> 00:29:29,103
You used to say, Here's to us."

448
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:36,945
Oh, babe.
I miss you so much it hurts.

449
00:29:54,434 --> 00:29:56,459
- What do you want to do?
- We'll tell him when he gets here.

450
00:29:56,536 --> 00:29:58,800
You want to tell him.
I don't mind telling him.

451
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:01,601
- She's here.
- She's back. She has another idea.

452
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,642
I don't need...
Claire, how are you?

453
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,338
I'm so glad you're here.
I heard you on the radio.

454
00:30:06,412 --> 00:30:09,939
- I told everyone about it.
- We already knew.

455
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,278
- How did you...
- Grace.

456
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,512
The dispatcher?
All of Seattle knows.

457
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:16,020
I was brushing my teeth
and suddenly there you were.

458
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:19,183
I couldn't believe my ears.
I called my mother in Las Vegas.

459
00:30:19,258 --> 00:30:24,093
I said, Mother, turn on the radio.
That's my architect."

460
00:30:24,163 --> 00:30:26,996
It is so nice...

461
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:30,467
when a man
can express his feelings.

462
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:33,437
- It's wonderful.
- I wish I could express my feelings.

463
00:30:33,506 --> 00:30:38,739
- So, Claire, is there a problem?
- I was tossing and turning last night.

464
00:30:38,811 --> 00:30:44,113
I realized I'm never going to fit my
platters in the refrigerator we ordered.

465
00:30:44,183 --> 00:30:46,583
When I give parties,
I always put in platters.

466
00:30:46,652 --> 00:30:50,019
So I thought I would get the Sub-Zero
refrigerator instead. The only problem...

467
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,023
We have to redo all the cabinets.

468
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:55,492
- We'll be into this wall.
- That's a bearing wall.

469
00:30:55,561 --> 00:30:57,893
That's a delay, Claire, of...

470
00:30:57,964 --> 00:30:59,898
- Two, three...
- Five, six...

471
00:30:59,966 --> 00:31:01,934
- Twelve weeks.
- I don't mind.

472
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:04,492
The important thing
is to get it right.

473
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,538
- Absolutely.
- Your words.

474
00:31:06,606 --> 00:31:09,336
I've got to rush.
<i>La decorateur</i> calls.

475
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,604
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

476
00:31:15,148 --> 00:31:17,480
Well, this is fate.
She's divorced.

477
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,711
We don't want to redo the cabinets,
and you need a wife.

478
00:31:19,786 --> 00:31:22,448
What do they call that
when everything intersects?

479
00:31:22,522 --> 00:31:24,490
The Bermuda Triangle.

480
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:37,762
And here's another one.
You got room for one more here?

481
00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:39,828
There you go.
You all right there?

482
00:31:39,906 --> 00:31:43,865
- Look at this, Dad. They're all for you.
- Yes, sir. There you go.

483
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,942
"Sleepless in Seattle.
In care of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"?

484
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:54,749
If you have trouble sleeping, drink
a glass of water from the other side.

485
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:57,312
- I thought that was for hiccups.
- Does it work for hiccups?

486
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,087
For hiccups, take a spoonful of sugar
and hold it in your mouth for a minute.

487
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,028
- Really?
- Thank you.

488
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:07,395
What possessed you
to give them our address?

489
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,561
They called and asked for it.

490
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:12,797
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle...

491
00:32:12,872 --> 00:32:16,672
You're the most attractive man
I ever laid ears on."

492
00:32:16,742 --> 00:32:20,405
Wait, wait, wait. They called?
How did they get our number?

493
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,573
Let me guess.
You gave it to them.

494
00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:25,708
You have to give them your phone number,
or they won't let you on the air.

495
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:28,686
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle,
I live in Tulsa."

496
00:32:28,754 --> 00:32:32,212
- <i>Where's</i> that?
- It's in Oklahoma.

497
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:35,021
- Do you know where Oklahoma is?
- Somewhere in the middle.

498
00:32:35,094 --> 00:32:38,325
I'm not even gonna think about
what they're not teaching you in school.

499
00:32:38,397 --> 00:32:40,865
Yeah, it's somewhere
in the middle.

500
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:46,064
Generally speaking, we should rule out
anyone that doesn't live near here.

501
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:47,935
She's willing to fly anywhere.

502
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:53,244
She looks like my third grade teacher.
I hated my third grade teacher.

503
00:32:53,312 --> 00:32:57,373
Wait a minute.
She is my third grade teacher!

504
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,217
- Aren't you gonna read any of these?
- This is not how it's done.

505
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:05,621
I'd much rather
just see somebody I like...

506
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:09,024
and get a feeling about them...

507
00:33:09,095 --> 00:33:11,256
and ask them
if they want to have a drink.

508
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,264
- Or a slice of pizza?
- Not dinner.

509
00:33:13,332 --> 00:33:15,459
Not necessarily on the first date.

510
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,969
Halfway through dinner you could be
really sorry you asked them to dinner.

511
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,028
Whereas, if it's just a drink...

512
00:33:20,106 --> 00:33:22,631
if you like them,
you could always ask them to dinner.

513
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,268
But if not, you can just say,
Well, that was great."

514
00:33:25,344 --> 00:33:29,838
And then you go home.
See what I mean?

515
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:32,111
I wonder if
it still works this way.

516
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:36,484
- It doesn't. They ask you.
- I'm starting to notice that.

517
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:41,152
If you get a new wife, I guess
you'll have <i>sex</i> with her, huh?

518
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,718
I certainly hope so.

519
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:48,233
- Will she scratch up your back?
- What?

520
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:53,068
In movies, women are always scratching
up the man's back and screaming.

521
00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:56,040
- How do you know this?
- Jed's got cable.

522
00:33:56,108 --> 00:33:58,303
Oh, Jed's got cable.

523
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:02,876
Hand me that towel
behind you, please.

524
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,511
- Thank you.
- I need it too.

525
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,320
Here. Let me get you.
Jed's got cable.

526
00:34:13,392 --> 00:34:15,986
<i>Another bride</i>

527
00:34:16,062 --> 00:34:18,690
<i>Another groom</i>

528
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:24,168
<i>Another sunny honeymoon</i>

529
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:27,000
<i>Another season</i>

530
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:31,703
<i>And that's the reason</i>
<i>for makin' whoopee</i>

531
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:51,729
<i>When the sun is high</i>
<i>in the afternoon sky</i>

532
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:56,166
<i>You can always</i>
<i>find something to do</i>

533
00:34:56,235 --> 00:35:02,140
<i>But from dusk till dawn</i>
<i>as the clock ticks on</i>

534
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:08,977
<i>Something happens to you</i>

535
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:13,576
<i>In the</i> wee <i>small hours</i>

536
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,282
<i>Of the morning</i>

537
00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:21,019
<i>While the whole wide world</i>

538
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:25,189
<i>Is fast asleep</i>

539
00:35:25,264 --> 00:35:29,098
<i>You lie awake</i>

540
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:33,195
<i>And think about the boy</i>

541
00:35:33,272 --> 00:35:36,105
<i>And never ever think</i>

542
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:41,374
<i>Of counting sheep</i>

543
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:43,972
<i>Welcome back to</i>
<i>the ""Best of Dr. Marcia Fieldstone"...</i>

544
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,814
<i>clinical psychologist</i>
<i>and the friend you never had.</i>

545
00:35:46,886 --> 00:35:50,913
<i>- Remember Marooned in Miami?</i>
- <i>He says he doesn't love me anymore.</i>

546
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,925
<i>Why would you want to be</i>
<i>with someone who doesn't love you?</i>

547
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:55,984
<i>Disappointed in Denver.</i>

548
00:35:56,062 --> 00:36:00,158
<i>Every time I come close to orgasm,</i>
<i>he goes to make himself a sandwich.</i>

549
00:36:00,232 --> 00:36:02,359
<i>Why don't you make him</i>
<i>a sandwich beforehand?</i>

550
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:04,369
<i>Sleepless in Seattle.</i>

551
00:36:04,437 --> 00:36:09,807
<i>Well, I'm going to get</i>
<i>out of bed every morning....</i>

552
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:13,675
<i>and breathe in and out all day long.</i>

553
00:36:13,746 --> 00:36:18,115
<i>Then after a while</i>
<i>I won't have to remind myself....</i>

554
00:36:18,184 --> 00:36:22,951
<i>to get out of bed in the morning</i>
<i>and breathe in and out.</i>

555
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:29,927
<i>And then after a while</i>
<i>I won't have to think about how...</i>

556
00:36:29,995 --> 00:36:33,954
<i>I had it great and perfect</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

557
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:38,732
<i>Sam, tell me what was</i>
<i>so special about your wife?</i>

558
00:36:38,804 --> 00:36:41,773
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>

559
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:47,106
<i>Oh, well, it was</i> a...

560
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:49,147
<i>It was a million</i>
<i>tiny little things.</i>

561
00:36:49,215 --> 00:36:54,175
<i>When you added them all up, it just</i>
<i>meant we were supposed to be together.</i>

562
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:58,917
<i>And I knew it. I knew it</i>
<i>the very first time I touched her.</i>

563
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:01,357
<i>It was like coming</i> home...

564
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,624
<i>only to no home I'd ever known.</i>

565
00:37:04,697 --> 00:37:07,723
<i>I was just taking her hand...</i>

566
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,496
<i>to help her out of a car...</i>

567
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,800
<i>and I knew it.</i>

568
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:16,569
<i>It was like....</i>

569
00:37:16,642 --> 00:37:18,576
<i>magic.</i>

570
00:37:40,065 --> 00:37:43,967
I think I'm going crazy, Dennis.
Are you happily married?

571
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:47,005
- What?
- I mean, why did you get married?

572
00:37:47,072 --> 00:37:49,438
Was it all trumpets
and fireworks?

573
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:52,671
I got married because Betsy said
we had to break up or get married...

574
00:37:52,745 --> 00:37:54,440
so we got married.

575
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,941
But when you first met her...

576
00:37:57,016 --> 00:37:59,541
did you believe
she was the only person for you?

577
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:02,781
That in some mystical,
cosmic way it was fated?

578
00:38:02,855 --> 00:38:06,723
Annie, when you're
attracted to someone...

579
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:09,693
it just means that your subconscious
is attracted to their subconscious...

580
00:38:09,762 --> 00:38:11,627
subconsciously.

581
00:38:11,697 --> 00:38:15,428
What we think of as fate is two neuroses
knowing they're a perfect match.

582
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:18,770
I don't even know him.

583
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:23,673
I am having all of these fantasies
about some man I have never even met...

584
00:38:23,742 --> 00:38:25,767
who lives in Seattle!

585
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,938
It rains nine months
of the year in Seattle.

586
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:32,973
I know! I know!
I do not want to move to Seattle.

587
00:38:35,821 --> 00:38:39,348
But what I really don't want
to do is end up always wondering...

588
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:42,724
what might have happened
and knowing I could have done something.

589
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:45,025
What do you think?

590
00:38:45,097 --> 00:38:47,031
It's just cold feet, isn't it?

591
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:50,159
Everybody panics before
they get married. Didn't you?

592
00:38:51,036 --> 00:38:52,901
- I did.
- You did.

593
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:56,339
Thank you very much, Dennis. I feel so
much better just having blown this off.

594
00:38:56,408 --> 00:38:57,739
Anytime.

595
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:01,678
Sandy has a girlfriend, Glenda.
She's a weight lifter.

596
00:39:01,747 --> 00:39:03,772
It's not like her neck
is bigger than her head.

597
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:07,876
I'm not asking you to set me up.
I don't need your help with that.

598
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:11,047
I just want to know
what it's like out there.

599
00:39:11,123 --> 00:39:13,648
That's what I'm trying to tell you,
what women are lookin' for.

600
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,217
Pecs and a cute butt.

601
00:39:16,295 --> 00:39:18,923
- Like, "He has the cutest <i>butt''?</i>
- Yeah.

602
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:21,865
- Where did I hear that recently?
- Everywhere.

603
00:39:21,934 --> 00:39:24,596
You can't even turn on the news
nowadays without hearing about...

604
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,571
how some babe thought
some guy's butt was cute.

605
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,098
Who the first woman to say this was,
I don't know. But it caught on.

606
00:39:31,176 --> 00:39:33,337
So how's my butt?

607
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:37,912
- Not bad.
- Really?

608
00:39:37,983 --> 00:39:39,974
- Is it cute though?
- I don't know.

609
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:42,043
Are we grading on a curve?

610
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:44,646
When's the last time
you were out there?

611
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:50,829
Jimmy Carter, 1978.

612
00:39:52,865 --> 00:39:55,197
Things are
a little different now.

613
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:58,668
First you have to be friends.
You have to like each other.

614
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:02,605
Then you neck.
This could go on for years.

615
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:05,269
Then you have tests.
Then you get to do it with a condom.

616
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:07,505
The good news is,
you split the check.

617
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,074
I don't think I could
let a woman pay for dinner.

618
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,550
Great. They'll throw
a parade in your honor.

619
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:18,113
You'll be man of the year
in <i>Seattle</i> magazine.

620
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,055
Tiramisu.

621
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:23,026
- What is tiramisu?
- You'll find out.

622
00:40:23,095 --> 00:40:24,756
- What is it?
- You'll see.

623
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,731
Some woman will want me to do it to her.
I'm not going to know what it is.

624
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,233
You'll love it.

625
00:40:30,202 --> 00:40:32,830
This is going to be tough.
Tough, tough.

626
00:40:32,905 --> 00:40:34,998
This is going to be much tougher
than I thought it was going to be.

627
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:38,441
How about that decorator
on the Bennett job?

628
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,946
- Victoria?
- Yeah, she's perk.

629
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:44,141
- No, I don't...
- Come on!

630
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:45,877
I'm far away from that.

631
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:48,283
- I'm just assembling notes.
- Notes.

632
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:51,016
- How would I do that?
- What do you mean? Call her up.

633
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,149
You say, "Let's get together.
We'll look at swatches."

634
00:40:53,225 --> 00:40:56,058
Call her on the phone?
Say, "Let's look at swatches"?

635
00:40:56,128 --> 00:40:58,926
- Color schemes.
- She's not gonna see through that?

636
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,933
You don't do it like I do it.
You do it in your own suave way.

637
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,663
Think Cary Grant.

638
00:41:04,737 --> 00:41:08,901
Cary Grant would say,
"Come look at my swatches"?

639
00:41:08,974 --> 00:41:12,307
Maybe he did. I know
he didn't do it in the movies.

640
00:41:12,378 --> 00:41:13,936
<i>Gunga Din?</i>

641
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,311
<i>Gunga Din</i> is not
a swatch kind of movie.

642
00:41:16,382 --> 00:41:18,850
Who knows what
he did in real life?

643
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:21,818
But he did that
with Dyan Cannon?

644
00:41:21,887 --> 00:41:24,412
"Hello, Dyan.
Take a look at these swatches."

645
00:41:43,142 --> 00:41:45,542
Jonah, I'm home.

646
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:49,947
Hey, Jonah!

647
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:10,458
Hi, Dad. This is Jessica.

648
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,632
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Jessica.

649
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:19,768
Dad, this is amazing. If you play this
backwards, it says, "Paul is <i>dead.''</i>

650
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:23,177
Yeah, I know.

651
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:25,011
How do you know?

652
00:42:27,352 --> 00:42:29,877
Dad, could you shut the door?

653
00:42:29,955 --> 00:42:32,150
Sure. Sure.

654
00:42:32,224 --> 00:42:33,885
H and G.

655
00:42:35,461 --> 00:42:38,021
Hi and good-bye.

656
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:27,476
<i>I'm back in the saddle again</i>

657
00:43:27,546 --> 00:43:31,312
<i>Out where a friend is a friend</i>

658
00:43:31,383 --> 00:43:36,013
<i>Where the longhorn cattle feed</i>
<i>on the lowly jimsonweed</i>

659
00:43:36,088 --> 00:43:40,115
<i>Back in the saddle again</i>

660
00:43:40,192 --> 00:43:44,424
<i>Ridin' the range once more</i>

661
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:48,398
<i>Totin' my old.44</i>

662
00:43:48,467 --> 00:43:50,662
<i>Where you sleep out every night</i>

663
00:43:50,736 --> 00:43:54,035
Hello, Victoria?

664
00:43:54,106 --> 00:43:58,167
This is Sam Baldwin.
I don't know if you remember me, but...

665
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,105
Oh, great. Hi.

666
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:06,242
I was wondering if...

667
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:10,448
if you would like
to have a drink with me?

668
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:11,955
Dinner?

669
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:16,958
Dinner would be even better.

670
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:20,556
Friday would be great.
Yeah. How...

671
00:44:20,632 --> 00:44:23,100
I hear that's a good place.

672
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:30,338
How... 7:30 would be fine.
And Ill...

673
00:44:32,244 --> 00:44:35,509
Okay, I'll meet you there. Okay.

674
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:39,210
So it's Friday...

675
00:44:39,284 --> 00:44:41,582
at 7:30 for dinner.

676
00:44:41,653 --> 00:44:43,086
Great.

677
00:44:44,656 --> 00:44:46,248
Me too. Bye.

678
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:51,285
<i>Back in the saddle again</i>

679
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:55,595
<i>Are you in love with him?</i>

680
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,001
<i>I'm not now.</i>

681
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:04,935
Now those were the days
when people knew how to be in love.

682
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:07,137
- You're a basket case.
- They knew it.

683
00:45:07,212 --> 00:45:12,445
Time, distance, nothing could separate
them, because they knew it was right.

684
00:45:12,517 --> 00:45:15,577
- It was real. It was...
- A movie.

685
00:45:15,654 --> 00:45:17,588
That's your problem.
You don't want to be in love.

686
00:45:17,656 --> 00:45:19,817
You want to be
in love in a movie.

687
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:21,483
Read it to me.

688
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:27,323
Dear Sleepless and Son, I have never
written a letter like this in my life."

689
00:45:27,399 --> 00:45:30,891
That's what everyone writes at
the beginning of letters to strangers.

690
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:34,268
I know that.
You think I don't know that?

691
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:37,103
What about Walter?

692
00:45:37,175 --> 00:45:41,168
Walter. Oh, I would
give anything to marry Walter.

693
00:45:41,246 --> 00:45:43,373
He's so unexpected.

694
00:45:43,448 --> 00:45:48,476
You think you can tell what he's like
by just looking at him, but you can't.

695
00:45:48,553 --> 00:45:51,021
I should write something
in this about magic.

696
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:52,716
- What?
- Something.

697
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:56,522
What if I never meet him? What if this
man is my destiny and I never meet him?

698
00:45:56,595 --> 00:45:59,530
Your destiny can be your doom.
Look at me and Rick.

699
00:45:59,598 --> 00:46:01,566
I want to meet you..."

700
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:05,000
<i>- The top of the Empire State Building?</i>
- The top of the Empire State Building.

701
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,867
<i>That's perfect.</i>

702
00:46:06,938 --> 00:46:09,372
Sunset, Valentine's Day.

703
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:14,772
I'll be in New York with Walter.
I can squeeze it in.

704
00:46:14,846 --> 00:46:17,644
I'll be in New York with Walter.

705
00:46:24,423 --> 00:46:26,721
Do you want to
hear about destiny?

706
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:30,694
If I <i>hadn't</i> married Martin, I wouldn't
have had the house with the dead tree.

707
00:46:30,762 --> 00:46:33,196
On account of which,
I got divorced.

708
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:37,065
On account of which, I hit a car
and met Rick while buying a neck brace.

709
00:46:37,135 --> 00:46:41,367
Wait. You never told me you got
a divorce because of a dead tree.

710
00:46:42,307 --> 00:46:43,740
The tree man.

711
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:45,834
You fell in love
with the tree man?

712
00:46:45,911 --> 00:46:48,744
I did not say "love."
Did I say love"?

713
00:46:48,814 --> 00:46:51,214
This is my favorite part.

714
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:55,185
<i>It's now or never.</i>

715
00:46:56,121 --> 00:46:58,385
<i>"Never" is a frightening word.</i>

716
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,489
<i>We'd be fools</i>
<i>to let happiness pass us by.</i>

717
00:47:05,597 --> 00:47:09,294
<i>Winter must be cold</i>
<i>for those with no warm memories.</i>

718
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:14,461
<i>We've already missed the spring.</i>

719
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:19,304
Men never get this movie.

720
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,970
I know.

721
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:25,413
Mommy! Mommy!

722
00:47:28,854 --> 00:47:30,879
It's okay. I'm here.

723
00:47:30,956 --> 00:47:33,356
- Dad!
- I'm comin'.

724
00:47:33,425 --> 00:47:35,518
It's all right. It's okay.

725
00:47:36,962 --> 00:47:40,921
It's all right. It's okay.
What was that about?

726
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:43,229
- It was sinking.
- What was?

727
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:46,634
Our house. There was water
coming in all the windows.

728
00:47:48,273 --> 00:47:50,537
Well, it's okay now.

729
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:55,307
It's all right.
So what should we do?

730
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,814
Your mother used to...

731
00:47:57,883 --> 00:48:00,317
sing to you
when you had bad dreams.

732
00:48:01,453 --> 00:48:03,148
"Bye-Bye, Blackbird."

733
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:08,853
I miss her.

734
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:11,794
What do you think happens
to someone after they die?

735
00:48:13,198 --> 00:48:16,759
- I don't know.
- Like, do you believe in heaven?

736
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:23,167
I never did.

737
00:48:23,241 --> 00:48:26,642
Or the whole idea of an afterlife,
but now I don't know.

738
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,445
'Cause I have
these dreams about...

739
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,149
about your mom.

740
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:39,584
And we have long talks...

741
00:48:39,658 --> 00:48:43,219
about you,
how you're doin'.

742
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:47,026
Which she sort of knows,
but I tell her anyway.

743
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:49,362
So what is that?

744
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,700
It's sort of an afterlife,
isn't it?

745
00:48:54,706 --> 00:48:56,469
I'm starting to forget her.

746
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:16,258
She could peel an apple...

747
00:49:17,596 --> 00:49:20,087
in one long...

748
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,099
curly strip.

749
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:26,030
The whole apple.

750
00:49:26,104 --> 00:49:28,937
<i>Pack up all my cares and woes</i>

751
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,837
<i>Feelin' low</i>

752
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:34,708
<i>Here I go</i>

753
00:49:34,779 --> 00:49:38,772
<i>I say bye- bye</i>

754
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,340
I love you, Jonah.

755
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,753
I love you, Dad.

756
00:49:49,828 --> 00:49:51,762
See you tomorrow.

757
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:58,029
<i>Sugar's sweet</i>
<i>So is she</i>

758
00:49:58,103 --> 00:50:00,571
<i>I say bye</i>

759
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:02,971
<i>Bye</i>

760
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,975
<i>Blackbird</i>

761
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:15,482
<i>No one seems to love</i>

762
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:19,513
<i>Or understand me now</i>

763
00:50:23,194 --> 00:50:26,186
<i>Oh, and hard luck stories</i>

764
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:30,825
<i>They keep handin' me, yeah</i>

765
00:50:34,773 --> 00:50:38,402
<i>Where somebody shines a light</i>

766
00:50:40,545 --> 00:50:44,572
<i>I'm comin' on home tonight now</i>

767
00:50:44,649 --> 00:50:48,244
<i>Oh, Lord</i>
<i>Yeah, darlin'</i>

768
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,757
<i>I wanna say</i>
<i>Bye- bye, blackbird</i>

769
00:50:52,824 --> 00:50:54,758
<i>Lord have mercy</i>

770
00:50:55,894 --> 00:50:57,885
<i>Somebody love me now</i>

771
00:51:05,704 --> 00:51:08,935
Laurie?
Hi, it's Annie.

772
00:51:09,007 --> 00:51:11,066
Fine. I'm fine.

773
00:51:11,142 --> 00:51:14,805
Listen. I'm doing an article
on call-in radio shows.

774
00:51:14,879 --> 00:51:18,576
Do you know anyone who works for
someone named Dr. Marcia Fieldstone?

775
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,847
I'm a writer for the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>
and a friend of Laurie Johnson's.

776
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,616
I'm doing a piece on how
people handle bereavement...

777
00:51:24,689 --> 00:51:28,750
and I understand you had a caller
the other night, some guy from Seattle.

778
00:51:37,035 --> 00:51:40,232
<i>This is Jonah Baldwin. We're not in</i>
<i>right now, but you can leave...</i>

779
00:52:44,669 --> 00:52:46,102
Architect.

780
00:53:20,705 --> 00:53:23,970
Okay, Clarise, I'm gonna be back
either by midnight...

781
00:53:24,042 --> 00:53:26,602
or 8:30, if disaster strikes.

782
00:53:26,678 --> 00:53:28,703
Here's one for both of us.

783
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,476
- "Sleepless and Son, Baltimore."
- I left the restaurant's phone number.

784
00:53:31,549 --> 00:53:34,985
If there's a problem, the pediatrician's
number is right above the phone.

785
00:53:35,053 --> 00:53:39,649
Here's a bottle of ipecac if anybody
drinks poison. By the juice glasses.

786
00:53:39,724 --> 00:53:41,749
- Fine.
- How do I look?

787
00:53:41,826 --> 00:53:44,124
- Great.
- Do I look okay?

788
00:53:44,195 --> 00:53:48,325
Do I look all right? I look stupid.
I look like I'm tryin' too hard.

789
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:50,993
I was gonna get a haircut,
but then I'd look like I got one.

790
00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:54,266
- This is a good letter, Dad.
- The heels on these shoes are grotesque.

791
00:53:54,339 --> 00:53:55,897
Looks like
I'm tryin' to be tall.

792
00:53:55,974 --> 00:53:59,068
Her name is Annie.
Annie Reed.

793
00:53:59,144 --> 00:54:00,611
- Bye.
- Read this!

794
00:54:00,678 --> 00:54:02,270
Read this!

795
00:54:04,482 --> 00:54:08,179
"Dear Sleepless and Son,
I've never written..." Blah, blah.

796
00:54:08,253 --> 00:54:10,847
"I've been an excellent third baseman
for as long as I remember...

797
00:54:10,922 --> 00:54:13,288
and while we're on the subject,
let's just say that...

798
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:15,826
Brooks Robinson
was the best third baseman ever.

799
00:54:15,894 --> 00:54:18,328
It's important you agree with me,
because I'm from Baltimore."

800
00:54:18,396 --> 00:54:20,887
She thinks Brooks Robinson's
the greatest. So do you.

801
00:54:20,965 --> 00:54:23,763
- Everyone thinks he's the greatest.
- It's a sign.

802
00:54:23,835 --> 00:54:25,302
Come here.

803
00:54:26,604 --> 00:54:28,595
I'll show you a sign.
Here's a sign.

804
00:54:28,673 --> 00:54:31,233
All right.

805
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,368
Where is Seattle?
Right.

806
00:54:33,444 --> 00:54:35,708
Where is Baltimore?

807
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,839
It's right there! Look!

808
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:41,511
One, two, three, four... There's like
26 states between here and there.

809
00:54:41,586 --> 00:54:43,053
Now that's a sign.

810
00:54:43,121 --> 00:54:45,749
I'm outta here.
Good-bye. Good night.

811
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,416
I love you.

812
00:54:51,196 --> 00:54:53,460
Clarise, did you move your car?

813
00:55:03,641 --> 00:55:05,905
- Thank you, Derrick.
- You're welcome.

814
00:55:05,977 --> 00:55:07,467
- I'll have...
- White wine?

815
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,780
- And you, sir?
- I'm fine, thank you.

816
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,750
- You look good.
- You look good yourself.

817
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:23,317
- I thought you were never gonna call me.
- You did?

818
00:55:23,394 --> 00:55:26,557
But I really wanted you to,
and I thought you were never going to.

819
00:55:26,631 --> 00:55:28,565
- Excuse me, Mr. Baldwin?
- Yes?

820
00:55:28,633 --> 00:55:30,567
There's a phone call for you.

821
00:55:37,842 --> 00:55:39,275
Thank you.
Hello?

822
00:55:39,344 --> 00:55:42,575
<i>Dad, can we go to New York City</i>
<i>for Valentine's Day?</i>

823
00:55:43,648 --> 00:55:44,910
What?

00:55:44,983 --> 00:55:47,144
<i>Annie Reed from Baltimore</i>
<i>wants to meet us....</i>

825
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:51,552
<i>at the top of the Empire State Building</i>
<i>on Valentine's Day.</i>

826
00:55:51,623 --> 00:55:53,557
- Jonah.
- <i>What?</i>

827
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:56,219
Have you fallen down?
Are you bleeding?

828
00:55:56,294 --> 00:55:59,263
Is Clarise there?
Has she been strangled?

829
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:01,321
So this is the only reason
for this phone call?

830
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,163
<i>If we book now,</i>
<i>we can get an excursion fare.</i>

831
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,829
<i>Jessica's parents are travel agents,</i>
<i>and Jessica says...</i>

832
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,896
I'm not going to have
this conversation now.

833
00:56:08,973 --> 00:56:11,237
We will talk about it
at a later time.

834
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:14,608
I can't believe this conversation
has lasted this long. You go to bed.

835
00:56:22,186 --> 00:56:23,619
Everything all right?

836
00:56:23,688 --> 00:56:25,747
Oh, yeah.
Do you have kids?

837
00:56:25,823 --> 00:56:27,313
- No.
- Want mine?

838
00:56:30,962 --> 00:56:33,226
I will have an Absolut
straight up, please.

839
00:56:33,298 --> 00:56:34,890
Sure.

840
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,518
Put that down! Stop it!

841
00:56:55,586 --> 00:56:58,282
There she is.

842
00:56:58,356 --> 00:57:02,156
- Why is she bringing those groceries?
- She's cooking for us, so be prepared.

843
00:57:02,226 --> 00:57:05,127
Hi, Sam. Thanks.
Thanks.

844
00:57:05,196 --> 00:57:07,926
And let me guess.
You must be Jonah.

845
00:57:11,903 --> 00:57:13,336
- This it?
- Yeah.

846
00:57:13,404 --> 00:57:15,668
- The car's down this way.
- Great.

847
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:19,266
<i>She's on her sixth painter...</i>

848
00:57:19,344 --> 00:57:21,278
and we're never
gonna finish this job.

849
00:57:21,346 --> 00:57:23,371
Now she wants
the fireplace re-bricked.

850
00:57:23,448 --> 00:57:25,746
I know her pretty well.
I could give her a call.

851
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:29,548
I've got it solved. I'm just gonna hit
her with one of those fireplace bricks.

852
00:57:32,857 --> 00:57:35,951
Oh, that is so funny.
You are so funny.

853
00:57:36,027 --> 00:57:38,928
Whenever she wants anything done,
she does this song and dance about...

854
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,261
"I don't know. I'm stupid.
You tell me.

855
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:44,324
You know better than I,
but <i>couldn't</i> we flip the house...

856
00:57:44,402 --> 00:57:48,065
so everything on one side is now on the
other, and the back becomes the front?

857
00:57:48,139 --> 00:57:50,198
Could the whole house
open up on a hinge?

858
00:57:50,274 --> 00:57:53,732
That way I could just get in
with the garage door opener."

859
00:57:53,811 --> 00:57:57,406
I just say, "Yeah, we can do that.
We're just gonna have to... <i>''</i>

860
00:57:57,482 --> 00:58:00,417
Move the kitchen cabinets."

861
00:58:07,558 --> 00:58:09,219
Jonah, bring that stuff.

862
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:12,728
Do you like baseball?

863
00:58:14,132 --> 00:58:16,123
Yes, I do.

864
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,658
My firm has <i>box</i> seats to the Mariners.
Why don't we all go sometime?

865
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:24,307
- What about camping?
- What about it?

866
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,811
- Do you like camping?
- I went camping once.

867
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:31,608
You know what?
We oughta start camping more often.

868
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:35,049
You're right. Camping is good.
Time for bed.

869
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,451
- It's only 10:00.
- Yeah, 10:00.

870
00:58:37,522 --> 00:58:39,615
Time for bed.

871
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,351
Good night.

872
00:58:45,463 --> 00:58:48,557
Don't you wanna thank Victoria
for this delicious dinner?

873
00:58:48,633 --> 00:58:52,501
Thanks for dinner. I never saw
anybody cook potatoes that way.

874
00:58:53,938 --> 00:58:56,236
I'm glad you liked it.

875
00:58:56,307 --> 00:58:58,241
Good night, Jonah.

876
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,809
Yeah, we don't see
a lot of potatoes around here.

877
00:59:03,881 --> 00:59:05,815
We're rice men.

878
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:03,500
I'm sorry, Walter.
I'm sorry.

879
01:00:07,745 --> 01:00:10,043
- Hello?
- <i>Turn on your radio.</i>

880
01:00:10,114 --> 01:00:12,048
- What?
- <i>The kid is on.</i>

881
01:00:12,116 --> 01:00:14,710
<i>You've got me</i>
<i>listening to this garbage.</i>

882
01:00:14,785 --> 01:00:17,185
Who is it?

883
01:00:17,255 --> 01:00:21,419
It's Becky. She's...
She's having trouble with Rick again.

884
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:24,427
I'll go downstairs, Becky.
I'll call you back.

885
01:00:27,231 --> 01:00:29,893
I'm sorry, Walter.
Are you bleeding?

886
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:54,018
- <i>He's kissing her right this minute!</i>
<i>- Oh, really?</i>

887
01:00:54,091 --> 01:00:57,822
<i>Jonah, tell the truth.</i>
<i>Are you spying on your father?</i>

888
01:00:57,895 --> 01:01:01,023
- Who's he kissing right this minute?
- <i>Listen to this.</i>

889
01:01:01,098 --> 01:01:03,032
<i>I have to make them stop.</i>

890
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:06,695
- How am I gonna explain this to Walter?
- <i>She came over and cooked dinner.</i>

891
01:01:06,771 --> 01:01:09,899
<i>She brought two bags of groceries,</i>
<i>like she was staying for a year.</i>

892
01:01:09,974 --> 01:01:12,909
<i>Jonah, it's good</i>
<i>that your father's dating.</i>

893
01:01:12,977 --> 01:01:16,242
<i>It's just hard on you.</i>
<i>It's something you think you want.</i>

894
01:01:16,314 --> 01:01:20,114
- <i>Then when it happens, it scares you.</i>
<i>- That's not true.</i>

895
01:01:20,184 --> 01:01:23,153
<i>Think. Shouldn't your father</i>
<i>be the judge....</i>

896
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:26,156
<i>of whether someone is right</i>
<i>or wrong for him?</i>

897
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,215
<i>He's not sane enough</i>
<i>to judge anything.</i>

898
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:31,056
Now he's kissing her on the lips.
She's a 'ho!

899
01:01:31,128 --> 01:01:34,222
My dad's been captured by a 'ho!
What am I going to do?

900
01:01:34,298 --> 01:01:36,266
<i>Calm down, Jonah.</i>

901
01:01:36,334 --> 01:01:39,064
<i>Tomorrow morning when you're</i>
<i>having breakfast with your dad....</i>

902
01:01:39,136 --> 01:01:41,468
<i>tell him how you feel.</i>

903
01:01:41,539 --> 01:01:45,066
<i>It's not good to keep</i>
<i>your feelings inside you.</i>

904
01:01:49,347 --> 01:01:53,044
Miss Scarlet. In the broom closet.
With the radio.

905
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:59,189
You scared me.
Don't ever do that again.

906
01:02:02,793 --> 01:02:05,819
- I thought I saw a black widow.
- You scared me to death!

907
01:02:05,896 --> 01:02:09,195
- You scared Victoria to death.
- It was right over there.

908
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,964
The next time you think you see a
black widow spider, I want you to say...

909
01:02:13,037 --> 01:02:16,939
"Dad, excuse me, but I believe
a poisonous insect is in the house''...

910
01:02:17,008 --> 01:02:19,203
and I will calmly come
and take care of it.

911
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,835
Scream again, I'll kill you.

912
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:25,439
Becky heard this guy on the radio she
was sure was Rick. She was hysterical.

913
01:02:25,516 --> 01:02:29,714
And then it turned out
the guy lived in Duluth.

914
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:32,722
- Where is Duluth?
- That doesn't make any sense.

915
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:36,282
I know, Walter.
It doesn't make any sense at all.

916
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,988
Thank God my life is in place.

917
01:02:39,063 --> 01:02:41,964
Duluth? That's in North Dakota.

918
01:02:55,946 --> 01:02:59,939
I love this letter.
You have to write to her.

919
01:03:00,017 --> 01:03:03,145
- You think so?
- It's Y.O.H.

920
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,415
Yeah. What's that?

921
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:07,116
Your only hope.

922
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,401
I thought I would look into
doing a story on those radio shows.

923
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,173
You'd probably have to go somewhere
to really look into it.

924
01:03:26,811 --> 01:03:28,972
Definitely.

925
01:03:47,665 --> 01:03:49,792
Couldn't you do
a phone interview?

926
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:54,463
Not for the kind of piece I wanna do.
I won't be in Chicago that long.

927
01:03:54,538 --> 01:03:56,631
When you get back, I'll be gone.

928
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:59,175
And then I'll see you in New York.

929
01:03:59,243 --> 01:04:01,040
I'll get it.

930
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:06,448
<i>This is Captain Browning.</i>

931
01:04:06,517 --> 01:04:10,112
<i>We're at our cruising altitude</i>
<i>of approximately 35,000 feet.</i>

932
01:04:10,187 --> 01:04:14,988
<i>The weather is clear to the west, and we</i>
<i>expect to arrive in Seattle on schedule.</i>

933
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,961
- Don't you hate flying?
- Yes, I do.

934
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:23,932
And I just told the most terrible one
to the man I'm about to marry.

935
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:26,799
Do you feel that
any lie is a betrayal?

936
01:04:27,805 --> 01:04:29,796
I said "flying."

937
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,682
Thanks for bringing me out here.

938
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,184
Well, he likes the planes.

939
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:46,656
Can I bring something back for you?
A souvenir? Does he like snow globes?

940
01:04:46,724 --> 01:04:49,192
You shake them up
and then the snow floats down.

941
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,957
Sure. I'd really like that.
Thank you so much.

942
01:04:57,134 --> 01:04:59,261
- He's eight.
- He's good at it.

943
01:04:59,336 --> 01:05:01,270
I read an article about this.

944
01:05:01,338 --> 01:05:04,466
All children are hideous at age eight.
It's quite normal.

945
01:05:04,542 --> 01:05:06,772
Well, maybe when I come back...

946
01:05:06,844 --> 01:05:10,211
the two of us oughta spend
some time together on our own.

947
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,340
What do you think?

948
01:05:15,586 --> 01:05:17,520
Bye.

949
01:05:17,588 --> 01:05:19,249
Bye, Jonah.

950
01:05:26,664 --> 01:05:30,259
Listen to me.
You don't know Victoria.

951
01:05:30,334 --> 01:05:32,268
I hardly know her myself.

952
01:05:32,336 --> 01:05:35,271
She is, in fact,
a mystery to me.

953
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:38,672
She tosses her hair a lot.
Why does she do this?

954
01:05:38,742 --> 01:05:41,609
I have no idea. Is it a twitch?
Does she need a haircut?

955
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:45,206
Should she use a barrette
to keep her hair out of her face?

956
01:05:46,684 --> 01:05:49,881
These are things I'm willing
to get to the bottom of.

957
01:05:49,954 --> 01:05:53,321
And that is why I am dating her.

958
01:05:54,558 --> 01:05:56,651
That's all I'm doing.

959
01:05:56,727 --> 01:05:59,025
I'm not living with her.
<i>I'm</i> not marrying her.

960
01:05:59,096 --> 01:06:01,894
Can you appreciate
the difference?

961
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,824
This is what single people do.

962
01:06:04,902 --> 01:06:07,735
They try other people on
and see how they fit.

963
01:06:07,805 --> 01:06:10,569
But everybody's an adjustment.
Nobody's perfect.

964
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:14,103
There's no such thing
as a perfect...

965
01:06:30,294 --> 01:06:31,886
Come on.

966
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:37,562
Dad, I was talking to Jessica
about reincarnation.

967
01:06:37,635 --> 01:06:39,728
She says you knew Annie
in another life.

968
01:06:39,803 --> 01:06:42,363
- Who's Annie?
- The one who wrote us.

969
01:06:42,439 --> 01:06:45,966
But Jessica says you and Annie
never got together in that life.

970
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,705
So your hearts are like puzzles
with missing pieces.

971
01:06:48,779 --> 01:06:50,974
And when you get together,
the puzzle's complete.

972
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:52,572
Goddamn it.

973
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:55,710
The reason I know this and you don't
is because I'm younger and purer...

974
01:06:55,786 --> 01:06:58,914
so I'm more in touch
with cosmic forces.

975
01:06:58,989 --> 01:07:01,822
- Who told you this stuff?
- Jessica.

976
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:04,759
I sincerely hope
you're not marrying Jessica.

977
01:07:11,135 --> 01:07:15,697
<i>I remember the days</i>
<i>of just keepin' time</i>

978
01:07:15,773 --> 01:07:20,073
<i>Of hangin' around</i>
<i>in sleepy towns</i>

979
01:07:20,144 --> 01:07:22,305
<i>Forever</i>

980
01:07:22,379 --> 01:07:26,247
<i>Back roads empty for miles</i>

981
01:07:28,185 --> 01:07:32,622
<i>Well, you can't have a dream</i>
<i>and cut it to fit</i>

982
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:36,524
<i>But when I saw you</i>
<i>I knew</i>

983
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:39,062
<i>We'd go together</i>

984
01:07:39,129 --> 01:07:42,496
<i>Like a wink and a smile</i>

985
01:07:46,136 --> 01:07:50,095
<i>Leave your old jalopy</i>

986
01:07:50,174 --> 01:07:54,338
<i>By the railroad track</i>

987
01:07:54,411 --> 01:07:58,609
<i>We'll get a hip</i>
<i>double-dip, tip-toppy</i>

988
01:07:58,682 --> 01:08:01,810
<i>Two-seat Pontiac</i>

989
01:08:04,188 --> 01:08:07,316
<i>So you can rev her up</i>

990
01:08:07,391 --> 01:08:09,325
<i>Don't go slow</i>

991
01:08:09,393 --> 01:08:12,851
<i>It's only green lights</i>
<i>and all rights</i>

992
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:16,093
<i>Let's go together</i>

993
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:18,964
<i>With a wink and a smile</i>

994
01:08:33,283 --> 01:08:36,252
<i>Give me a wink and a smile</i>

995
01:08:48,198 --> 01:08:50,132
<i>We go together</i>

996
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,964
<i>Like a wink and a smile</i>

997
01:08:56,874 --> 01:09:00,469
<i>Now my heart hears music</i>

998
01:09:00,544 --> 01:09:03,308
<i>Such a simple song</i>

999
01:09:04,882 --> 01:09:08,841
<i>Sing it again</i>
<i>The notes never end</i>

1000
01:09:08,919 --> 01:09:12,355
<i>This is where I belong</i>

1001
01:09:13,657 --> 01:09:17,252
<i>Just the sound of your voice</i>
<i>The light in your eyes</i>

1002
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:21,923
<i>We're so far away</i>
<i>from yesterday</i>

1003
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:24,559
<i>Together</i>

1004
01:09:24,635 --> 01:09:27,832
<i>With a wink and a smile</i>

1005
01:09:30,741 --> 01:09:34,438
<i>We go together</i>

1006
01:09:34,511 --> 01:09:38,413
<i>Like a wink and a smile</i>

1007
01:09:48,459 --> 01:09:52,190
- <i>I watched him play with his son.</i>
- <i>Did you talk to him?</i>

1008
01:09:53,263 --> 01:09:55,197
I <i>couldn't</i> do it.

1009
01:09:57,301 --> 01:10:00,737
- How did I get here?
<i>- You told a lie and got on a plane.</i>

1010
01:10:00,804 --> 01:10:02,795
That's not what I mean.

1011
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:08,110
I'm going back over there tomorrow
and talk to him. I am.

1012
01:10:08,178 --> 01:10:11,272
<i>Okay. Good.</i>
<i>Good-bye.</i>

1013
01:10:11,348 --> 01:10:13,282
- Beck?
- <i>What?</i>

1014
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:18,085
- Is this crazy?
- <i>No.</i>

1015
01:10:18,155 --> 01:10:20,521
<i>That's the weirdest part about it.</i>

1016
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:24,322
Thank you.
I love you.

1017
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:27,022
- <i>I love you too.</i>
- Good night.

1018
01:11:29,626 --> 01:11:33,062
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Where's Greg?

1019
01:11:57,321 --> 01:11:58,253
Hello.

1020
01:12:07,564 --> 01:12:11,728
<i>- So then what happened?</i>
- <i>So then I left, obviously.</i>

1021
01:12:12,569 --> 01:12:14,537
You were standing
in the middle of the street?

1022
01:12:14,605 --> 01:12:18,405
You know that dream when you're on the
street naked and everyone is looking?

1023
01:12:18,475 --> 01:12:20,170
I love that dream.

1024
01:12:20,244 --> 01:12:23,873
That was nothing compared
to this humiliation. Nothing.

1025
01:12:23,947 --> 01:12:26,006
- But he saw you, right?
- He saw me.

1026
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:29,575
- You were face-to-face?
- He said hello.

1027
01:12:29,653 --> 01:12:33,089
- He said hello, and what did you say?
- All I could say was hello.

1028
01:12:34,157 --> 01:12:36,022
Oh, my God!

1029
01:12:36,093 --> 01:12:39,961
<i>And all I could say was hello.</i>

1030
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:42,089
It's a sign.

1031
01:12:42,165 --> 01:12:46,363
It's a sign that I have watched
this movie too many times.

1032
01:12:47,437 --> 01:12:49,098
So stupid.

1033
01:12:49,172 --> 01:12:54,075
Since I listened to that stupid program
on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.

1034
01:12:54,144 --> 01:12:56,840
- You are not a jerk.
- Thank you.

1035
01:12:56,914 --> 01:13:00,077
- Idiot.
- You don't know who she was.

1036
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:04,086
I saw her. I have a picture of her.
I'll show you a picture of her.

1037
01:13:04,154 --> 01:13:07,021
That detective in Seattle
sent me a picture of her.

1038
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:09,024
Here. See?

1039
01:13:09,092 --> 01:13:11,458
That's exactly
what she looks like.

1040
01:13:11,528 --> 01:13:13,723
This is a picture
of someone's back.

1041
01:13:13,797 --> 01:13:17,062
Well, it's her
and he was crazy about her.

1042
01:13:17,134 --> 01:13:20,535
What's this?
This is from Seattle.

1043
01:13:32,482 --> 01:13:34,416
So I mailed your letter.

1044
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:39,620
"Dear Annie,
thanks for your letter.

1045
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:42,853
It was great.
You sound neat.

1046
01:13:46,163 --> 01:13:49,894
We're very excited about meeting you
in New York on Valentine's Day...

1047
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,800
and seeing if we are...

1048
01:13:52,869 --> 01:13:55,429
M.F.E.O.

1049
01:13:55,505 --> 01:13:56,938
See you soon.

1050
01:13:57,708 --> 01:14:00,506
Sleepless in Seattle."

1051
01:14:00,577 --> 01:14:01,839
M.F. E. O?

1052
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:09,012
Made for each other.

1053
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:13,286
<i>It's</i> cute.
It's like a little clue.

1054
01:14:17,894 --> 01:14:21,159
So he can't write. Big deal.

1055
01:14:21,231 --> 01:14:24,064
Verbal ability is a highly
overrated thing in a guy...

1056
01:14:24,134 --> 01:14:27,035
and our pathetic need for it
is what gets us into trouble.

1057
01:14:27,104 --> 01:14:31,006
I will be running back to Walter's arms,
if he'll still have me.

1058
01:14:31,074 --> 01:14:33,133
- What about the letter?
- It means nothing.

1059
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:36,441
It was written before
I went out there, before the 'ho.

1060
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:43,374
The only thing is,
she didn't look like a 'ho.

1061
01:14:43,453 --> 01:14:46,320
She looked like somebody
we would've been friends with.

1062
01:14:50,961 --> 01:14:53,862
- You saw her in the airport, then here?
- I tried to talk to her.

1063
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:56,330
It was like I knew her.
It was weird.

1064
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,833
Like a deja vu thing?

1065
01:14:57,901 --> 01:15:02,065
It was a very French
deja vu-ish kind of thing. <i>Oui.</i>

1066
01:15:02,139 --> 01:15:05,666
At least you're out there
seeing people again. That's terrific.

1067
01:15:05,742 --> 01:15:07,710
Well, <i>there's</i> really just the one.

1068
01:15:08,278 --> 01:15:10,678
Victoria.

1069
01:15:10,747 --> 01:15:13,580
- You don't like Victoria?
- She laughs like a hyena.

1070
01:15:14,317 --> 01:15:16,251
Is this true?

1071
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:20,614
Sort of, a little bit.
Tell them what you did.

1072
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:24,360
Tell 'em about the radio show.
They wanna hear it.

1073
01:15:24,428 --> 01:15:29,263
Tell 'em. Christmas Eve, he phones in
one of those radio call-in shows.

1074
01:15:29,332 --> 01:15:32,301
Tells them I need a new wife.

1075
01:15:32,369 --> 01:15:34,132
Oh, you're kidding.

1076
01:15:34,204 --> 01:15:36,195
That's so sweet.

1077
01:15:36,273 --> 01:15:40,266
- He's obsessed with a lady who wrote me.
- You serious?

1078
01:15:40,343 --> 01:15:43,312
She wants to meet me at the top
of the Empire State Building.

1079
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,871
On Valentine's Day.

1080
01:15:45,949 --> 01:15:48,645
- It's like that movie.
- What movie?

1081
01:15:48,718 --> 01:15:51,619
<i>An Affair To Remember.</i>
Did you ever see it?

1082
01:15:51,688 --> 01:15:53,679
Oh, God.

1083
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:56,988
Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.
Is it "car" or "cur"?

1084
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,618
- Cur.
- Car.

1085
01:16:00,564 --> 01:16:03,294
She's gonna meet him at the top
of the Empire State Building...

1086
01:16:03,366 --> 01:16:05,926
only she got hit by a taxi.

1087
01:16:06,002 --> 01:16:07,936
And he waited and waited.

1088
01:16:08,004 --> 01:16:10,996
And it was raining, I think.

1089
01:16:11,074 --> 01:16:12,166
And then...

1090
01:16:12,242 --> 01:16:15,507
she's too proud to tell him...

1091
01:16:15,579 --> 01:16:17,740
that she's, uh...

1092
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:22,175
crippled.

1093
01:16:22,252 --> 01:16:26,086
And he's too proud to find out
why she doesn't come.

1094
01:16:26,156 --> 01:16:28,124
But he comes to see her anyway.

1095
01:16:28,191 --> 01:16:30,489
I forget why, but, oh...

1096
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,860
Oh, it's so amazing
when he comes to see her because...

1097
01:16:34,931 --> 01:16:39,027
he doesn't even notice that
she doesn't get up to say hello.

1098
01:16:39,102 --> 01:16:41,593
And he's very bitter.

1099
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:47,376
And you think that he's just gonna
walk out the door...

1100
01:16:47,444 --> 01:16:52,143
and never know why she's just
lying there, you know, on the couch...

1101
01:16:52,215 --> 01:16:56,652
with this blanket
over her shriveled little legs.

1102
01:16:58,788 --> 01:17:01,882
- Are you all right?
- She's fine.

1103
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:05,416
Suddenly he goes,
I already sold the painting."

1104
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:08,555
And he like
goes to the bedroom...

1105
01:17:08,632 --> 01:17:12,693
and he looks and he comes out and
he looks at her and he kind of just...

1106
01:17:12,769 --> 01:17:16,330
They know and then they hug.
And it's so...

1107
01:17:17,274 --> 01:17:20,573
- That's a chick's movie.
- I would say so.

1108
01:17:20,644 --> 01:17:24,011
What kind of a person would write
to someone they heard on the radio?

1109
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,174
I got hundreds of letters
from women all over the country.

1110
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,683
Desperate women.

1111
01:17:28,752 --> 01:17:32,085
Just because someone is looking for
a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.

1112
01:17:32,155 --> 01:17:34,521
How about rapacious
and love-starved?

1113
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:37,719
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist
than to find a husband after the age...

1114
01:17:37,794 --> 01:17:39,921
That is absolutely untrue.

1115
01:17:39,996 --> 01:17:42,226
Right, honey. Right.

1116
01:17:42,299 --> 01:17:44,699
I'm not <i>lookin'</i> for
a mail-order bride.

1117
01:17:44,768 --> 01:17:48,795
I just want somebody that I can have a
decent conversation with over dinner...

1118
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:52,399
without it fallin' down
into weepy tears over some movie.

1119
01:17:52,475 --> 01:17:53,965
She's very emotional.

1120
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:56,171
- But I cried at <i>The Dirty Dozen.</i>
- Who didn't?

1121
01:17:56,246 --> 01:17:59,704
Jim Brown is throwin' these
hand grenades down these air shafts...

1122
01:17:59,783 --> 01:18:02,980
and Richard Jaeckel and Lee Marvin
were sittin' on top of this...

1123
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:05,851
armored personnel carrier,
dressed up like Nazis.

1124
01:18:05,922 --> 01:18:09,119
They're waiting.
Trini Lopez...

1125
01:18:10,427 --> 01:18:13,828
He busted his neck when they were
parachuting down behind the Nazi lines.

1126
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:15,455
Stop it.

1127
01:18:15,532 --> 01:18:19,593
Richard Jaeckel had on this shiny helmet
'cause he was the M.P.

1128
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:20,601
No more.

1129
01:18:21,871 --> 01:18:24,635
Oh, God, I love that movie.

1130
01:18:32,449 --> 01:18:35,714
This is the best movie
I've ever seen in my life.

1131
01:18:35,785 --> 01:18:37,514
<i>What's</i> so great about it?

1132
01:18:37,587 --> 01:18:40,181
You have to find her.
You have to go to her.

1133
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:42,418
Do you know how much money it costs
to go to New York?

1134
01:18:42,492 --> 01:18:44,426
Nobody knows.

1135
01:18:44,494 --> 01:18:48,624
It changes practically every day.
How much money do you have?

1136
01:18:48,698 --> 01:18:50,131
Eighty dollars.

1137
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,601
I have 42. That would
probably cover taxicabs.

1138
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:55,160
How would I get there?

1139
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:58,730
Honey, I have to run
these tickets over to someone.

1140
01:18:58,808 --> 01:19:00,742
Can you keep an eye on things?

1141
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:02,903
Sure, Mom.

1142
01:19:13,089 --> 01:19:16,422
- Do you want a window seat or an aisle?
- Window.

1143
01:19:16,493 --> 01:19:18,791
- Do you want a fruit plate?
- I don't know. Do I?

1144
01:19:18,862 --> 01:19:21,592
I'd rather die
than eat airplane food.

1145
01:19:21,665 --> 01:19:23,895
I'm telling them you're 12
so you can fly unaccompanied...

1146
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:25,992
and the stewardess
won't carry you around.

1147
01:19:26,069 --> 01:19:28,697
Are you crazy?
Who'd believe I'm 12?

1148
01:19:28,772 --> 01:19:31,707
If it's in the computer,
they believe anything.

1149
01:19:31,775 --> 01:19:33,709
Are you sure?

1150
01:19:33,777 --> 01:19:36,211
Do you want me to say that
you're really short for your age...

1151
01:19:36,279 --> 01:19:38,440
and that they shouldn't say anything
'cause it would hurt your feelings?

1152
01:19:38,515 --> 01:19:40,847
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1153
01:19:40,917 --> 01:19:45,786
<i>Sometimes it's hard to be</i>

1154
01:19:45,855 --> 01:19:47,823
<i>A woman</i>

1155
01:19:50,727 --> 01:19:53,787
<i>Givin' all your love</i>

1156
01:19:53,863 --> 01:19:58,357
<i>To just one man</i>

1157
01:19:58,435 --> 01:19:59,732
Walter.

1158
01:20:01,037 --> 01:20:04,803
- You're gonna miss the train.
- No, I'm not.

1159
01:20:04,874 --> 01:20:08,537
I'm so happy, Becky.
Finally I feel happy.

1160
01:20:08,611 --> 01:20:10,545
This is right. This is real.

1161
01:20:10,613 --> 01:20:13,343
Everything else is what happens
when you watch too many movies...

1162
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:15,907
and you completely
lose sight of what counts.

1163
01:20:15,985 --> 01:20:18,249
Please, don't tell anybody
what happened.

1164
01:20:18,321 --> 01:20:20,915
I would be so absolutely mortified
if anyone knew...

1165
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:24,289
I did anything even
remotely close to what I've done.

1166
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:27,353
- Thank you. Do you <i>promise?</i>
- I promise.

1167
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:29,864
Sleepless in Seattle
is history.

1168
01:20:29,933 --> 01:20:34,029
<i>He's hard to understand</i>

1169
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:40,733
<i>And if you love him</i>

1170
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:45,338
<i>Oh, be proud of him</i>

1171
01:20:45,415 --> 01:20:48,748
<i>'Cause after all</i>

1172
01:20:48,818 --> 01:20:51,616
<i>He's just a man</i>

1173
01:20:54,824 --> 01:20:57,759
<i>Stand by your man</i>

1174
01:21:00,697 --> 01:21:02,289
I was...

1175
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,668
- Go ahead.
- You go.

1176
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:08,169
Okay. Well,
I was just gonna say...

1177
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:11,833
that ever since Christmas,
you've been different...

1178
01:21:11,908 --> 01:21:14,468
kind of distracted, distant.

1179
01:21:14,544 --> 01:21:17,012
But now...

1180
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:21,744
it feels as if you're coming back
from wherever you were.

1181
01:21:21,818 --> 01:21:23,410
I am.

1182
01:21:25,321 --> 01:21:27,881
I was just, uh...

1183
01:21:27,957 --> 01:21:32,121
I just got...
I think I got nervous.

1184
01:21:32,195 --> 01:21:34,390
But that's normal, right?

1185
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:38,195
I mean, don't you ever
feel nervous about...

1186
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:40,236
You know?

1187
01:21:40,303 --> 01:21:42,328
What?

1188
01:21:42,405 --> 01:21:43,667
Forever.

1189
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:56,715
I did, and you know what I think?

1190
01:21:56,786 --> 01:22:01,018
I think I thought
it was too perfect, you know?

1191
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:04,582
I started to wonder
if we were the human equivalent...

1192
01:22:04,661 --> 01:22:06,788
of two rights making a wrong.

1193
01:22:06,863 --> 01:22:08,797
You know what it was?

1194
01:22:08,865 --> 01:22:12,494
It was like kismet, but not,
if you see what I mean.

1195
01:22:14,037 --> 01:22:15,470
You have to grow up.

1196
01:22:15,538 --> 01:22:18,336
You just can't keep having
all these adolescent fantasies...

1197
01:22:18,408 --> 01:22:20,842
about how exciting
your life is gonna be.

1198
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:23,572
Don't hate me,
but I love this pattern.

1199
01:22:23,646 --> 01:22:25,671
- You couldn't.
- I do.

1200
01:22:25,748 --> 01:22:28,581
This is just like
my grandmother's china.

1201
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:31,119
How many place settings
should I put down?

1202
01:22:31,187 --> 01:22:32,779
Ten.

1203
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:38,325
Exactly. Eight is too few.

1204
01:22:38,394 --> 01:22:41,056
Twelve is too many.

1205
01:23:06,589 --> 01:23:08,523
It was my mother's.

1206
01:23:10,493 --> 01:23:12,757
I had them size it down.

1207
01:23:14,163 --> 01:23:16,256
She had really fat fingers.

1208
01:23:18,768 --> 01:23:20,463
It's so beautiful.

1209
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:23,734
It's exactly what I would
pick out if I had...

1210
01:23:23,806 --> 01:23:26,639
every ring in the whole world
to choose from.

1211
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:30,769
You see what I mean?

1212
01:23:30,847 --> 01:23:34,374
There are people who would like
a relationship to be full of surprises.

1213
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:36,816
But I am not one of those people.

1214
01:23:36,886 --> 01:23:39,116
No, sirree.

1215
01:23:39,188 --> 01:23:41,884
Surprises are highly overrated.

1216
01:23:44,761 --> 01:23:47,889
I'm leavin' first thing in the morning,
but I'm only gonna be gone one night.

1217
01:23:47,964 --> 01:23:50,091
Clarise is gonna be here,
so you'll be able to see...

1218
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:52,498
plenty of <i>Geraldo</i>
and <i>Nightmare On Elm Street 12.</i>

1219
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:54,867
- I will never know.
- Are you going with her?

1220
01:23:56,806 --> 01:23:58,899
I'm going with Victoria, yes.

1221
01:24:01,144 --> 01:24:03,942
And <i>don't</i> try anything tricky.
Understand?

1222
01:24:07,016 --> 01:24:10,076
Don't go rollin' in poison ivy
as soon as I leave the house...

1223
01:24:10,153 --> 01:24:13,589
or lock yourself in a closet or do
anything that makes you need stitches.

1224
01:24:13,656 --> 01:24:15,749
If your finger falls off,
it's stayin' off.

1225
01:24:15,825 --> 01:24:18,259
No one's gonna pack it on ice
and take you to the hospital...

1226
01:24:18,328 --> 01:24:21,491
so you can be
a breakthrough in laser surgery.

1227
01:24:21,564 --> 01:24:24,624
- Is this about that woman in Baltimore?
- Annie.

1228
01:24:29,138 --> 01:24:31,572
- I don't care what you do!
- Good! Fine!

1229
01:24:31,641 --> 01:24:34,940
I'll tell you what I'm doin'
this weekend. I'm getting laid.

1230
01:24:35,011 --> 01:24:37,002
1990s and nobody is getting laid.

1231
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,742
<i>I'm</i> the only man in America
who is getting laid this weekend.

1232
01:24:39,816 --> 01:24:44,150
I haven't been laid that much.
Six girls in college, maybe seven.

1233
01:24:45,421 --> 01:24:48,390
- How long you been standin' there?
- Forever.

1234
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:52,292
- What did you hear me just say?
- "Six girls in college, maybe seven."

1235
01:24:52,362 --> 01:24:55,092
Seven.
Eight! Mary Kelly.

1236
01:24:55,164 --> 01:24:56,631
This is the one I like.

1237
01:24:59,535 --> 01:25:01,696
Jonah, the fact is...

1238
01:25:01,771 --> 01:25:04,797
you're not gonna like any woman
because it isn't your mother.

1239
01:25:04,874 --> 01:25:06,466
How do you know?

1240
01:25:06,542 --> 01:25:10,000
- What's wrong with Annie?
- Oh, Jonah, shut up!

1241
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:12,639
Shut up?

1242
01:25:12,715 --> 01:25:16,151
Mom never said "shut <i>up''</i> to me.
Mom never yelled at me.

1243
01:25:16,219 --> 01:25:19,382
- The conversation is finished.
- Why can't we go to New York?

1244
01:25:19,455 --> 01:25:22,219
There is no way
that we are going on a plane...

1245
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:24,782
to meet some woman
who could be a crazy, sick lunatic.

1246
01:25:24,861 --> 01:25:27,386
- Didn't you see <i>Fatal Attraction?</i>
- You wouldn't let me.

1247
01:25:27,463 --> 01:25:30,023
Well, I saw it!
And it scared the shit outta me.

1248
01:25:30,099 --> 01:25:33,159
It scared the shit
outta every man in America!

1249
01:25:34,103 --> 01:25:36,571
I'm not leaving till you say yes.

1250
01:25:42,311 --> 01:25:45,246
- I hate you!
- That's good!

1251
01:25:45,314 --> 01:25:46,872
You'll have to tell Oprah.

1252
01:25:46,949 --> 01:25:49,247
How your dad destroyed your life
'cause he had to go off...

1253
01:25:49,318 --> 01:25:52,845
for a weekend special
at the Holiday Inn!

1254
01:26:07,336 --> 01:26:10,772
Jonah, Clarise is here
and I gotta go.

1255
01:26:12,809 --> 01:26:14,470
Hey, Jonah.

1256
01:26:21,451 --> 01:26:23,749
All right.
Jonah, listen.

1257
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:26,186
I gotta go, and I'm...

1258
01:26:54,617 --> 01:26:57,108
Jessica, honey,
you have to tell us where he is.

1259
01:26:57,186 --> 01:27:00,622
Jonah's daddy is very upset.

1260
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:04,217
This is your father.
Tell us where he is, right this minute.

1261
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:09,225
N.Y.

1262
01:27:09,298 --> 01:27:11,323
- What is that?
- No way.

1263
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,994
That's N.W.

1264
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:16,231
New York.

1265
01:27:16,305 --> 01:27:18,239
He's on his way to New York.

1266
01:27:18,307 --> 01:27:19,774
- What?
- How?

1267
01:27:19,842 --> 01:27:23,073
- United 597.
- Jessica.

1268
01:27:23,146 --> 01:27:25,774
- When does it leave?
- 7:30.

1269
01:27:32,722 --> 01:27:35,748
Here you go. Here's a nice pen
for you for flying with us.

1270
01:27:35,825 --> 01:27:37,258
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1271
01:27:37,326 --> 01:27:39,590
- Can I take this for you?
- No.

1272
01:27:55,444 --> 01:27:57,776
- Where to, kid?
- Empire State Building.

1273
01:27:57,847 --> 01:28:00,680
Hold on.
Empire State Building.

1274
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:04,117
Get a little further away
from the curb next time, mac.

1275
01:28:05,955 --> 01:28:07,217
There it is.

1276
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:09,952
What you gonna do
when you get up there?

1277
01:28:10,026 --> 01:28:12,187
- Spit off the top?
- No.

1278
01:28:12,261 --> 01:28:14,889
I'm going to meet my new mother.

1279
01:28:34,817 --> 01:28:37,718
Excuse me. I'm Jonah.
Are you Annie?

1280
01:28:37,787 --> 01:28:40,051
No. I'm Cynthia.

1281
01:28:47,163 --> 01:28:49,757
Excuse me.
Are you Annie?

1282
01:29:28,104 --> 01:29:30,038
Great table. Thanks.

1283
01:29:32,441 --> 01:29:34,204
Something wrong?

1284
01:29:35,378 --> 01:29:38,040
- Can I get you a drink?
- Some champagne?

1285
01:29:39,649 --> 01:29:42,117
Fine.

1286
01:29:42,184 --> 01:29:43,617
Can we have a bottle...

1287
01:29:43,686 --> 01:29:46,587
of Dom DeLuise?

1288
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:50,859
- Just kidding.
- It was a joke.

1289
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:53,555
- He meant Dom Perignon.
- I got it.

1290
01:29:57,133 --> 01:29:59,363
Beautiful view, isn't it?

1291
01:29:59,435 --> 01:30:04,270
Walter, there's something
I have to tell you.

1292
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:21,222
Hey, I'm sorry.
I have an emergency.

1293
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:23,986
Look! Money!
All right?

1294
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,324
- Get right in.
- Wait a minute.

1295
01:30:26,395 --> 01:30:27,987
Taxi!

1296
01:31:41,804 --> 01:31:46,036
So, he could be on top
of the Empire State Building now.

1297
01:31:48,677 --> 01:31:50,736
I guess he could be.

1298
01:31:53,382 --> 01:31:55,816
It's not him, Walter.
It's me.

1299
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:59,354
I can't do this.

1300
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:03,685
Look, Annie...

1301
01:32:03,759 --> 01:32:07,456
I love you,
but let's leave that outta this.

1302
01:32:08,731 --> 01:32:11,632
I don't wanna be someone
that you're settling for.

1303
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:15,568
I don't wanna be someone
that anyone settles for.

1304
01:32:17,206 --> 01:32:19,140
Marriage is hard enough...

1305
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:22,939
without bringing such
low expectations into it.

1306
01:32:23,012 --> 01:32:24,445
Isn't it?

1307
01:32:25,347 --> 01:32:27,815
Walter, I don't deserve you.

1308
01:32:28,684 --> 01:32:31,118
I wouldn't put it that way.

1309
01:32:32,621 --> 01:32:34,987
But, okay.

1310
01:32:51,173 --> 01:32:52,435
You okay?

1311
01:32:53,375 --> 01:32:55,172
Yeah.

1312
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:02,474
- What?
- Look.

1313
01:33:11,193 --> 01:33:14,253
- <i>It's</i> a sign.
- Who needed a sign?

1314
01:33:17,633 --> 01:33:19,328
I have to go.

1315
01:33:54,303 --> 01:33:58,637
What if something had happened to you?
What if I couldn't get to you?

1316
01:33:58,707 --> 01:34:01,505
I'm sorry.

1317
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:05,804
What would I have done?

1318
01:34:05,881 --> 01:34:09,180
You are my family.
You're all I've got.

1319
01:34:09,251 --> 01:34:11,811
I thought she'd be here.
I thought she'd come.

1320
01:34:11,887 --> 01:34:14,481
We're doin' okay, aren't we?
Aren't we all right?

1321
01:34:14,557 --> 01:34:17,424
- Have I done anything really stupid?
- No.

1322
01:34:17,493 --> 01:34:19,984
- Have I screwed it up for both of us?
- No.

1323
01:35:13,682 --> 01:35:17,083
- Observation deck?
- Sorry, ma'am, but it's too late.

1324
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,515
Please. I really need
to get up there.

1325
01:35:20,589 --> 01:35:23,023
We're closing up.
No more runs tonight.

1326
01:35:28,731 --> 01:35:30,995
Listen.

1327
01:35:31,066 --> 01:35:34,627
Can I just take a look?
<i>There's</i> someone I was supposed to meet.

1328
01:35:34,703 --> 01:35:37,331
He's probably not there,
but if I don't at least look...

1329
01:35:37,406 --> 01:35:39,840
I'll always wonder about it.

1330
01:35:39,908 --> 01:35:41,842
Cary Grant, right?

1331
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:44,208
You know that movie?

1332
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,544
One of my wife's favorites.

1333
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:58,454
Maybe when we get home
we'll get a dog.

1334
01:35:58,527 --> 01:36:01,826
- Okay.
- What do you mean "okay"?

1335
01:36:01,897 --> 01:36:05,060
- Wouldn't you like to have a dog?
- Sure.

1336
01:36:17,846 --> 01:36:20,508
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.

1337
01:36:22,985 --> 01:36:25,852
Can I take a minute?

1338
01:36:25,921 --> 01:36:27,513
Go ahead.

1339
01:37:41,363 --> 01:37:43,524
I left it by the telescopes.

1340
01:38:10,392 --> 01:38:12,724
- It's you.
- It's me.

1341
01:38:12,795 --> 01:38:16,629
- I saw you in the street.
- Are you Annie?

1342
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,465
Yes.

1343
01:38:23,305 --> 01:38:25,136
You're Annie?

1344
01:38:27,843 --> 01:38:29,868
This must be yours.

1345
01:38:29,945 --> 01:38:33,176
I'm Jonah.
This is my dad.

1346
01:38:33,248 --> 01:38:35,182
- His name's Sam.
- Hi, Jonah.

1347
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:46,252
- And who's this?
- Howard.

1348
01:38:46,328 --> 01:38:49,092
Oh, Howard.
Hello, Howard.

1349
01:39:04,513 --> 01:39:05,775
We better go.

1350
01:39:13,589 --> 01:39:15,523
Shall we?

1351
01:39:46,955 --> 01:39:51,187
<i>It's so important</i>
<i>to make someone happy</i>

1352
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:55,390
<i>Make just one someone happy</i>

1353
01:39:55,464 --> 01:40:00,424
<i>Make just one heart</i>
<i>the heart you</i>

1354
01:40:00,502 --> 01:40:03,027
- <i>You sing to</i>
- Sam.

1355
01:40:04,339 --> 01:40:06,569
It's nice to meet you.

1356
01:40:07,809 --> 01:40:11,905
<i>One face that lights</i>
<i>when it nears you</i>

1357
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:14,448
<i>One girl you're</i>

1358
01:40:14,516 --> 01:40:19,613
<i>You're everything to</i>

1359
01:40:19,688 --> 01:40:22,282
<i>Fame</i>

1360
01:40:22,357 --> 01:40:24,416
<i>If you win it</i>

1361
01:40:24,493 --> 01:40:28,657
<i>Comes and goes in a minute</i>

1362
01:40:28,730 --> 01:40:32,689
<i>Where's the real stuff in life</i>

1363
01:40:32,768 --> 01:40:36,568
<i>To cling to</i>

1364
01:40:36,638 --> 01:40:41,098
<i>Love is the answer</i>

1365
01:40:41,176 --> 01:40:45,613
<i>Someone to love is the answer</i>

1366
01:40:45,681 --> 01:40:49,777
<i>Once you've found her</i>

1367
01:40:49,851 --> 01:40:54,049
<i>Build your world around her</i>

1368
01:40:54,122 --> 01:40:58,286
<i>Make someone happy</i>

1369
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:02,558
<i>Make just one someone happy</i>

1370
01:41:02,631 --> 01:41:08,399
<i>And you will be happy too</i>

1371
01:45:04,001 --> 01:45:05,399
---the end---
