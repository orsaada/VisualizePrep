1
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,912
Dismount!

2
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:05,621
Herman's horse-sick!

3
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:15,254
Chaps, no one wander off.

4
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:18,495
Some of the passageways
in here can run for miles.

5
00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:31,906
I don't think
this is such a good idea.

6
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:37,081
What is it?

7
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,838
Alfred, did you
get anything yet?

8
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:04,846
Nothing.

9
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:05,904
Then keep digging.

10
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:06,950
The kid's got something!

11
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:09,679
Whoo! Yee-hoo!

12
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:10,742
I got something, Garth!

13
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:13,381
I got something...
I got something right here.

14
00:03:19,997 --> 00:03:21,487
Oh, look at that!

15
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:22,725
Whoo!

16
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,767
We're rich! We're rich!

17
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:25,631
Shut up. Shut up.

18
00:03:25,702 --> 00:03:26,930
Well, we're rich, ain't we?

19
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:31,635
Indy...

20
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,970
Indy?

21
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:34,738
What are they doing?

22
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:37,303
Indiana? Indiana?

23
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:39,212
Shh!

24
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,546
Hey, we got to find
more stuff to bring back.

25
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:46,612
It's the Cross of Coronado.

26
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,284
Cortez gave it to him
in 1520.

27
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,986
Ah! Oh, boy! Whoo!

28
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:53,529
I'm thinkin' about
raisin' my dead mama,

29
00:03:53,597 --> 00:03:56,031
dig down and put it on
her bony finger!

30
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,533
That cross
is an important artifact.

31
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:00,194
It belongs in a museum.

32
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,828
Run back
and find the others.

33
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:05,238
Tell Mr.Havelock that there are
men looting in the caves.

34
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:06,401
Have him bring
the sheriff.

35
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:08,308
It's only a snake.

36
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:10,073
Did you hear what I said?

37
00:04:10,147 --> 00:04:11,546
Right. Run back...

38
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:13,947
Mr.Havelock...
the sheriff...

39
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:16,212
What, what are you
gonna do?

40
00:04:16,286 --> 00:04:17,480
I don't know.

41
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:19,181
I'll think
of something.

42
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:25,594
Dig with your hands,

43
00:04:25,662 --> 00:04:27,061
not with your mouth.

44
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:43,605
He's got our thing!

45
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,341
- Get him!
- Get off me!

46
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:52,352
Mr.Havelock!

47
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:53,354
Anybody!

48
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:55,550
Everybody's lost but me.

49
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:56,718
There he is!

50
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:58,351
Let's go! Let's go!

51
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:16,708
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Dang it!

52
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:21,848
Hyah! Hyah!

53
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,908
Hey!

54
00:05:22,986 --> 00:05:24,977
Come back here!

55
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:38,731
Come on! Get him!

56
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:48,802
Hey, come back here!

57
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:12,228
Oh!

58
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:40,627
Aah... Oh!

59
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:56,637
Here, let me.

60
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:03,916
Oh, oh...

61
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:36,717
Holy smokes!

62
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:01,635
Come on, kid.

63
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:05,642
There's no way out of this.

64
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:22,330
Hey!

65
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,081
Toss up the whip.

66
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:52,019
You got heart, kid,
but that belongs to me.

67
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:53,357
It belongs to Coronado.

68
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,692
Coronado is dead,

69
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:56,824
and so are all
of his grandchildren.

70
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,232
This should be in a museum.

71
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:00,291
Now give it back!

72
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:05,307
A snake!

73
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,307
Snake! Aah!

74
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:07,570
Don't let him get away!

75
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,838
Magic?

76
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:13,815
Hold it.

77
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:15,681
Make sure he
doesn't double back.

78
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:34,765
Okay, kid,
out of the box, now.

79
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:37,538
Son of a...

80
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:50,276
Damn.

81
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:02,795
Dad!

82
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:07,128
Dad!

83
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,237
Dad.

84
00:10:10,473 --> 00:10:11,405
Dad... Out.

85
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:12,406
It's important.

86
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:14,102
Then wait.
Count to 20.

87
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:15,610
No, Dad. You listen to me.

88
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,611
Junior!

89
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,113
One, two, three, four...

90
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:20,115
In Greek.

91
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:35,927
"May he who illuminated this...

92
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:37,830
illuminate me."

93
00:10:42,873 --> 00:10:45,171
I brought the sheriff.

94
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:47,840
Just the man I want to see.

95
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:49,811
Now, there were five
or six of them...

96
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,904
- It's all right, son.
- They came after me...

97
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:52,107
You still got it?

98
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:53,342
Well, yes, sir.

99
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,940
It's right here.

100
00:10:55,018 --> 00:10:56,679
I'm glad to see that...

101
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:59,688
because the rightful
owner of this cross

102
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:02,748
won't press charges
if you give it back.

103
00:11:02,826 --> 00:11:06,318
He's got witnesses,
five or six of them.

104
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:19,472
Whoo! Yeah!

105
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:31,513
Good day.

106
00:11:36,593 --> 00:11:38,652
You lost today, kid,

107
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:42,494
but it doesn't mean
you have to like it.

108
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,951
Small world, Dr.Jones.

109
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:13,257
Too small for two of us.

110
00:12:21,471 --> 00:12:22,768
This is the second time

111
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,137
I've had to reclaim
my property from you.

112
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:27,368
That belongs in a museum.

113
00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:30,140
So do you.

114
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,907
Throw him over the side.

115
00:13:19,796 --> 00:13:22,196
Grab him, he's getting away!
Stop him!

116
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,479
Archaeology is the search

117
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:20,921
for fact...

118
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:24,920
...not truth.

119
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:26,586
If it's truth
you're interested in,

120
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:29,291
Dr.Tyree's philosophy class
is right down the hall.

121
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:32,132
So forget any ideas you've got

122
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:33,860
about lost cities,
exotic travel,

123
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:35,131
and digging up the world.

124
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:37,001
We do not follow maps
to buried treasure,

125
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:40,565
and "X" never, ever,
marks the spot.

126
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:45,477
Seventy percent
of all archaeology is done

127
00:14:45,548 --> 00:14:46,810
in the library.

128
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:49,852
Research. Reading.

129
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,013
We cannot afford
to take mythology

130
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,522
at face value.

131
00:14:56,726 --> 00:14:58,421
Next week: "Egyptology."

132
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:00,793
Starting with the excavation
of Naukratis

133
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:02,388
by Flinders Petrie in 1885.

134
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:03,489
I will be in my office

135
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:04,931
if anybody's got
any problems,

136
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,332
for the next hour
and a half.

137
00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:14,941
Marcus, I did it.

138
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:17,241
You've got it!

139
00:15:24,454 --> 00:15:26,786
Oh!

140
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:29,051
You know how long I've
been looking for that?

141
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,854
All your life.

142
00:15:30,927 --> 00:15:32,417
All my life.

143
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:33,587
Well done, Indy.

144
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:35,324
Very well done, indeed.

145
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:39,129
This will find a place of honor
in our Spanish collection.

146
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,134
We can discuss
my honorarium

147
00:15:41,204 --> 00:15:43,536
over dinner and
champagne tonight.

148
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:44,766
Your treat.

149
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:46,138
Yes.

150
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:48,369
My treat.

151
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:53,709
Dr.Jones!
Dr.Jones!

152
00:15:57,253 --> 00:15:59,153
Shush! Shush! Shush!

153
00:15:59,255 --> 00:16:00,984
Dr.Jones, I am so glad
you're back.

154
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:02,354
Your mail is on your desk.

155
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:03,824
Here are your
phone messages.

156
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:05,417
Dr.Jones, you promised...

157
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:06,860
This is your
appointment schedule,

158
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,955
and these term papers still
haven't been graded.

159
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:10,863
Okay. Irene,
put everybody's name on a list,

160
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:12,094
get the order they arrived...

161
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:13,328
Oh, come on, Dr.Jones.

162
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:14,495
Dr.Jones.

163
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:17,096
...and I'll see each
and every one of them...

164
00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:18,640
in turn.

165
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,587
"Venice, Italy."

166
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:03,049
Dr.Jones!

167
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:10,359
Dr.Jones?

168
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:29,372
I trust your trip down
was comfortable, Dr.Jones.

169
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:32,414
Uh, my men didn't alarm you,
I hope.

170
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:34,416
My name is Donovan.

171
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:35,576
Walter Donovan.

172
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:36,880
I know who you are,
Mr.Donovan.

173
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:38,250
Your contributions
to the museum

174
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:40,118
over the years have
been extremely generous.

175
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:41,348
Some of the pieces

176
00:17:41,424 --> 00:17:43,255
in your collection here
are very impressive.

177
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:45,055
Well, like yourself,
Dr.Jones,

178
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:46,925
I have a passion
for antiquities.

179
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:48,964
Have a look over here.

180
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,468
This might interest you.

181
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,473
Well, it's sandstone.

182
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,132
Christian symbol.

183
00:17:59,242 --> 00:18:01,073
Early Latin text.

184
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:03,645
Mid-12th century,
I should think.

185
00:18:03,713 --> 00:18:05,647
That was our
assessment, as well.

186
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:07,080
Where did this come from?

187
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,447
My engineers
unearthed it

188
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:10,577
in the mountain region
north of Ankara

189
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:12,086
while excavating
for copper.

190
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:14,121
Can you translate
the inscription?

191
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:20,929
"...who drinks the water
I shall give him, says the Lord,

192
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:24,262
"will have a... spring

193
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:27,826
"inside him welling up
for eternal life.

194
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:32,404
"Let them bring me
to your holy mountain

195
00:18:32,475 --> 00:18:34,238
"in the place where you dwell.

196
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,402
"Across the desert

197
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:37,503
"and through the mountain

198
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,605
"to the Canyon
of the Crescent Moon,

199
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:42,776
to the temple
where the cup that..."

200
00:18:46,189 --> 00:18:48,453
"Where the cup
that holds the blood

201
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:52,392
of Jesus Christ resides
forever."

202
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:56,125
The Holy Grail, Dr.Jones.

203
00:18:56,199 --> 00:19:00,192
The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.

204
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:03,500
The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion

205
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:07,270
and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.

206
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:09,277
The Arthur legend.

207
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:12,075
I've heard this
bedtime story before.

208
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:13,477
Eternal life, Dr.Jones!

209
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:15,881
The gift of youth to whoever
drinks from the Grail.

210
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:19,611
Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.

211
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:20,713
An old man's dream.

212
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,485
Every man's dream,

213
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:24,583
including your
father's, I believe.

214
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,664
Grail lore is his hobby.

215
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:31,723
He's a teacher
of medieval literature.

216
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:33,996
The one the students hope
they don't get.

217
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,096
Walter, you're neglecting
your guests.

218
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:39,733
Be along in a moment, dear.

219
00:19:44,814 --> 00:19:46,975
Hard to resist, isn't it?

220
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:50,416
The Holy Grail's final resting
place described in detail.

221
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:52,579
What good is it?

222
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:54,646
This grail tablet
speaks of deserts

223
00:19:54,724 --> 00:19:56,351
and mountains and canyons.

224
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:57,518
It's pretty vague.

225
00:19:57,593 --> 00:19:59,527
Where do you want
to start looking?

226
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:02,359
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

227
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:04,059
but the entire top portion
is missing.

228
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,122
Just the same, an attempt

229
00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:07,134
to recover the Grail
is currently underway.

230
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:13,267
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr.Jones.

231
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:16,243
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

232
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:18,872
it disappeared, and was lost
for a thousand years

233
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:20,279
before it was found again

234
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:22,340
by three knights
of the First Crusade.

235
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:23,942
Three brothers, to be exact.

236
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,988
I've heard this one, as well.

237
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:29,855
Two of these brothers walked
out of the desert 150 years

238
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,826
after having found the Grail

239
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:34,795
and began the long journey
back to France,

240
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:36,889
but only one of them made it.

241
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:39,434
And before dying
of extreme old age,

242
00:20:39,502 --> 00:20:41,663
he supposedly imparted
his tale

243
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:44,433
to a... to a Franciscan friar,
I think.

244
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:47,635
Not "supposedly,"
Dr.Jones.

245
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,041
This is the manuscript

246
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:52,103
in which the friar chronicled
the knight's story.

247
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:53,705
It doesn't reveal

248
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:55,375
the location of the Grail,
I'm afraid,

249
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:56,509
but the knight promised

250
00:20:56,586 --> 00:20:58,884
that two markers, that had been
left behind, would.

251
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:01,822
This tablet is one
of those markers.

252
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:04,883
It proves
the knight's story is true.

253
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:07,020
But as you pointed out,
it's incomplete.

254
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:08,859
Now, the second marker
is entombed

255
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:10,592
with the knight's dead brother.

256
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,258
Our project leader

257
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:14,326
believes that tomb to be located

258
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:16,428
within the city
of Venice, Italy.

259
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:20,999
As you can now see,
Dr.Jones,

260
00:21:21,077 --> 00:21:24,137
we're about
to complete a great quest

261
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,147
that began almost
2,000 years ago.

262
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,683
We're only one step away.

263
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:31,151
That's usually
when the ground falls out

264
00:21:31,254 --> 00:21:32,881
from underneath your feet.

265
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:35,583
You could be more right
than you know.

266
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:36,955
Yes?

267
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:39,358
We've hit a snag.

268
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:41,988
Our project leader has vanished,

269
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:44,157
along with all his research.

270
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:45,529
Uh, we received a cable

271
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:47,432
from his colleague,
Dr.Schneider,

272
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:49,368
who has no idea
of his whereabouts

273
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:50,769
or what's become of him.

274
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,401
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

275
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:58,880
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

276
00:21:58,948 --> 00:22:01,382
You've got
the wrong Jones,

277
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,781
Mr.Donovan.

278
00:22:04,186 --> 00:22:06,120
Why don't you try my father?

279
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:08,122
We already have.

280
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,681
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

281
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:24,328
Your father and I have been
friends since time began.

282
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:25,669
I've watched you grow up, Indy.

283
00:22:25,741 --> 00:22:27,333
I've watched
the two of you grow apart.

284
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,571
I've never seen you this
concerned about him before.

285
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:31,909
Dad?

286
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:33,141
He's an academic;
a bookworm.

287
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:34,341
He's not a field man.

288
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:36,351
Dad? Dad?

289
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,649
Dear God.

290
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:43,950
What has the old fool
got himself into now?

291
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:45,960
I don't know,

292
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:48,622
but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

293
00:22:48,698 --> 00:22:50,632
Dad?

294
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,395
It's today's mail,

295
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:54,663
and it's been opened.

296
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:57,672
Mail.

297
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,708
That's it, Marcus.

298
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:03,702
Venice, Italy.

299
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:08,642
What is it?

300
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:13,155
It's Dad's Grail diary.

301
00:23:14,924 --> 00:23:16,551
Every clue he followed.

302
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:18,025
Every discovery he made.

303
00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:21,154
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

304
00:23:22,665 --> 00:23:24,758
This is his whole life.

305
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:27,029
Why would he have
sent this to me?

306
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:28,900
I don't know,

307
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:32,737
but someone must want it
pretty badly.

308
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,778
Do you believe, Marcus?

309
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:59,398
Do you believe
the Grail actually exists?

310
00:23:59,468 --> 00:24:01,766
The search for the Cup of Christ

311
00:24:01,837 --> 00:24:04,863
is the search for the divine
in all of us.

312
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,567
But if you want facts, Indy,

313
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:08,041
I've none to give you.

314
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,668
At my age, I'm prepared

315
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:11,838
to take a few
things on faith.

316
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:19,621
Call Donovan, Marcus.

317
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:21,748
Tell him I'll take
that ticket to Venice now.

318
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:26,457
I'll tell him
we'll take two.

319
00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:34,002
All right, tell me what's going
to happen when we get to Venice.

320
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,334
Don't worry, Dr.Schneider
will be there to meet you.

321
00:24:36,405 --> 00:24:37,667
- Uh, Schneider?
- I maintain

322
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,401
an apartment in Venice.
It's at your disposal.

323
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:40,567
Oh, well, that's good.

324
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:42,611
Thank you.

325
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:45,580
Dr.Jones... good luck.

326
00:24:45,648 --> 00:24:47,411
Now be very careful.

327
00:24:47,483 --> 00:24:49,576
Don't trust anybody.

328
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:24,277
Signora?

329
00:25:24,353 --> 00:25:26,480
Signorina?

330
00:25:32,528 --> 00:25:34,462
Ah, Venice...

331
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,758
Yes.

332
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:38,299
Uh, how will we recognize
this Dr.Schneider

333
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:39,527
when we see him?

334
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:41,536
I don't know.

335
00:25:41,604 --> 00:25:42,901
Maybe he'll know us.

336
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:45,805
Dr.Jones?

337
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:46,967
Yes?

338
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:49,237
I knew it was you.

339
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:52,303
You have your father's eyes.

340
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:57,716
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

341
00:25:57,787 --> 00:26:00,915
Looks like the best parts have
already been spoken for.

342
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,548
Marcus Brody?

343
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:04,252
That's right.

344
00:26:04,326 --> 00:26:05,623
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

345
00:26:05,694 --> 00:26:06,922
Oh, how do you do?

346
00:26:06,996 --> 00:26:10,090
The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.

347
00:26:10,232 --> 00:26:11,096
He was very close

348
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:13,201
to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

349
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:15,066
I've never seen him so excited.

350
00:26:15,137 --> 00:26:16,934
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

351
00:26:17,006 --> 00:26:18,940
Who? Attila
the Professor?

352
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,441
He was never giddy,

353
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:22,704
even when he was
a schoolboy.

354
00:26:22,778 --> 00:26:25,838
Fraulein, will
you permit me?

355
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:27,007
I usually don't.

356
00:26:27,082 --> 00:26:28,413
I usually
don't, either.

357
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:29,610
In that case,
I permit you.

358
00:26:29,685 --> 00:26:30,811
It would make
me very happy.

359
00:26:30,886 --> 00:26:31,818
But I'm already sad.

360
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:33,218
By tomorrow,
it will have faded.

361
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:34,620
Tomorrow I'll
steal you another.

362
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,987
I hate to interrupt you,

363
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:37,286
but the reason
we're here...

364
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,792
Yes. I have something
to show you.

365
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:40,692
I left your father working
in the library.

366
00:26:40,763 --> 00:26:42,025
He sent me to the map section

367
00:26:42,097 --> 00:26:43,689
to fetch an ancient plan
of the city.

368
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:45,961
When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

369
00:26:46,035 --> 00:26:48,230
except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.

370
00:26:48,304 --> 00:26:50,272
Roman numerals.

371
00:26:50,372 --> 00:26:52,363
Here is the library.

372
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,932
That doesn't look much
like a library.

373
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,706
Looks like a
converted church.

374
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,714
In this case,
it's the literal truth.

375
00:26:59,782 --> 00:27:01,647
We are on holy ground.

376
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:03,184
These columns over here

377
00:27:03,252 --> 00:27:05,379
were brought back
as spoils of war

378
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:08,719
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

379
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:10,258
Now, please excuse me.

380
00:27:10,326 --> 00:27:12,954
The library's closing
in a few moments.

381
00:27:13,028 --> 00:27:15,895
I'll arrange for us
to stay a little longer.

382
00:27:18,968 --> 00:27:22,369
Marcus... I've seen
this window before.

383
00:27:22,438 --> 00:27:23,871
Where?

384
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:26,464
Right here,
in Dad's diary.

385
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:35,443
You see?

386
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:37,041
Look, Indy.

387
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:39,110
The Roman numerals.

388
00:27:39,188 --> 00:27:41,520
Dad was onto something here.

389
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,490
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

390
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,288
but we still don't know
what they mean.

391
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:47,522
Dad sent me this
diary for a reason.

392
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:48,688
Until we find
out why,

393
00:27:48,764 --> 00:27:50,129
I suggest we keep
it to ourselves.

394
00:27:50,232 --> 00:27:51,324
Find something?

395
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,958
Uh, yes.
Three, seven and ten.

396
00:27:53,035 --> 00:27:54,866
That window seems
to be the source

397
00:27:54,937 --> 00:27:56,131
of the Roman numerals.

398
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:57,604
My God,
I must be blind.

399
00:27:57,673 --> 00:28:00,540
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

400
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:02,474
he was looking
for the tomb itself.

401
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:03,977
Don't you get it?

402
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:05,775
The tomb is somewhere
in the library.

403
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:07,782
You said yourself
it used to be a church.

404
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,078
Look.

405
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:11,449
Three.

406
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:14,689
Three.

407
00:28:14,757 --> 00:28:15,917
Seven.

408
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:18,551
Seven. Ten.

409
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:20,562
And ten.

410
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:23,189
Now where's the ten?

411
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:25,825
Look around for the ten.

412
00:28:33,475 --> 00:28:37,002
Three and seven.

413
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,047
Seven and seven

414
00:28:39,114 --> 00:28:41,480
and ten.

415
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:02,760
Ten.

416
00:29:02,838 --> 00:29:06,501
"X" marks the spot.

417
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:05,055
Bingo.

418
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:06,726
You don't disappoint,
Dr.Jones.

419
00:30:06,802 --> 00:30:08,429
You're a great deal
like your father.

420
00:30:08,504 --> 00:30:10,131
Except he's lost,
and I'm not.

421
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:11,331
Lower me down.

422
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,541
Look after this for me,
will you?

423
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:38,924
Come on.

424
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:48,066
Pagan symbols.

425
00:30:48,143 --> 00:30:49,440
Fourth or fifth century.

426
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:50,603
Right.

427
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:53,443
600 years before
the Crusades.

428
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:55,881
The Christians would have
dug their own passages

429
00:30:55,951 --> 00:30:57,714
and burial chambers
centuries later.

430
00:30:57,786 --> 00:30:59,276
That's right.

431
00:30:59,354 --> 00:31:01,618
If there's a knight of
the First Crusade down here,

432
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,658
that's where we'll find him.

433
00:31:35,624 --> 00:31:36,716
What's this one?

434
00:31:37,793 --> 00:31:38,817
The Ark of the Covenant.

435
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:39,952
Are you sure?

436
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:41,427
Pretty sure.

437
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,446
Watch out.

438
00:32:16,165 --> 00:32:17,359
It's petroleum.

439
00:32:17,432 --> 00:32:20,196
I should sink
a well down here and retire.

440
00:32:36,785 --> 00:32:38,218
Give me the lighter.

441
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:49,989
Oh, rats.

442
00:32:50,065 --> 00:32:51,089
Ugh!

443
00:33:05,948 --> 00:33:07,677
Come on.

444
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:57,662
Come here.

445
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,704
Look, it...

446
00:34:07,776 --> 00:34:08,868
it must be one of these.

447
00:34:08,944 --> 00:34:10,104
Look at the artistry

448
00:34:10,212 --> 00:34:13,773
of these carvings,
and the scrollwork.

449
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:31,329
It's this one.

450
00:34:46,448 --> 00:34:48,143
This is it.

451
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,615
We found it.

452
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:53,045
Look.

453
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,681
The engraving on the shield,

454
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:59,852
it's the same
as on the Grail tablet.

455
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:03,194
The shield is the second marker.

456
00:35:03,265 --> 00:35:04,755
What's that?

457
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:06,767
It's a rubbing

458
00:35:06,835 --> 00:35:09,770
Dad made
of the Grail tablet.

459
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,398
Just like your father--
giddy as a schoolboy.

460
00:35:13,508 --> 00:35:15,032
Wouldn't it be wonderful

461
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,169
if he were here now
to see this?

462
00:35:18,747 --> 00:35:20,874
He never would have
made it past the rats.

463
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:22,109
He hates rats.

464
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,514
He's scared to death of them.

465
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,905
Get back!

466
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:48,533
Back against the wall.

467
00:35:53,315 --> 00:35:54,111
Quick! Under it!

468
00:35:54,182 --> 00:35:55,547
Air pocket!

469
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:02,622
Don't wander off.

470
00:36:02,691 --> 00:36:03,715
What?

471
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:05,020
What?!

472
00:36:23,945 --> 00:36:25,606
I think I've found
a way out.

473
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,147
Deep breath.

474
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:46,627
Ah, Venice.

475
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:19,930
Whoa!

476
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:54,859
Are you crazy?!
Don't go between them!

477
00:37:54,936 --> 00:37:57,837
Go between them?
Are you crazy?!

478
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,240
I said go around!

479
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:12,081
You said
go between them!

480
00:38:12,187 --> 00:38:14,348
I said,
don't go between them!

481
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:18,581
No!

482
00:39:23,858 --> 00:39:25,883
Why are you
trying to kill us?

483
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:27,519
Because you're looking
for the Holy Grail.

484
00:39:27,596 --> 00:39:29,826
My father was looking
for the Holy Grail.

485
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:31,024
Did you kill him too?

486
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:32,031
No.

487
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,829
Where is he?

488
00:39:33,902 --> 00:39:36,370
Talk or you're dead.

489
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:38,030
Damn it, tell me!

490
00:39:38,106 --> 00:39:39,334
Tell me!

491
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:42,035
If you don't let go, Dr.Jones,
we'll both die.

492
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,101
Then we'll die.

493
00:39:44,245 --> 00:39:47,214
My soul is prepared.
How's yours?

494
00:39:48,883 --> 00:39:50,441
This is your last chance.

495
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:53,510
No, Dr.Jones, it's yours.

496
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,903
All right, where's my father?

497
00:40:11,973 --> 00:40:14,737
If you let me go,
I will tell you where he is.

498
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:16,674
Who are you?

499
00:40:16,745 --> 00:40:18,679
My name is Kazim.

500
00:40:18,747 --> 00:40:20,237
And why were you
trying to kill me?

501
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:22,044
The secret of the Grail

502
00:40:22,117 --> 00:40:24,449
has been safe
for a thousand years,

503
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:26,419
and for all that time,

504
00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:28,956
the Brotherhood of
the Cruciform Sword

505
00:40:29,024 --> 00:40:33,825
have been prepared
to do anything to keep it safe.

506
00:40:35,163 --> 00:40:37,097
Let me off
at this jetty.

507
00:40:40,235 --> 00:40:44,604
Ask yourself, why do you
seek the Cup of Christ?

508
00:40:44,673 --> 00:40:48,006
Is it for His glory,
or for yours?

509
00:40:48,076 --> 00:40:50,704
I didn't come
for the Cup of Christ.

510
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:52,679
I came to find my father.

511
00:40:52,747 --> 00:40:56,148
In that case,
God be with you in your quest.

512
00:40:56,217 --> 00:40:59,084
Your father is being held
in the Castle of Brunwald,

513
00:40:59,154 --> 00:41:01,520
on the Austrian-German border.

514
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:11,630
How's the head?

515
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,430
It's better,
now I've seen this.

516
00:41:14,502 --> 00:41:16,766
It's the name of a city.

517
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:18,396
"Alexandretta"?

518
00:41:19,674 --> 00:41:21,073
Hmm...

519
00:41:21,142 --> 00:41:23,007
The knights of the First Crusade

520
00:41:23,078 --> 00:41:26,275
laid siege to the city
of Alexandretta for over a year.

521
00:41:26,347 --> 00:41:28,975
The entire city was destroyed.

522
00:41:30,985 --> 00:41:34,682
The present city of Iskenderun
is built on its ruins.

523
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:38,888
Marcus, you remember
what the Grail tablet said:

524
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,428
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

525
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:43,623
to the Canyon
of the Crescent Moon."

526
00:41:46,668 --> 00:41:48,795
But where exactly?

527
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,531
Your father would know.

528
00:41:50,605 --> 00:41:51,537
Mm.

529
00:41:51,606 --> 00:41:54,040
Your father did know.

530
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:55,633
Look. He made a map.

531
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,473
He must have
pieced it together

532
00:41:57,545 --> 00:41:58,876
from clues
scattered through

533
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:00,744
the whole history
of the Grail quest.

534
00:42:00,815 --> 00:42:01,941
A map with no names.

535
00:42:02,016 --> 00:42:03,677
Now, he knew there
was a city

536
00:42:03,752 --> 00:42:05,447
with an oasis
due east, here.

537
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,509
He knew the course

538
00:42:06,588 --> 00:42:08,385
turned south through
the desert to a river,

539
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:10,287
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

540
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:11,825
Straight to the canyon.

541
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:14,361
He knew everything
except where to begin,

542
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:16,056
the name of the city.

543
00:42:18,032 --> 00:42:19,590
Alexandretta.

544
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:20,656
Now we know.

545
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:22,134
Yes. Now we know.

546
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,635
Marcus, get hold of Sallah.

547
00:42:23,705 --> 00:42:25,104
Tell him to meet you
in Iskenderun.

548
00:42:25,173 --> 00:42:26,140
What about you?

549
00:42:26,207 --> 00:42:27,606
I'm going after Dad.

550
00:42:48,997 --> 00:42:50,965
Elsa?

551
00:42:56,137 --> 00:42:59,072
Elsa? Elsa?

552
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,937
Oh! Oh...

553
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:10,581
My room...

554
00:43:10,652 --> 00:43:12,415
Mine, too.

555
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:14,250
What were they
looking for?

556
00:43:14,322 --> 00:43:15,789
This.

557
00:43:15,857 --> 00:43:17,347
The Grail diary?

558
00:43:17,425 --> 00:43:18,949
Uh-huh.

559
00:43:19,027 --> 00:43:20,824
You had it?

560
00:43:20,895 --> 00:43:22,726
You didn't trust me.

561
00:43:22,797 --> 00:43:24,788
I didn't know you.

562
00:43:24,866 --> 00:43:27,733
At least I let you tag along.

563
00:43:27,802 --> 00:43:28,996
Oh, yes.

564
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,903
Give them a flower,
and they'll follow you anywhere.

565
00:43:33,308 --> 00:43:35,299
Knock it off. You're not mad.

566
00:43:35,376 --> 00:43:36,843
No?

567
00:43:36,911 --> 00:43:39,141
No. You like
the way I do things.

568
00:43:39,247 --> 00:43:42,273
It's lucky I don't do
things the same way.

569
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,978
You'd still be standing
at the Venice pier!

570
00:43:45,053 --> 00:43:47,578
Look, what do you think
is going on here?

571
00:43:47,655 --> 00:43:50,681
Since I met you,
I've nearly been incinerated,

572
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:53,556
drowned, shot at,
and chopped into fish bait.

573
00:43:53,628 --> 00:43:56,153
We're caught in the middle
of something sinister here.

574
00:43:56,231 --> 00:43:58,859
My guess is Dad found out
more than he was looking for.

575
00:43:58,933 --> 00:43:59,865
And until I'm sure,

576
00:43:59,934 --> 00:44:01,492
I'm going to
continue to do things

577
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:03,366
the way I think
they should be done.

578
00:44:06,808 --> 00:44:10,005
How dare you kiss me!

579
00:44:15,383 --> 00:44:18,716
Leave me alone.
I don't like fast women.

580
00:44:18,786 --> 00:44:20,253
And I hate...

581
00:44:20,321 --> 00:44:23,722
arrogant men.

582
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,691
Ah, Venice.

583
00:45:06,768 --> 00:45:09,100
What do you know
about this place?

584
00:45:09,203 --> 00:45:12,604
I know the Brunwalds
are famous art collectors.

585
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:15,936
What are you going to do?

586
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:17,102
Don't know.

587
00:45:17,178 --> 00:45:18,475
I'll think of something.

588
00:45:26,387 --> 00:45:27,718
Yes?

589
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:29,450
And not before time!

590
00:45:29,524 --> 00:45:30,582
Did you intend to leave us

591
00:45:30,658 --> 00:45:31,989
standing on
the doorstep all day?

592
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,027
We're drenched!

593
00:45:34,762 --> 00:45:36,889
Now look, I've gone
and caught a sniffle.

594
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:38,057
Are you expected?

595
00:45:38,132 --> 00:45:40,464
Do not take that tone
with me, my good man.

596
00:45:40,535 --> 00:45:42,560
Now buttle off
and tell Baron Brunwald

597
00:45:42,637 --> 00:45:45,765
that Lord Clarence MacDonald
and his lovely assistant...

598
00:45:47,108 --> 00:45:49,372
...are here to view
the tapestries.

599
00:45:49,444 --> 00:45:50,502
Tapestries?

600
00:45:50,578 --> 00:45:52,273
Dear me,
the man is dense.

601
00:45:52,347 --> 00:45:54,144
This is a castle,
isn't it?

602
00:45:54,215 --> 00:45:55,648
There are tapestries?

603
00:45:55,717 --> 00:45:57,810
This is a castle,

604
00:45:57,885 --> 00:46:00,479
and we have
many tapestries.

605
00:46:00,555 --> 00:46:03,023
But if you are
a Scottish lord,

606
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:06,026
then I am Mickey Mouse!

607
00:46:06,094 --> 00:46:08,187
How dare he?

608
00:46:34,255 --> 00:46:37,588
Nazis. I hate these guys.

609
00:46:50,438 --> 00:46:52,599
This one. I think
he's in here.

610
00:46:52,673 --> 00:46:53,799
How do you know?

611
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:55,968
Because it's wired.

612
00:47:23,871 --> 00:47:26,339
Indy? Indy?

613
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:29,240
Don't worry...
this is kid's play.

614
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:30,971
I'll be right back.

615
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:56,497
Junior?

616
00:47:56,571 --> 00:47:58,869
Yes, sir.

617
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,271
It is you, Junior!

618
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:02,434
Don't call me that,
please.

619
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,842
Well, what are you
doing here?

620
00:48:04,912 --> 00:48:06,539
I came to get you.
What do you thi...?

621
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:19,817
Late 14th century,
Ming dynasty.

622
00:48:19,894 --> 00:48:22,260
Oh, it breaks the heart.

623
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,924
And the head.
You hit me, Dad.

624
00:48:24,999 --> 00:48:27,297
I'll never forgive myself.

625
00:48:27,368 --> 00:48:29,768
Don't worry, I'm fine.

626
00:48:29,837 --> 00:48:32,032
Thank God.

627
00:48:35,009 --> 00:48:38,001
It's fake.

628
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,413
See, you can tell
by the cross section.

629
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:43,578
No!

630
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:44,777
Dad, get your stuff.

631
00:48:44,852 --> 00:48:46,479
We've got to get
out of here.

632
00:48:46,554 --> 00:48:48,852
Well, I'm sorry about
your head, though,

633
00:48:48,923 --> 00:48:50,948
but I thought you
were one of them.

634
00:48:51,025 --> 00:48:53,516
Dad, they come in
through the doors.

635
00:48:54,562 --> 00:48:55,586
Good point.

636
00:48:55,663 --> 00:48:58,063
But better safe
than sorry.

637
00:48:58,132 --> 00:48:59,997
Hmm, so I was wrong this time.

638
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:03,503
But, by God, I wasn't wrong
when I mailed you my diary.

639
00:49:03,571 --> 00:49:04,868
You obviously got it.

640
00:49:06,807 --> 00:49:09,367
I got it, and I used it.

641
00:49:09,443 --> 00:49:12,879
We found the entrance
to the catacombs.

642
00:49:12,947 --> 00:49:14,414
Through the library?

643
00:49:14,482 --> 00:49:16,382
Right.

644
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,445
I knew it.

645
00:49:21,522 --> 00:49:23,080
And the tomb of Sir Richard?

646
00:49:23,157 --> 00:49:25,785
Found it.

647
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,125
He was actually there?

648
00:49:30,998 --> 00:49:32,590
You saw him?

649
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:35,636
Well, what was
left of him.

650
00:49:35,703 --> 00:49:37,568
And his shield...

651
00:49:37,638 --> 00:49:42,075
the inscription on
Sir Richard's shield?

652
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,111
"Alexandretta."

653
00:49:44,212 --> 00:49:46,476
Alexandretta! Of course!

654
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:50,779
On the pilgrim trail
from the Eastern Empire.

655
00:49:50,851 --> 00:49:51,818
Oh...

656
00:49:51,886 --> 00:49:55,788
Junior, you did it.

657
00:49:55,856 --> 00:49:58,120
No, Dad. You did.

658
00:49:58,192 --> 00:49:59,819
Forty years.

659
00:49:59,894 --> 00:50:03,022
Oh, if only I could have been
with you.

660
00:50:03,097 --> 00:50:04,928
There were rats,
Dad.

661
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:06,296
Rats?

662
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:07,629
Yeah, big ones.

663
00:50:07,702 --> 00:50:10,296
What do the Nazis
want with you, Dad?

664
00:50:10,371 --> 00:50:11,531
They wanted my diary.

665
00:50:11,606 --> 00:50:12,937
Yeah?

666
00:50:13,007 --> 00:50:16,408
I knew I had to get that book
as far away from me

667
00:50:16,477 --> 00:50:17,910
as I possibly could.

668
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,839
Yeah.

669
00:50:26,087 --> 00:50:27,748
Dr.Jones.

670
00:50:27,822 --> 00:50:29,119
Yes?

671
00:50:31,626 --> 00:50:33,924
I will take the book now.

672
00:50:33,995 --> 00:50:37,453
What book?

673
00:50:37,531 --> 00:50:39,931
You have the diary
in your pocket.

674
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:43,596
You dolt!

675
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:45,605
Do you think my son
would be that stupid

676
00:50:45,673 --> 00:50:47,641
that he would
bring my diary

677
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:49,300
all the way back here?

678
00:50:50,378 --> 00:50:52,005
You didn't, did you?

679
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,445
You didn't bring it,
did you?

680
00:50:54,515 --> 00:50:55,447
Well, uh...

681
00:50:55,516 --> 00:50:57,347
You did.

682
00:50:57,418 --> 00:50:59,386
Look, can we
discuss this later?

683
00:50:59,453 --> 00:51:01,444
I should have mailed it
to the Marx Brothers.

684
00:51:01,522 --> 00:51:03,456
Will you take it easy?

685
00:51:03,524 --> 00:51:04,821
Take it easy?!

686
00:51:04,892 --> 00:51:05,881
Why do you think
I sent it home

687
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,892
in the first place?

688
00:51:06,961 --> 00:51:08,394
So it wouldn't fall
into their hands!

689
00:51:08,462 --> 00:51:10,555
I came here
to save you!

690
00:51:10,631 --> 00:51:11,563
Oh, yeah?

691
00:51:11,632 --> 00:51:14,328
And who's gonna come
to save you, Junior?

692
00:51:14,402 --> 00:51:15,460
I told you...

693
00:51:22,443 --> 00:51:24,877
...don't call me Junior!

694
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,140
Look what you did!

695
00:51:31,118 --> 00:51:33,211
I can't believe what you did...

696
00:51:34,722 --> 00:51:37,657
Elsa? Elsa?

697
00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:40,319
That's far enough.
Put down the gun, Dr.Jones.

698
00:51:40,394 --> 00:51:41,656
Put down the gun,
or the fraulein dies.

699
00:51:41,729 --> 00:51:42,661
But she's one of them.

700
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,027
Indy, please!

701
00:51:44,098 --> 00:51:45,030
She's a Nazi.

702
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:46,031
What?!

703
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:46,725
Trust me.

704
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:48,496
- Indy, no!
- I will kill her!

705
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:49,900
Yeah? Go ahead!

706
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:51,164
No! Don't shoot!

707
00:51:51,238 --> 00:51:53,399
Don't worry. He won't.

708
00:51:53,474 --> 00:51:55,499
Indy, please! Do what he says!

709
00:51:55,576 --> 00:51:58,067
And don't listen to her.

710
00:51:58,145 --> 00:52:00,010
Enough! She dies!

711
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:03,448
Wait! Wait...

712
00:52:08,789 --> 00:52:10,723
I'm sorry.

713
00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:14,852
No, don't be.

714
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,237
But... you should have
listened to your father.

715
00:52:47,528 --> 00:52:49,428
She ransacked her own room,

716
00:52:49,497 --> 00:52:51,294
and I fell for it.

717
00:52:51,365 --> 00:52:54,562
How did you know
she was a Nazi?

718
00:52:54,635 --> 00:52:55,567
Hmm?

719
00:52:55,636 --> 00:52:58,628
How did you know
she was a Nazi?

720
00:52:58,706 --> 00:53:01,334
She talks in her sleep.

721
00:53:10,818 --> 00:53:13,582
I didn't trust her.
Why did you?

722
00:53:13,654 --> 00:53:16,248
Because he didn't
take my advice.

723
00:53:22,563 --> 00:53:24,997
Donovan.

724
00:53:25,065 --> 00:53:26,362
Didn't I warn you

725
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:28,868
not to trust anybody,
Dr.Jones?

726
00:53:28,936 --> 00:53:30,870
I misjudged you, Walter.

727
00:53:30,938 --> 00:53:34,396
I knew you would sell your
mother for an Etruscan vase,

728
00:53:34,475 --> 00:53:36,466
but I didn't know
you would sell

729
00:53:36,544 --> 00:53:38,136
your country
and your soul

730
00:53:38,212 --> 00:53:40,146
to the slime
of humanity.

731
00:53:40,247 --> 00:53:43,808
Dr.Schneider...

732
00:53:43,884 --> 00:53:46,079
there are pages
torn out of this.

733
00:53:54,462 --> 00:53:57,431
This book contained a map,
a map with no names,

734
00:53:57,498 --> 00:54:00,023
precise directions
from the unknown city

735
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,762
to the secret Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.

736
00:54:02,837 --> 00:54:04,099
So it did.

737
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:06,036
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

738
00:54:06,106 --> 00:54:08,040
We must have
these pages back.

739
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:09,370
You're wasting
your breath.

740
00:54:09,443 --> 00:54:10,637
He won't tell us,

741
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:13,009
and he doesn't have to.

742
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,016
It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

743
00:54:17,084 --> 00:54:19,109
He's given them
to Marcus Brody.

744
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,118
Marcus?

745
00:54:20,254 --> 00:54:22,552
You didn't drag poor
Marcus along, did you?

746
00:54:22,623 --> 00:54:24,113
He's not up
to the challenge.

747
00:54:24,225 --> 00:54:26,125
He sticks out
like a sore thumb.

748
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,488
We'll find him.

749
00:54:27,561 --> 00:54:28,721
The hell you will.

750
00:54:28,796 --> 00:54:30,491
He's got a two-day
head start on you,

751
00:54:30,564 --> 00:54:31,861
which is more
than he needs.

752
00:54:31,932 --> 00:54:34,264
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

753
00:54:34,335 --> 00:54:35,563
from here to the Sudan.

754
00:54:35,636 --> 00:54:38,503
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

755
00:54:38,572 --> 00:54:40,062
He'll blend in, disappear.

756
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,698
You'll never see him again.

757
00:54:41,775 --> 00:54:45,677
With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.

758
00:54:45,813 --> 00:54:47,838
Does anyone here
speak English?

759
00:54:47,915 --> 00:54:48,904
Or even ancient Greek?

760
00:54:48,983 --> 00:54:50,416
Uh, water?
No, thank you, sir.

761
00:54:50,484 --> 00:54:51,849
No. Fish make love in it.

762
00:54:51,919 --> 00:54:53,113
Goodness me.

763
00:54:53,187 --> 00:54:54,119
Thank you so much.

764
00:54:54,188 --> 00:54:55,155
No, I don't like that.

765
00:54:55,256 --> 00:54:56,314
No, I really don't want...

766
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:57,982
No, no, thank you very much.

767
00:54:58,058 --> 00:55:00,754
No, thank you, madam.
I'm a vegetarian.

768
00:55:00,828 --> 00:55:04,093
Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?

769
00:55:04,164 --> 00:55:05,324
Mr.Brody!

770
00:55:05,399 --> 00:55:06,923
Oh, Sallah.
What a relief.

771
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:09,094
Marcus Brody, sir.

772
00:55:09,236 --> 00:55:10,203
But where is Indy?

773
00:55:10,271 --> 00:55:11,238
Oh, he's in Austria.

774
00:55:11,305 --> 00:55:12,272
A slight detour.

775
00:55:12,339 --> 00:55:13,670
You are on your own?

776
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:14,867
Yes, but don't panic.

777
00:55:14,942 --> 00:55:16,466
Everything's under control.

778
00:55:16,544 --> 00:55:18,637
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

779
00:55:18,712 --> 00:55:19,644
Oh, yes,
of course.

780
00:55:19,713 --> 00:55:20,839
But where
are we going?

781
00:55:20,915 --> 00:55:22,109
Oh, this map will show you.

782
00:55:22,249 --> 00:55:24,012
It was drawn by, uh...

783
00:55:24,084 --> 00:55:26,052
Mr.Brody.

784
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,111
Welcome to Iskenderun.

785
00:55:28,188 --> 00:55:30,122
The director
of the Museum of Antiquities

786
00:55:30,257 --> 00:55:31,417
has sent a car for you.

787
00:55:31,492 --> 00:55:33,756
Oh, well...
your servant, sir.

788
00:55:33,827 --> 00:55:35,124
And I am his.

789
00:55:35,229 --> 00:55:37,254
Follow me, please.

790
00:55:37,331 --> 00:55:39,322
My reputation precedes me.

791
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,129
There is no museum
in Iskenderun.

792
00:55:41,268 --> 00:55:42,735
Papers, please.

793
00:55:42,803 --> 00:55:43,770
Papers?

794
00:55:43,837 --> 00:55:44,861
Of course.

795
00:55:44,939 --> 00:55:45,997
Run.

796
00:55:46,073 --> 00:55:47,005
Yes.

797
00:55:47,074 --> 00:55:48,507
Papers. Got it here.

798
00:55:48,576 --> 00:55:50,134
Just finished
reading it myself.

799
00:55:50,277 --> 00:55:51,244
Run.

800
00:55:51,312 --> 00:55:52,244
Yes.

801
00:55:52,313 --> 00:55:53,974
"Egyptian Mail,"
morning edition.

802
00:55:54,048 --> 00:55:55,015
Run.

803
00:55:55,082 --> 00:55:56,014
Did you say, uh...

804
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:56,708
Run!

805
00:56:12,466 --> 00:56:14,024
Okay, okay,
quick, quick, quick!

806
00:56:14,101 --> 00:56:15,932
Find the back door!
Find the back door!

807
00:56:30,684 --> 00:56:32,049
Intolerable.

808
00:56:35,089 --> 00:56:36,920
Dr.Schneider.
Message from Berlin.

809
00:56:36,991 --> 00:56:38,549
You must return immediately.

810
00:56:38,626 --> 00:56:40,685
A rally at the Institute
of Aryan Culture.

811
00:56:40,761 --> 00:56:41,750
So?

812
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:43,091
Your presence
on the platform

813
00:56:43,163 --> 00:56:45,495
is requested
at the highest level.

814
00:56:45,566 --> 00:56:47,124
Thank you, Herr Oberst.

815
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:48,757
I will meet you
at Iskenderun.

816
00:56:48,836 --> 00:56:49,768
Take this diary

817
00:56:49,837 --> 00:56:51,031
to the Reichmuseum
in Berlin.

818
00:56:51,105 --> 00:56:52,402
It will show them
our progress,

819
00:56:52,473 --> 00:56:53,405
ahead of schedule.

820
00:56:53,474 --> 00:56:54,441
Without the map,

821
00:56:54,508 --> 00:56:56,066
I'm afraid it's no
better than a souvenir.

822
00:56:56,143 --> 00:56:57,303
Let me kill them now.

823
00:56:57,378 --> 00:56:58,345
No.

824
00:56:58,412 --> 00:57:00,676
If we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,

825
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:01,942
we'll need them alive.

826
00:57:02,016 --> 00:57:04,382
Always do what
the doctor orders.

827
00:57:12,526 --> 00:57:14,050
Don't look at me like that.

828
00:57:14,128 --> 00:57:16,221
We both wanted the Grail.

829
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:19,288
I would have done
anything to get it.

830
00:57:19,366 --> 00:57:20,594
You would have
done the same.

831
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:23,159
I'm sorry you think so.

832
00:57:33,514 --> 00:57:36,847
I can't forget
how wonderful it was.

833
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:38,384
Thank you.

834
00:57:38,452 --> 00:57:40,477
It was rather wonderful.

835
00:57:49,697 --> 00:57:51,790
Oh, Dr.Schneider.

836
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:54,857
Your car is waiting.

837
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:05,110
That's how Austrians
say good-bye.

838
00:58:11,151 --> 00:58:14,985
And this is how we say good-bye
in Germany, Dr.Jones.

839
00:58:16,523 --> 00:58:17,990
Oh!

840
00:58:23,263 --> 00:58:25,254
I liked the Austrian way
better.

841
00:58:25,332 --> 00:58:26,959
So did l.

842
00:58:27,034 --> 00:58:28,899
Let's try and get
these ropes loose.

843
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:31,494
We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do.

844
00:58:31,572 --> 00:58:33,733
You said he had
two days' start.

845
00:58:33,807 --> 00:58:35,672
That he would blend in.
Disappear.

846
00:58:35,743 --> 00:58:37,438
Are you kidding?
I made that up.

847
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:38,443
You know Marcus.

848
00:58:38,512 --> 00:58:40,070
He got lost once
in his own museum.

849
00:58:40,147 --> 00:58:41,273
Oh...

850
00:58:41,348 --> 00:58:45,307
Can you try and reach
my left jacket pocket?

851
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,117
What am I looking for?

852
00:58:48,188 --> 00:58:49,712
My lucky charm.

853
00:58:51,258 --> 00:58:52,850
Feels like
a cigarette lighter.

854
00:58:54,061 --> 00:58:55,722
Try and burn
through the ropes.

855
00:58:55,796 --> 00:58:58,765
Very good.

856
00:59:03,137 --> 00:59:04,195
Oh!

857
00:59:23,457 --> 00:59:24,685
I ought to tell you something.

858
00:59:24,758 --> 00:59:26,020
Don't get
sentimental now Dad.

859
00:59:26,093 --> 00:59:27,492
Save it till
we get out of here.

860
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:29,290
The floor's on fire.

861
00:59:29,363 --> 00:59:31,024
- See?
- What?

862
00:59:31,098 --> 00:59:32,759
And the chair.

863
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:34,198
Move! Move it out of here!

864
00:59:34,268 --> 00:59:35,292
Go!

865
00:59:35,369 --> 00:59:37,269
It's scorching the table!
Fast!

866
00:59:37,337 --> 00:59:38,304
- Move!
- Okay!

867
00:59:52,219 --> 00:59:54,278
Well, we have Marcus Brody,

868
00:59:54,354 --> 00:59:57,289
but more important,
we have the map.

869
01:00:01,695 --> 01:00:03,492
"By the personal command
of the Fuhrer.

870
01:00:03,564 --> 01:00:05,122
"Secrecy essential to success.

871
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:07,895
Eliminate the American
conspirators."

872
01:00:07,968 --> 01:00:11,768
Germany has declared war
on the Jones boys.

873
01:00:17,444 --> 01:00:18,376
- Dad!
- What?

874
01:00:18,445 --> 01:00:19,377
Dad!

875
01:00:19,446 --> 01:00:20,378
What?

876
01:00:20,447 --> 01:00:21,379
- Dad!
- What?

877
01:00:21,448 --> 01:00:22,642
Head for the fireplace!

878
01:00:22,716 --> 01:00:23,705
Oh.

879
01:00:35,729 --> 01:00:37,788
I think I can get
these ropes off.

880
01:00:38,999 --> 01:00:39,988
Whoops.

881
01:00:50,711 --> 01:00:53,839
Our situation has not improved.

882
01:00:53,914 --> 01:00:55,814
Listen, Dad, I'm almost free.

883
01:01:10,964 --> 01:01:12,295
Alarm!

884
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:23,002
This is intolerable.

885
01:01:24,244 --> 01:01:25,541
I'm out, Dad.

886
01:01:25,612 --> 01:01:27,637
Well done, boy.

887
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:04,649
Come on, Dad.

888
01:02:10,991 --> 01:02:12,618
Dead end.

889
01:02:12,693 --> 01:02:14,251
There's got to be a...

890
01:02:14,328 --> 01:02:16,125
a secret door or a...

891
01:02:16,263 --> 01:02:18,697
passageway
or something.

892
01:02:18,765 --> 01:02:22,030
I find that if I just
sit down and think...

893
01:02:24,671 --> 01:02:26,263
Dad!

894
01:02:30,177 --> 01:02:32,475
...the solution presents itself.

895
01:02:40,387 --> 01:02:42,651
Great. More boats.

896
01:02:45,692 --> 01:02:46,954
You say this has been

897
01:02:47,027 --> 01:02:49,427
just another typical
day for you, huh?

898
01:02:51,164 --> 01:02:54,292
No! But better than most.

899
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:58,604
Come on, Dad. Come on.

900
01:02:58,672 --> 01:03:00,003
What about the boat?

901
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:02,098
We're not going on the boat?

902
01:03:17,257 --> 01:03:18,246
Jones!

903
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:32,061
Halt! Halt!

904
01:05:34,895 --> 01:05:36,226
- Stop!
- What?

905
01:05:36,296 --> 01:05:38,025
Stop! Stop!

906
01:05:38,098 --> 01:05:39,895
You're going the wrong way.

907
01:05:39,966 --> 01:05:41,661
We have to get to Berlin.

908
01:05:41,735 --> 01:05:43,760
Brody's this way.

909
01:05:43,837 --> 01:05:45,634
My diary's in Berlin.

910
01:05:45,705 --> 01:05:47,969
We don't
need the diary, Dad.

911
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:49,599
Marcus has the map.

912
01:05:49,676 --> 01:05:52,839
There is more in the diary
than just the map.

913
01:05:54,014 --> 01:05:56,342
All right, Dad. Tell me.

914
01:05:56,342 --> 01:06:02,076
Well, he who finds the Grail
must face the final challenge.

915
01:06:02,148 --> 01:06:03,581
What final challenge?

916
01:06:03,649 --> 01:06:06,812
Three devices
of such lethal cunning.

917
01:06:06,886 --> 01:06:08,046
Booby traps?

918
01:06:08,121 --> 01:06:09,418
Oh, yes.

919
01:06:09,489 --> 01:06:12,890
But I found the clues that
will safely take us through,

920
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:15,189
in the Chronicles
of St. Anselm.

921
01:06:15,261 --> 01:06:17,661
Well, what are they?

922
01:06:21,234 --> 01:06:22,599
Can't you remember?

923
01:06:24,303 --> 01:06:25,827
I wrote them down in my diary

924
01:06:25,905 --> 01:06:28,430
so that I wouldn't have
to remember.

925
01:06:28,508 --> 01:06:30,237
Half the German army's
on our tail,

926
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:32,004
and you want me to go
to Berlin?

927
01:06:32,078 --> 01:06:33,102
Into the lion's den?

928
01:06:33,179 --> 01:06:34,168
Yes.

929
01:06:34,247 --> 01:06:36,147
The only thing that matters
is the Grail.

930
01:06:36,215 --> 01:06:37,580
What about Marcus?

931
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:39,641
Marcus would agree with me.

932
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:42,187
Two selfless martyrs.

933
01:06:42,255 --> 01:06:44,155
Jesus Christ.

934
01:06:47,326 --> 01:06:48,884
That's for blasphemy.

935
01:06:52,064 --> 01:06:57,559
The quest for the Grail
is not archaeology.

936
01:06:57,637 --> 01:07:00,197
It's a race against evil.

937
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:04,004
If it is captured by the Nazis,
the armies of darkness

938
01:07:04,076 --> 01:07:06,544
will march all over
the face of the Earth.

939
01:07:06,612 --> 01:07:08,011
Do you understand me?

940
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:11,847
This is an obsession, Dad.

941
01:07:11,918 --> 01:07:13,977
I never understood it.

942
01:07:14,053 --> 01:07:15,452
Never.

943
01:07:17,256 --> 01:07:18,848
Neither did Mom.

944
01:07:18,925 --> 01:07:20,916
Oh, yes, she did.

945
01:07:20,993 --> 01:07:22,961
Only too well.

946
01:07:23,029 --> 01:07:28,433
Unfortunately, she kept
her illness from me

947
01:07:28,501 --> 01:07:31,129
until all I could do
was mourn her.

948
01:08:33,766 --> 01:08:37,361
My boy, we are pilgrims
in an unholy land.

949
01:09:06,832 --> 01:09:08,823
Fraulein Doctor.

950
01:09:08,901 --> 01:09:10,027
Where is it?

951
01:09:10,102 --> 01:09:11,194
How did you get here?

952
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,430
Where is it?

953
01:09:12,505 --> 01:09:14,871
I want it.

954
01:09:16,275 --> 01:09:19,210
You came back for the book? Why?

955
01:09:19,345 --> 01:09:21,210
My father didn't want
it incinerated.

956
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,805
Is that
what you think of me?

957
01:09:23,883 --> 01:09:25,680
I believe in the Grail,
not the swastika.

958
01:09:25,751 --> 01:09:27,082
But you stood up to be counted

959
01:09:27,153 --> 01:09:29,644
with the enemy of everything
that the Grail stands for.

960
01:09:29,722 --> 01:09:31,656
Who gives a damn what you think?

961
01:09:31,724 --> 01:09:33,214
You do.

962
01:09:33,292 --> 01:09:37,023
All I have to
do is squeeze.

963
01:09:37,096 --> 01:09:39,360
All I have to do is scream.

964
01:09:48,574 --> 01:09:49,666
I've got it.

965
01:09:49,742 --> 01:09:51,710
Let's get the hell out of here.

966
01:11:03,849 --> 01:11:04,941
What did you get?

967
01:11:05,017 --> 01:11:06,143
I don't know.

968
01:11:06,218 --> 01:11:08,152
First available flight
out of Germany.

969
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:10,279
Good.

970
01:11:34,547 --> 01:11:37,812
Well, we made it.

971
01:11:37,883 --> 01:11:41,216
When we're airborne,
with Germany behind us,

972
01:11:41,287 --> 01:11:44,154
then I'll share
that sentiment.

973
01:11:44,223 --> 01:11:46,316
Relax.

974
01:12:31,003 --> 01:12:33,301
Tickets, please.

975
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:46,511
Guten Tag...

976
01:12:46,585 --> 01:12:48,314
Herr Jones.

977
01:12:51,891 --> 01:12:53,153
Tickets, please.

978
01:13:05,738 --> 01:13:07,706
Oh, we should
get out of here.

979
01:13:09,241 --> 01:13:11,004
No ticket.

980
01:13:13,712 --> 01:13:14,406
Ticket.

981
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,879
- Ticket!
- Ticket!

982
01:13:15,948 --> 01:13:17,347
- Ticket!
- Ticket!

983
01:13:34,633 --> 01:13:35,964
You know,

984
01:13:36,035 --> 01:13:40,438
sharing your adventures is
an interesting experience.

985
01:13:40,506 --> 01:13:42,770
That's not all we shared.

986
01:13:42,842 --> 01:13:44,275
It's disgraceful.

987
01:13:44,343 --> 01:13:46,038
You're old enough
to be her fa...

988
01:13:46,111 --> 01:13:47,373
her-her grandfather.

989
01:13:47,446 --> 01:13:49,414
Well, I'm as human
as the next man.

990
01:13:49,481 --> 01:13:51,449
I was the next man.

991
01:13:51,517 --> 01:13:52,643
Oh.

992
01:13:53,853 --> 01:13:55,445
Of course. Well...

993
01:13:55,521 --> 01:13:58,012
Ships that pass
in the night.

994
01:13:58,090 --> 01:14:01,526
Do you remember the last time
we had a quiet drink, hmm?

995
01:14:03,562 --> 01:14:04,893
I had a milkshake.

996
01:14:04,964 --> 01:14:06,898
Hmm?

997
01:14:06,966 --> 01:14:09,161
What did we
talk about?

998
01:14:09,235 --> 01:14:11,226
We didn't talk.

999
01:14:11,337 --> 01:14:13,703
We never talked.

1000
01:14:13,772 --> 01:14:18,607
Do I detect
a rebuke?

1001
01:14:18,677 --> 01:14:20,645
A regret.

1002
01:14:20,713 --> 01:14:22,203
It was just the two of us, Dad.

1003
01:14:22,281 --> 01:14:23,839
It was a lonely way to grow up.

1004
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:25,042
For you, too.

1005
01:14:25,117 --> 01:14:26,880
If you'd been an ordinary,
average father,

1006
01:14:26,952 --> 01:14:29,216
like the other guys' dads,
you'd have understood that.

1007
01:14:29,288 --> 01:14:32,382
Actually, I was
a wonderful father.

1008
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:34,426
When?

1009
01:14:34,493 --> 01:14:36,358
Did I ever tell
you to eat up?

1010
01:14:36,428 --> 01:14:38,020
Go to bed?
Wash your ears?

1011
01:14:38,097 --> 01:14:39,621
Do your homework? No.

1012
01:14:39,698 --> 01:14:41,495
I respected
your privacy,

1013
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:43,831
and I taught
you self-reliance.

1014
01:14:43,903 --> 01:14:44,927
What you taught me was

1015
01:14:45,004 --> 01:14:46,471
that I was
less important to you

1016
01:14:46,538 --> 01:14:47,937
than people
who'd been dead

1017
01:14:48,007 --> 01:14:49,565
for 500 years
in another country.

1018
01:14:49,642 --> 01:14:51,405
And I learned it so well

1019
01:14:51,477 --> 01:14:54,275
that we've hardly spoken
for 20 years.

1020
01:14:54,346 --> 01:14:56,610
You left just when you
were becoming interesting.

1021
01:14:56,682 --> 01:14:58,149
Unbelievable.

1022
01:14:58,217 --> 01:14:59,275
Dad, how can you...?

1023
01:14:59,385 --> 01:15:00,409
Very well.

1024
01:15:00,486 --> 01:15:02,920
I'm here now.

1025
01:15:02,988 --> 01:15:05,013
What do you want
to talk about?

1026
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:06,216
Hmm?

1027
01:15:06,358 --> 01:15:08,758
Well, l...

1028
01:15:10,729 --> 01:15:12,424
Uh...

1029
01:15:16,201 --> 01:15:18,465
I can't think of anything.

1030
01:15:18,537 --> 01:15:20,596
Then what are
you complaining about?

1031
01:15:22,241 --> 01:15:24,209
Look, we have work to do.

1032
01:15:25,878 --> 01:15:27,812
When we get to
Alexandretta,

1033
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,178
we will face
three challenges.

1034
01:15:30,249 --> 01:15:32,183
The first,

1035
01:15:32,251 --> 01:15:33,775
"The Breath of God.

1036
01:15:33,852 --> 01:15:36,116
Only the penitent
man will pass."

1037
01:15:36,188 --> 01:15:37,450
Second,

1038
01:15:37,523 --> 01:15:38,785
"The Word of God.

1039
01:15:38,857 --> 01:15:42,418
Only in the footsteps
of God will he proceed."

1040
01:15:42,494 --> 01:15:43,586
Third,

1041
01:15:43,662 --> 01:15:45,152
"The Path of God.

1042
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:47,255
"Only in the leap
from the lion's head

1043
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:49,893
will he prove his worth."

1044
01:15:52,004 --> 01:15:54,029
What does that mean?

1045
01:15:54,106 --> 01:15:56,040
I don't know.

1046
01:15:56,108 --> 01:15:57,541
We'll find out.

1047
01:16:04,049 --> 01:16:07,075
We're turning around.

1048
01:16:07,152 --> 01:16:09,586
They're taking us back
to Germany.

1049
01:16:15,661 --> 01:16:17,925
Well, I thought
it would take them a lot longer

1050
01:16:17,997 --> 01:16:19,328
to figure out
the radio was dead.

1051
01:16:19,398 --> 01:16:21,366
Come on, Dad. Move!

1052
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:27,368
Come on, Dad. Come on!

1053
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,447
I didn't know you
could fly a plane.

1054
01:16:43,522 --> 01:16:44,682
Fly, yes.

1055
01:16:46,925 --> 01:16:49,223
Land, no.

1056
01:17:12,751 --> 01:17:14,912
Dad, you're going to have
to use the machine gun.

1057
01:17:14,987 --> 01:17:17,182
Get it ready.

1058
01:17:17,256 --> 01:17:19,656
Eleven o'clock!

1059
01:17:19,725 --> 01:17:21,989
Dad, eleven o'clock!

1060
01:17:23,062 --> 01:17:25,530
What happens at eleven o'clock?

1061
01:17:25,597 --> 01:17:27,565
Twelve, eleven, ten.

1062
01:17:27,633 --> 01:17:29,601
Eleven o'clock, fire!

1063
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:58,154
Dad, are we hit?!

1064
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:00,255
More or less.

1065
01:18:00,332 --> 01:18:02,197
Son, I'm sorry.

1066
01:18:02,334 --> 01:18:04,427
They got us.

1067
01:18:06,405 --> 01:18:07,394
Hang on, Dad.

1068
01:18:07,473 --> 01:18:08,735
We're going in!

1069
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:22,546
Nice landing.

1070
01:18:22,621 --> 01:18:24,646
Thanks.

1071
01:18:39,071 --> 01:18:40,561
Those people are
trying to kill us!

1072
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,731
I know, Dad!

1073
01:18:41,807 --> 01:18:43,172
Well.

1074
01:18:43,242 --> 01:18:45,233
It's a new
experience for me.

1075
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:47,870
It happens to me all the time.

1076
01:19:18,343 --> 01:19:20,311
This is intolerable!

1077
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,045
This could be close.

1078
01:19:31,356 --> 01:19:33,916
Faster, boy! Faster!

1079
01:19:49,575 --> 01:19:51,941
Well, they don't come
any closer than that!

1080
01:20:07,759 --> 01:20:10,592
Dad, he's coming back!

1081
01:20:57,142 --> 01:20:59,702
I suddenly
remembered my Charlemagne.

1082
01:20:59,778 --> 01:21:02,679
"Let my armies be the rocks
and the trees

1083
01:21:02,748 --> 01:21:04,909
and the birds in the sky."

1084
01:21:22,434 --> 01:21:23,628
These pages are taken

1085
01:21:23,702 --> 01:21:26,193
from Professor Jones'
diary, Your Highness,

1086
01:21:26,271 --> 01:21:27,568
and they include a map

1087
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:30,403
that pinpoints the exact
location of the Grail.

1088
01:21:30,475 --> 01:21:33,069
As you can see, the Grail
is all but in our hands.

1089
01:21:33,145 --> 01:21:34,271
However, Your Highness,

1090
01:21:34,379 --> 01:21:36,438
we would not think
of crossing your soil

1091
01:21:36,515 --> 01:21:37,777
without your permission,

1092
01:21:37,849 --> 01:21:40,079
nor of removing the
Grail from your borders

1093
01:21:40,152 --> 01:21:43,121
without suitable
compensation.

1094
01:21:45,357 --> 01:21:47,484
What have you brought?

1095
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,000
Precious valuables,
Your Highness,

1096
01:21:58,070 --> 01:22:01,005
donated by some
of the finest families

1097
01:22:01,073 --> 01:22:03,132
in all of Germany.

1098
01:22:06,311 --> 01:22:07,642
Ah!

1099
01:22:07,713 --> 01:22:10,682
Rolls-Royce
Phantom Two.

1100
01:22:10,749 --> 01:22:12,239
Four-point-three liter,

1101
01:22:12,317 --> 01:22:14,842
30 horsepower,
six-cylinder engine,

1102
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:17,582
with Stromberg
downdraft carburetor.

1103
01:22:17,656 --> 01:22:21,183
Can go from zero to
100 kilometers an hour

1104
01:22:21,259 --> 01:22:23,591
in 12.5 seconds.

1105
01:22:23,662 --> 01:22:25,823
And I even
like the color.

1106
01:22:25,897 --> 01:22:29,298
The keys are in the ignition,
Your Highness.

1107
01:22:30,602 --> 01:22:33,093
You shall have
camels, horses,

1108
01:22:33,171 --> 01:22:35,105
an armed escort, provisions,

1109
01:22:35,173 --> 01:22:37,107
desert vehicles

1110
01:22:37,175 --> 01:22:38,369
and tanks.

1111
01:22:38,443 --> 01:22:40,411
You're welcome.

1112
01:22:55,994 --> 01:22:57,427
We have no time to lose.

1113
01:22:57,496 --> 01:23:00,124
Indiana Jones
and his father have escaped.

1114
01:23:02,868 --> 01:23:04,768
We go this way.

1115
01:23:04,836 --> 01:23:06,394
Get that camel
out of the way.

1116
01:23:08,874 --> 01:23:10,603
What happened
to Marcus, Sallah?

1117
01:23:10,675 --> 01:23:13,542
Ah, they set out across
the desert this afternoon.

1118
01:23:13,612 --> 01:23:16,445
I believe they took
Mr.Brody with them.

1119
01:23:17,883 --> 01:23:20,647
Now they have the map.

1120
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:23,347
And in this sort of race,

1121
01:23:23,422 --> 01:23:26,687
there's no silver medal
for finishing second.

1122
01:23:48,513 --> 01:23:51,243
Care to wet your
whistle, Marcus?

1123
01:23:51,316 --> 01:23:53,284
I'd rather spit
in your face.

1124
01:23:53,418 --> 01:23:55,511
But as I haven't
got any spit...

1125
01:23:58,190 --> 01:24:00,488
Must be within
three or four miles.

1126
01:24:00,559 --> 01:24:03,289
Otherwise we are
off the map.

1127
01:24:05,063 --> 01:24:07,793
Well, Marcus,
we are on the brink

1128
01:24:07,866 --> 01:24:09,993
of the recovery
of the greatest artifact

1129
01:24:10,068 --> 01:24:11,467
in the history
of mankind.

1130
01:24:11,536 --> 01:24:14,027
You're meddling with powers

1131
01:24:14,105 --> 01:24:16,972
you cannot
possibly comprehend.

1132
01:24:22,314 --> 01:24:24,942
Ah, I see Brody.

1133
01:24:25,016 --> 01:24:27,484
He seems okay.

1134
01:24:30,388 --> 01:24:31,980
They've got a tank.

1135
01:24:37,996 --> 01:24:39,588
Six-pound gun.

1136
01:24:39,664 --> 01:24:41,393
What do you think
you're doing there?

1137
01:24:41,466 --> 01:24:42,398
Get down!

1138
01:24:42,467 --> 01:24:45,061
Dad, we're well out of range.

1139
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,114
That car belonged
to my brother-in-law.

1140
01:24:57,182 --> 01:24:58,444
Come on, come on!

1141
01:24:58,517 --> 01:25:00,417
I can't see anyone up there.

1142
01:25:00,485 --> 01:25:02,214
Maybe it wasn't
even Jones.

1143
01:25:02,287 --> 01:25:03,845
No, it is him,
all right.

1144
01:25:03,922 --> 01:25:05,617
He's here somewhere.

1145
01:25:05,690 --> 01:25:08,420
Put Brody in the tank.

1146
01:25:16,134 --> 01:25:18,694
Well, in this sun,

1147
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:21,068
without transportation,
they're as good as dead.

1148
01:25:30,715 --> 01:25:32,376
It's Jones, all right.

1149
01:25:36,555 --> 01:25:38,045
Now, who are
all these people?

1150
01:25:38,123 --> 01:25:39,055
Who cares?

1151
01:25:39,124 --> 01:25:41,058
As long as they're
keeping Donovan busy.

1152
01:25:41,126 --> 01:25:42,923
Dad, you stay here
while Sallah and I

1153
01:25:42,994 --> 01:25:45,053
organize some transportation.

1154
01:26:09,588 --> 01:26:11,215
I'm going after those horses.

1155
01:26:11,289 --> 01:26:12,221
I'll take the camels.

1156
01:26:12,357 --> 01:26:13,324
I don't need camels.

1157
01:26:13,391 --> 01:26:14,323
But, Indy...

1158
01:26:14,392 --> 01:26:15,484
No camels.

1159
01:26:26,371 --> 01:26:27,838
Who is he?

1160
01:26:29,641 --> 01:26:32,576
A messenger from God.

1161
01:26:32,644 --> 01:26:35,010
For the unrighteous,

1162
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:39,449
the Cup of Life
holds everlasting damnation.

1163
01:26:57,869 --> 01:26:58,836
Marcus!

1164
01:26:59,871 --> 01:27:00,929
Oh.

1165
01:27:01,006 --> 01:27:04,134
"Genius of the Restoration..."

1166
01:27:04,209 --> 01:27:07,201
"Aid our own resuscitation."

1167
01:27:07,278 --> 01:27:08,540
Henry, what are you
doing here?

1168
01:27:08,613 --> 01:27:09,978
It's a rescue, old boy.
Come on.

1169
01:27:16,388 --> 01:27:17,582
Search him.

1170
01:27:17,656 --> 01:27:19,886
What is in this book?

1171
01:27:19,958 --> 01:27:23,519
That miserable
little diary of yours.

1172
01:27:23,595 --> 01:27:25,756
We have the map.
The book is useless.

1173
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:29,095
And yet you come all the way
back to Berlin to get it.

1174
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:30,225
Why?

1175
01:27:30,301 --> 01:27:33,202
What are you hiding?

1176
01:27:33,271 --> 01:27:34,932
What does the diary
tell you

1177
01:27:35,006 --> 01:27:37,736
that it doesn't
tell us?

1178
01:27:37,809 --> 01:27:41,245
It tells me that goose-stepping
morons like yourself

1179
01:27:41,379 --> 01:27:45,179
should try reading books
instead of burning them.

1180
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:46,740
Colonel!

1181
01:27:46,818 --> 01:27:48,217
Jones is getting away.

1182
01:27:48,286 --> 01:27:50,015
I think not,

1183
01:27:50,088 --> 01:27:51,385
Herr Donovan.

1184
01:27:51,456 --> 01:27:53,890
Not that Jones,
the other Jones!

1185
01:28:03,201 --> 01:28:05,863
Sallah, I said no camels!

1186
01:28:05,937 --> 01:28:07,063
That's five camels.

1187
01:28:07,138 --> 01:28:08,127
Can't you count?

1188
01:28:08,206 --> 01:28:10,436
Compensation for
my brother-in-law's car.

1189
01:28:10,508 --> 01:28:12,703
Indy, your father
and Brody...

1190
01:28:12,777 --> 01:28:14,176
Where's my father?

1191
01:28:14,245 --> 01:28:15,405
They have them.

1192
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:17,778
In the belly
of that steel beast.

1193
01:28:20,151 --> 01:28:21,880
Hyah!

1194
01:28:29,427 --> 01:28:30,917
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

1195
01:28:30,995 --> 01:28:32,587
Hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah!

1196
01:28:40,839 --> 01:28:41,965
Fire!

1197
01:30:42,594 --> 01:30:45,290
Dad! Dad!

1198
01:30:45,363 --> 01:30:46,227
Dad!

1199
01:30:46,297 --> 01:30:47,594
Junior?

1200
01:30:47,665 --> 01:30:49,132
Junior?!

1201
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:50,428
Junior!

1202
01:32:05,109 --> 01:32:06,599
Dad!

1203
01:32:08,413 --> 01:32:09,471
Dad!

1204
01:32:09,547 --> 01:32:11,276
Dad! Get out!

1205
01:33:31,329 --> 01:33:33,058
Henry, the pen...

1206
01:33:33,131 --> 01:33:34,758
- What?
- But don't you see?

1207
01:33:34,832 --> 01:33:38,063
The pen is mightier
than the sword.

1208
01:34:00,391 --> 01:34:01,949
Look what you did.

1209
01:34:02,026 --> 01:34:03,618
It's war.

1210
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:11,062
Didn't I tell you
it was a rescue, huh?

1211
01:35:15,399 --> 01:35:16,661
Dad!

1212
01:35:16,734 --> 01:35:18,531
Yeah?

1213
01:35:18,603 --> 01:35:20,434
You call this archaeology?

1214
01:35:20,505 --> 01:35:21,733
Get out of there, Dad.

1215
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,809
How does one
get off this thing?

1216
01:35:41,759 --> 01:35:42,817
Where's Marcus?

1217
01:35:46,664 --> 01:35:48,063
Dad!

1218
01:35:52,503 --> 01:35:53,663
Hang on, Dad!

1219
01:36:00,111 --> 01:36:02,602
Father of Indy,
give me your hand!

1220
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:04,443
Sallah!

1221
01:36:04,515 --> 01:36:05,880
Get Dad!

1222
01:36:05,950 --> 01:36:07,850
Give me your hand!

1223
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,129
Junior!

1224
01:37:00,271 --> 01:37:01,602
Indy!

1225
01:37:10,815 --> 01:37:13,045
Oh, God.

1226
01:37:13,117 --> 01:37:15,210
I've lost him.

1227
01:37:18,256 --> 01:37:23,057
And I never told him anything.

1228
01:37:23,127 --> 01:37:27,223
I just wasn't ready, Marcus.

1229
01:37:27,365 --> 01:37:31,301
Five minutes
would have been enough.

1230
01:38:06,971 --> 01:38:09,997
I thought
I'd lost you, boy!

1231
01:38:10,074 --> 01:38:13,840
I thought
you had too, sir.

1232
01:38:13,911 --> 01:38:16,539
Mmm...

1233
01:38:26,424 --> 01:38:30,224
Well...

1234
01:38:30,361 --> 01:38:33,228
Well done. Come on.

1235
01:38:35,833 --> 01:38:38,199
Let's go, then.

1236
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:41,661
Why are you
sitting there resting

1237
01:38:41,739 --> 01:38:43,536
when we're so near the end?!

1238
01:38:43,607 --> 01:38:45,871
Come on, let's go!

1239
01:38:57,822 --> 01:39:02,054
The Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.

1240
01:41:29,173 --> 01:41:30,834
Helmut, another volunteer!

1241
01:41:59,470 --> 01:42:01,995
I never expected
to see you again.

1242
01:42:02,072 --> 01:42:05,007
I'm like a bad penny;
I always turn up.

1243
01:42:05,075 --> 01:42:07,202
Step back now,
Dr.Schneider.

1244
01:42:07,278 --> 01:42:09,109
Give Dr.Jones some room.

1245
01:42:09,179 --> 01:42:12,171
He's going to recover
the Grail for us.

1246
01:42:14,218 --> 01:42:16,778
Impossible?
What do you say, Jones?

1247
01:42:16,854 --> 01:42:18,981
Ready to go down in history?

1248
01:42:19,056 --> 01:42:20,250
As what?

1249
01:42:20,324 --> 01:42:21,985
A Nazi stooge like you?

1250
01:42:22,059 --> 01:42:23,822
The Nazis?!

1251
01:42:23,894 --> 01:42:26,829
Is that the limit
of your vision?

1252
01:42:26,897 --> 01:42:28,728
The Nazis want
to write themselves

1253
01:42:28,799 --> 01:42:30,164
into the Grail legend...

1254
01:42:30,234 --> 01:42:31,861
take on the world.

1255
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:35,235
Well, they're welcome.

1256
01:42:35,306 --> 01:42:37,831
But I want
the Grail itself.

1257
01:42:37,908 --> 01:42:41,605
The cup that gives
everlasting life.

1258
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:43,010
Hitler can have
the world,

1259
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:44,638
but he can't
take it with him.

1260
01:42:44,715 --> 01:42:47,377
I'm going to be
drinking my own health

1261
01:42:47,451 --> 01:42:49,976
when he's gone the way
of the dodo.

1262
01:42:53,457 --> 01:42:54,890
The Grail is mine...

1263
01:42:54,959 --> 01:42:57,393
and you're going
to get it for me.

1264
01:42:57,461 --> 01:42:59,952
Shooting me
won't get you anywhere.

1265
01:43:00,030 --> 01:43:02,123
You know something,
Dr.Jones?

1266
01:43:02,199 --> 01:43:03,996
You're absolutely right.

1267
01:43:06,971 --> 01:43:08,939
Dad?

1268
01:43:09,006 --> 01:43:10,234
Dad?!

1269
01:43:10,374 --> 01:43:12,103
Junior...

1270
01:43:12,176 --> 01:43:13,973
- No!
- Get back!

1271
01:43:31,895 --> 01:43:33,988
You can't save him
when you're dead!

1272
01:43:34,064 --> 01:43:35,429
The healing power
of the Grail

1273
01:43:35,499 --> 01:43:37,763
is the only thing
that can save your father now.

1274
01:43:37,835 --> 01:43:41,293
It's time to ask yourself
what you believe.

1275
01:44:15,339 --> 01:44:19,833
"The Breath of God...

1276
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:23,539
...only the penitent man
will pass."

1277
01:44:23,614 --> 01:44:26,549
"The penitent man will pass.

1278
01:44:44,501 --> 01:44:47,265
The penitent man will pass.

1279
01:44:47,371 --> 01:44:50,033
The penitent man...

1280
01:44:52,476 --> 01:44:55,001
"Only the penitent man
will pass."

1281
01:44:55,079 --> 01:44:57,639
"Only the penitent
man will pass."

1282
01:44:57,715 --> 01:44:59,649
The penitent man will pass.

1283
01:44:59,717 --> 01:45:01,582
The penitent, penitent...

1284
01:45:01,652 --> 01:45:03,210
The penitent man...

1285
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:04,753
The penitent man...

1286
01:45:04,822 --> 01:45:05,880
The penitent...

1287
01:45:05,956 --> 01:45:08,982
The penitent man
is humble before God.

1288
01:45:09,059 --> 01:45:10,822
Penitent. Penitent...

1289
01:45:10,894 --> 01:45:12,725
The penitent man...

1290
01:45:12,796 --> 01:45:15,959
Penitent man
is humble...

1291
01:45:16,033 --> 01:45:17,557
...kneels before God.

1292
01:45:17,634 --> 01:45:18,601
Kneel!

1293
01:45:27,478 --> 01:45:28,843
I'm through!

1294
01:45:28,912 --> 01:45:32,473
We're through.

1295
01:45:34,451 --> 01:45:36,112
He's all right.

1296
01:45:36,186 --> 01:45:37,744
No.

1297
01:45:37,821 --> 01:45:40,813
The second challenge:
"The Word of God."

1298
01:45:40,891 --> 01:45:44,418
"Only in the footsteps
of God will he proceed."

1299
01:45:48,265 --> 01:45:50,859
The Word of God...

1300
01:45:50,934 --> 01:45:52,299
The Word of...

1301
01:45:55,506 --> 01:45:58,964
Proceed in the footsteps
of the Word.

1302
01:45:59,042 --> 01:46:00,304
"The Word of God..."

1303
01:46:00,377 --> 01:46:02,242
No, Henry.
Try not to talk.

1304
01:46:08,852 --> 01:46:11,821
The name of God...

1305
01:46:11,889 --> 01:46:16,883
The name of God...

1306
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,724
Jehovah.

1307
01:46:19,797 --> 01:46:25,360
But in the Latin alphabet,
Jehovah begins with an "I."

1308
01:46:25,435 --> 01:46:27,460
J...

1309
01:46:33,277 --> 01:46:34,403
Oh, dear.

1310
01:46:38,949 --> 01:46:40,211
Idiot!

1311
01:46:40,284 --> 01:46:43,913
In Latin, Jehovah
starts with an "I."

1312
01:46:45,522 --> 01:46:47,717
"I"...

1313
01:46:47,791 --> 01:46:50,157
"E"...

1314
01:46:50,227 --> 01:46:51,751
"H"...

1315
01:46:51,829 --> 01:46:53,023
"O"...

1316
01:46:53,096 --> 01:46:54,028
Oh!

1317
01:46:54,097 --> 01:46:56,497
"V"...

1318
01:46:56,567 --> 01:46:58,091
"A"...

1319
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:22,358
"The Path of God."

1320
01:47:24,995 --> 01:47:28,021
"Only in the leap
from the lion's head

1321
01:47:28,098 --> 01:47:32,034
will he prove his worth."

1322
01:47:34,271 --> 01:47:39,072
Impossible...
nobody can jump this.

1323
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:41,944
Indy!

1324
01:47:42,012 --> 01:47:44,037
Indy, you must hurry!

1325
01:47:44,114 --> 01:47:45,604
Come quickly!

1326
01:47:51,855 --> 01:47:54,255
It's a leap of faith.

1327
01:47:54,324 --> 01:47:55,814
Oh, geez...

1328
01:47:55,893 --> 01:47:58,453
You must believe, boy.

1329
01:47:58,528 --> 01:48:00,826
You must... believe.

1330
01:49:38,795 --> 01:49:40,922
Oh.

1331
01:49:47,270 --> 01:49:49,534
I knew you'd come,

1332
01:49:49,606 --> 01:49:52,200
but my strength has left me.

1333
01:49:52,275 --> 01:49:54,300
Who are you?

1334
01:49:54,378 --> 01:49:56,778
The last of three brothers

1335
01:49:56,847 --> 01:49:59,611
who swore an oath
to find the Grail

1336
01:49:59,683 --> 01:50:01,844
and to guard it.

1337
01:50:01,918 --> 01:50:04,648
That was 700 years ago.

1338
01:50:04,721 --> 01:50:07,588
A long time to wait.

1339
01:50:08,658 --> 01:50:10,853
You're strangely dressed...

1340
01:50:10,927 --> 01:50:12,918
for a knight.

1341
01:50:12,996 --> 01:50:15,590
I'm not exactly...

1342
01:50:15,665 --> 01:50:16,757
a knight.

1343
01:50:16,833 --> 01:50:18,130
What do you mean?

1344
01:50:18,201 --> 01:50:20,396
I was chosen

1345
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:23,564
because I was the bravest,
the most worthy.

1346
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:25,574
The honor was mine

1347
01:50:25,642 --> 01:50:28,202
until another came
to challenge me

1348
01:50:28,278 --> 01:50:31,441
to single combat.

1349
01:50:31,515 --> 01:50:33,483
I pass it...

1350
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:38,647
to you who vanquished me.

1351
01:50:40,424 --> 01:50:42,483
Listen, I don't have
time to explain, but...

1352
01:50:59,943 --> 01:51:02,138
Which one is it?

1353
01:51:02,212 --> 01:51:04,203
You must choose,

1354
01:51:04,281 --> 01:51:06,681
but choose wisely.

1355
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:09,548
For as the true Grail
will bring you life,

1356
01:51:09,619 --> 01:51:11,610
the false Grail

1357
01:51:11,688 --> 01:51:13,656
will take it from you.

1358
01:51:18,128 --> 01:51:21,029
I'm not a historian.

1359
01:51:21,098 --> 01:51:22,531
I have no idea

1360
01:51:22,599 --> 01:51:24,362
what it looks like.

1361
01:51:24,434 --> 01:51:25,924
Which one is it?

1362
01:51:26,002 --> 01:51:27,993
Let me choose.

1363
01:51:28,071 --> 01:51:30,505
Thank you, Doctor.

1364
01:51:43,553 --> 01:51:45,714
Oh, yes.

1365
01:51:50,327 --> 01:51:54,821
It's more beautiful
than I'd ever imagined.

1366
01:52:05,275 --> 01:52:09,109
This certainly is the cup
of the King of Kings.

1367
01:52:15,485 --> 01:52:17,715
Eternal life.

1368
01:52:52,022 --> 01:52:54,786
What is happening to me?

1369
01:52:56,860 --> 01:52:58,191
Oh!

1370
01:52:59,429 --> 01:53:01,795
Tell me, what is happening?

1371
01:53:24,888 --> 01:53:26,822
He chose...

1372
01:53:26,890 --> 01:53:29,222
poorly.

1373
01:53:38,668 --> 01:53:41,330
It would not be made
out of gold.

1374
01:53:41,404 --> 01:53:43,565
That's the cup
of a carpenter.

1375
01:53:53,416 --> 01:53:55,577
There's only one way
to find out.

1376
01:54:09,899 --> 01:54:14,563
You have chosen wisely.

1377
01:54:14,638 --> 01:54:19,507
But the Grail cannot pass
beyond the Great Seal.

1378
01:54:19,576 --> 01:54:24,411
That is the boundary
and the price of immortality.

1379
01:55:51,134 --> 01:55:54,001
Drop your guns. Please.

1380
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:59,003
Dad, come on,
get to your feet.

1381
01:56:12,922 --> 01:56:15,516
We have got it. Come on!

1382
01:56:17,026 --> 01:56:19,494
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

1383
01:56:19,562 --> 01:56:21,587
It's ours, Indy--
yours and mine.

1384
01:56:21,664 --> 01:56:23,723
Elsa, don't cross the Seal.

1385
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:24,994
The knight warned us

1386
01:56:25,068 --> 01:56:27,298
not to take
the Grail from here.

1387
01:56:53,863 --> 01:56:54,887
Junior!

1388
01:56:54,964 --> 01:56:56,363
Junior!

1389
01:56:59,202 --> 01:56:59,861
Elsa...

1390
01:57:01,571 --> 01:57:03,562
Elsa, don't. Elsa...

1391
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:05,073
Elsa...

1392
01:57:05,141 --> 01:57:06,608
Give me your other hand, honey.

1393
01:57:06,676 --> 01:57:07,700
I can't hold you!

1394
01:57:07,777 --> 01:57:09,142
I can reach it.

1395
01:57:09,212 --> 01:57:10,907
I can reach it.

1396
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:12,709
Elsa, give me your hand.
Give me your other hand!

1397
01:57:15,251 --> 01:57:16,240
Elsa!

1398
01:57:26,329 --> 01:57:28,661
Junior, give me
your other hand!

1399
01:57:28,731 --> 01:57:30,596
I can't hold on.

1400
01:57:30,667 --> 01:57:31,929
I can get it.

1401
01:57:32,001 --> 01:57:34,196
I can almost reach it, Dad.

1402
01:57:34,337 --> 01:57:35,929
Indiana...

1403
01:57:37,707 --> 01:57:38,935
Indiana...

1404
01:57:42,312 --> 01:57:44,542
Let it go.

1405
01:58:03,266 --> 01:58:05,700
Dad...

1406
01:58:12,208 --> 01:58:13,800
Please, Dad.

1407
01:58:44,941 --> 01:58:47,808
Elsa never really
believed in the Grail.

1408
01:58:47,877 --> 01:58:50,573
She thought she'd
found a prize.

1409
01:58:57,053 --> 01:58:59,453
What did you find, Dad?

1410
01:58:59,522 --> 01:59:01,012
Me?

1411
01:59:03,726 --> 01:59:05,250
Illumination.

1412
01:59:14,771 --> 01:59:16,295
And what did you find, Junior?

1413
01:59:16,372 --> 01:59:19,307
"Junior"? Dad...

1414
01:59:19,375 --> 01:59:21,172
Please, what does
it always mean,

1415
01:59:21,311 --> 01:59:22,573
this... this "Junior"?

1416
01:59:22,645 --> 01:59:24,772
That's his name:
Henry Jones, Junior.

1417
01:59:24,847 --> 01:59:26,508
I like Indiana.

1418
01:59:26,583 --> 01:59:27,948
We named the dog Indiana.

1419
01:59:28,017 --> 01:59:29,416
May we go home now,

1420
01:59:29,485 --> 01:59:30,747
please?

1421
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:31,980
The dog?

1422
01:59:33,823 --> 01:59:35,882
You are named after the dog?

1423
01:59:37,026 --> 01:59:41,292
I've got a lot of fond memories
of that dog.

1424
01:59:41,364 --> 01:59:44,128
Ready?

1425
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:45,827
Ready.

1426
01:59:45,902 --> 01:59:47,870
Indy! Henry! Follow me.

1427
01:59:47,937 --> 01:59:49,700
I know the way! Ha!

1428
01:59:53,009 --> 01:59:56,342
Got lost
in his own museum, huh?

1429
01:59:56,412 --> 01:59:58,175
Uh-huh.

1430
01:59:58,247 --> 02:00:00,613
After you, Junior.

1431
02:00:00,683 --> 02:00:02,241
Yes, sir. Ha!
