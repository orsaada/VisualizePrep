00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,845
Good evening! Namaskaar,
Sasrakaar, Aadaam.

2
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:22,937
Welcome to "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"!

3
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,509
Are you ready?

4
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:29,161
Yes.

5
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,182
- Please give a big round of applause to...
- Good Luck Kid
-...a very first contestant of the night

6
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:38,552
Jamal Malik from our very
own... Aarmchi Mumbay!

7
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:42,059
Hello, let's play.

8
00:01:50,556 --> 00:01:52,145
Smile, you'll be fine.

9
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:56,208
Name.

10
00:01:56,242 --> 00:02:01,409
Motherfucker, name!

11
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,114
Jamal... Malik.

12
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:07,168
You have a name. Good. Stop, crying.

13
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,505
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, very much.

14
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,349
Uh, so, Jamal...

15
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:20,802
tell me something about yourself.

16
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:25,013
I work in a call-center...

17
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:27,428
- ...in Juhu.
- Good.

18
00:02:27,462 --> 00:02:29,777
A phone basher..

19
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,687
And what type of call-center should that be?

20
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,437
XL5 mobile phones.

21
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:36,267
So you are the one who calls me up

22
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:38,643
every single day of my life
with special offers, huh?

23
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,278
No, actually I am an assistant.

24
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:47,040
An assistant phone basher?

25
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:50,909
And what does an assistant
phone basher do exactly?

26
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:55,243
I get tea for people and...

27
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:58,847
Chaiwalla? A chaiwalla!

28
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,386
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

29
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,417
Jamal Malik... one who serves
hot tea from Mumbay,

30
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:08,292
let's play "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"!

31
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,649
So, has he confessed yet?

32
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:22,527
Except his name I could not get
anything out of the runt.

33
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:26,396
You have been here the whole bloody
night, Srinivas. What have you been doing?

34
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,282
He's a tough guy.

35
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:31,191
A little electricity will
loosen his tongue, give him.

36
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:32,348
Yes sir.

37
00:03:40,783 --> 00:03:43,659
Ok, so were you wired up?

38
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:46,504
Mobile phone or a pager?

39
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:50,373
Or coughing accomplice in the audience?

40
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:54,474
Or microchip under your skin, huh?

41
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,466
The chip is not here.

42
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:04,368
Not here? Ok, leave it.
Leave it.

43
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:08,306
It's hot, and my wife is giving me hell.

44
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:11,800
I've got a desk full of murderers, rapists,

45
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:16,853
extortionists, bomb bandits, and you.

46
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:23,585
So why don't you save us both a lot of time

47
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:26,931
and tell me how you cheated.

48
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:29,808
Mmm... Hmm.

49
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,059
I'm done sir.

50
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:50,046
Now listen.

51
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:54,393
Hello!

52
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:58,516
He's is unconscious,
fucker. What good is that?

53
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:01,085
How many times have I told
you, you should once...

54
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:03,314
I'm sorry sir.

55
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:04,191
Good, good, good Srinivas...

56
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:06,143
Now we'll have Amnesty International here next

57
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:09,021
peeing in their pants about human rights.

58
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:09,945
Sir I was thinking...

59
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,816
Get him down, tidy him up please.
For God's sake!

60
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,537
Sir, what if he did know the answers?

61
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,447
Professors, doctors, lawyers,
general knowledge-wallas

62
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,365
never get beyond 60000 rupees.

63
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,251
He's on 10 million.

64
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:32,038
What the hell can a slumdog possibly know?

65
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:35,908
The answers!

66
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:44,027
I knew the Answers...

67
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:53,572
Jamal, catch it, catch it, Jamal!

68
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:57,542
Jamal, take the catch!

69
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,707
Hey man, how did you manage to drop
a sitter like that, damn it?

70
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,210
Private property!

71
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:11,321
Get lost from here!

72
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:13,059
Catch him!

73
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:14,978
Let's run.

74
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:17,621
The dogs are coming! Run!

75
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:20,501
Hey fatso!

76
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:23,406
If the planes won't kill you, we will!

77
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:28,839
Hey brother!

78
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:36,130
Hey fatso.

79
00:06:39,393 --> 00:06:40,352
Yahoo!...

80
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:45,628
- Hey, why running here?
- Not running!

81
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:51,671
Run, run!

82
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:54,010
Hey, what..?

83
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,220
Sorry!

84
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,099
There comes...

85
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:01,251
- Go, go, go...
- I'm very sorry.

86
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:12,265
Oh shit, it's Mum.

87
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:13,652
Want to break your bones, huh?

88
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:17,913
Brother, please forgive them.

89
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,883
Come on.

90
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:23,803
We are going to school.

91
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,637
Athos.

92
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:32,576
The Three Musketeers.

93
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:36,224
Repeat it!
"You have sent for me, Sir?" said Athos.

94
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,469
Ah, here come our very own musketeers.

95
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,928
Thank you for gracing us all
with your presence.

96
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:46,898
Porthos!

97
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:48,495
Open it.

98
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:50,415
Salim, open it correctly.

99
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:54,437
Don't know how to open a book.
What do you think yourself, huh?

100
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:55,606
Athos?

101
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:16,685
So... Mr. Malik

102
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:19,872
the man who knows all the answers.

103
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:23,149
Talk.

104
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:26,204
Whoreson talk!

105
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:34,912
So Jamal, are you ready for the
first question, for 1000 rupees?

106
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:37,535
Yes.

107
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:38,528
Not bad money to sit on a chair

108
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:40,411
and answer a question.

109
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:43,323
Better than making tea, no?

110
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:45,208
No. Yes. No.

111
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:49,557
No? Yes? No? Is that your final answer?

112
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:53,872
So remember. You have three lifelines.

113
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:57,709
Ask the audience, fifty-fifty

114
00:09:57,743 --> 00:09:59,593
and call a friend.

115
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:03,329
So the first question, for 1000 rupees,
here we go.

116
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:10,040
Who was the star in the 1973
hit-film "Zanjeer"?

117
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:21,391
I'm in trouble, here...

118
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:27,440
Here... Money. Take the money...

119
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:34,154
Get out of there, Jamal.
Prakash wants a big one.

120
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:37,991
Not finished.

121
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:40,035
Stop your time-pass boys. This is urgent...

122
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:42,140
It's a shy one...

123
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,820
and since when there is
a time limit on a crap?

124
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:47,548
This is borderline kid. Get a move on...

125
00:10:47,582 --> 00:10:51,419
Since there was a customer waiting,
that's when Jamal!

126
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:54,295
Give me the money back!
Give! I'll go elsewhere.

127
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:57,140
Bloody idiot.

128
00:10:57,174 --> 00:11:01,009
You just lost me a bloody customer.

129
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:03,854
Amitabh's helicopter!

130
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:05,072
That's Amitabh's helicopter!

131
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:06,481
Amitabh!

132
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:11,004
Amitabh Bachchan!

133
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:27,173
Salim, open it!

134
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:08,774
Amitabh Bachchan!

135
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:26,251
My Amitabh sir!

136
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:28,515
Move, move! Out of the way!

137
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,958
Please wait, I am coming for you!

138
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,813
Amitabh sir, please give me your autograph

139
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,858
Yea, got Amithab's autograph!

140
00:12:57,061 --> 00:13:02,758
You've got it now have you?
Amitabh's autograph?

141
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:39,895
That was my autograph!
My autograph!

142
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:41,860
Amitabh gave it to me!

143
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:43,596
I'll never get another!

144
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:46,966
He offered a good price, so I sold it.

145
00:13:47,032 --> 00:13:49,169
But it was mine...

146
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:53,614
A, Amitabh Bachchan.

147
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:56,512
Guess what, you're right.
You just won 1,000 rupees.

148
00:14:00,395 --> 00:14:01,782
You don't have to be a genius.

149
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:04,269
I knew it was Amitabh Bachchan.

150
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,229
- Hmm..?
- Umm.

151
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:08,517
Like I said, you do not have to be a genius.

152
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:13,698
He's the most famous man in India.

153
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:19,607
A picture of three lions, as seen
on the national emblem of India.

154
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:22,841
What is written underneath?

155
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:26,298
A: The truth alone triumphs

156
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:29,386
B: Lies alone triumph

157
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:32,128
C: Fashion alone triumphs

158
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:36,358
D: Money alone triumphs

159
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,008
What do you think, Jamal?

160
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,271
The most famous phrase of our country.

161
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:49,708
Do you like to call a friend?

162
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:52,119
Ask the audience.

163
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:54,997
Put the poor man out of his
misery, ladies and gentlemen?

164
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,906
My five-year old daughter
can answer that question,

165
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,237
but you couldn't.

166
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:01,956
That's strange for a millionaire genius.

167
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:04,127
What happened?

168
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,498
Your accomplice sneaked out for a piss?

169
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,341
The inspector is asking something.

170
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,379
How much is panipuri at
Dharisha store on Chowpatty?

171
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:15,497
What?

172
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,844
Panipuri. One plate. How much?

173
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,958
- 10 rupees.
- Wrong.

174
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:21,905
15 since Diwali.

175
00:15:23,802 --> 00:15:26,329
Who stole Constable Varmy's bicycle

176
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,932
outside Santa Cruz station last Thursday?

177
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:31,865
You know who that was?

178
00:15:32,435 --> 00:15:34,353
Everyone in Juhu knows that.

179
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:37,090
Even five year olds.

180
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,898
Congratulations, Jamal.
You just won 4,000 rupees.

181
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:50,930
A 16 thousand rupees.

182
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:56,390
Religion. Interesting.

183
00:15:57,371 --> 00:15:59,976
In depictions of God Rama he is

184
00:15:59,977 --> 00:16:03,479
famously holding what in his right hand?

185
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:13,552
Hey, Jamal.

186
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:50,133
Run, Jamal!

187
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,093
Run!

188
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:56,410
Salim, Jamal! Run!

189
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,590
They're Muslims, get them!

190
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,278
Come on Salim, come on.

191
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:12,841
Jamal let's go!

192
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:43,053
Run!

193
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:57,941
Let's Run!

194
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:09,583
Hey, get lost!

195
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:12,914
Why are you standing? Go home!

196
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:19,190
- Go Jamal.
- Come with us.

197
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:35,181
I wake up every morning wishing I did
not know the answer to that question.

198
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,336
If it wasn't for Rama and Allah...

199
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:45,717
I would still have a mother.

200
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:56,386
A bow and arrow.

201
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:57,995
Final answer?

202
00:19:00,427 --> 00:19:01,570
Final answer.

203
00:19:04,396 --> 00:19:06,476
Computer-ji, lock D.

204
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:14,225
You just won 16000 rupees.

205
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:18,166
Well done, my friend.

206
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:22,736
Time for commercial break.
Don't go away, now.

207
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,422
You got lucky, huh?

208
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,623
If I were you I'd take the money and run.

209
00:19:29,365 --> 00:19:31,313
You're not going to the next one.

210
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:05,298
Piss off!

211
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:07,398
She'll have the security guard on us!

212
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:08,750
Let her in?

213
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:12,936
She could be our third musketeer.

214
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,142
I'm elder in the family,
and I say, she's not coming in, okay?

215
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,163
After all...

216
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:24,038
Which rascal knows the name
of the third musketeer.

217
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:37,563
Run Jamal..

218
00:20:38,522 --> 00:20:39,480
Run!

219
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,658
Salim?

220
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:54,921
Hey.

221
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,237
Hey!

222
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:02,084
Come here.

223
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,112
Come here.

224
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:17,625
You have mother?

225
00:21:18,704 --> 00:21:20,520
Father?

226
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:25,528
I'm Jamal.

227
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,761
And that's my elder brother Salim.

228
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:31,035
I'm Latika.

229
00:21:31,138 --> 00:21:33,927
You can sleep here if you want.

230
00:21:40,762 --> 00:21:42,635
Thank you Jamal.

231
00:21:57,945 --> 00:22:00,048
Welcome back to "Who
Wants To Be A Milionaire?"

232
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:03,748
Our contestant, Jamal Malik,
call-center assistant from Mumbay,

233
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,259
is on 16 thousand rupees,

234
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,851
and has already used only one
lifeline, ask the audience.

235
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,950
So my friend, you're into serious money.

236
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,977
Shall we play?

237
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:18,627
Yes.

238
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:28,684
The song "Darshan Do Ghanshyam" was
written by which famous Indian poet?

239
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:31,099
A: Surdas

240
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:33,264
B: Tulsidas

241
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:35,021
C: Mira Bai

242
00:22:35,434 --> 00:22:37,616
D: Kabir

243
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:01,018
Jamal.

244
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:32,956
Hello.

245
00:23:37,738 --> 00:23:38,647
It's hot, huh?

246
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:26,028
Here son.

247
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:30,730
The way he's taking care of
us, he must be a good man.

248
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:32,406
Must be a bloody saint.

249
00:24:32,407 --> 00:24:34,590
We're not allowed to talk to the others.

250
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:36,244
Why?

251
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:40,480
If he is giving us food for the third time, then
he really must be a saint.

252
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:49,306
Arvind.

253
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:02,046
Very good, Arvind. It's good.

254
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,923
Salim.

255
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:17,133
Laughing at me. I'll kill you.

256
00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:19,452
Hey, get off her.

257
00:25:19,837 --> 00:25:21,763
Don't touch me!

258
00:25:21,764 --> 00:25:23,267
You fat bastard!

259
00:25:23,364 --> 00:25:24,228
Don't touch me.

260
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,045
Don't touch!

261
00:25:27,076 --> 00:25:29,408
Punnoose, I think you've found your dog.

262
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:45,832
Okay, get to work.
Let's get to work.

263
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,473
Think you're here for a picnic?

264
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,559
Rascals, never do the job...
always play all day long?

265
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:04,280
What are you laughing at?

266
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:09,434
Give me that.

267
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:10,394
No.

268
00:26:10,587 --> 00:26:11,450
Just give...

269
00:26:13,392 --> 00:26:14,267
Shut up!

270
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,572
Brother Salim.

271
00:26:16,748 --> 00:26:18,556
What's up little brother, you got a problem?

272
00:26:18,557 --> 00:26:20,474
Hey take her. She's for you.

273
00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:21,806
I don't want her.

274
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:24,820
Take her. It's for your own
good. Babies earn double.

275
00:26:24,821 --> 00:26:27,054
She said she doesn't want her.

276
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:27,991
You shut up Jamal!

277
00:26:29,272 --> 00:26:31,661
Take her or i'll drop.

278
00:26:32,141 --> 00:26:33,005
No! No!

279
00:26:36,068 --> 00:26:39,306
Crying baby, triple price.

280
00:26:40,985 --> 00:26:43,456
Come on! Come on! Get to work!

281
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,623
Let's get to work.

282
00:26:57,461 --> 00:26:58,325
Get lost, have to go there.

283
00:27:07,816 --> 00:27:11,410
We'll use the hottest ones.

284
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:23,495
Come.

285
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:07,877
Chillies on his willy!

286
00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:15,428
I'll get you back!

287
00:28:17,101 --> 00:28:18,899
Go back to sleep all of you!

288
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:21,680
Silence.

289
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:22,640
Shut up! Go back to sleep.

290
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:46,012
Very good. I am happy.

291
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:49,965
- He is ready.
- Yes, I'm ready as well.

292
00:29:04,825 --> 00:29:06,563
Come on, move the lamp.

293
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:50,651
Okay.

294
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:54,200
Salim...

295
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:58,227
Bring Jamal over.

296
00:30:02,064 --> 00:30:02,927
Jamal.

297
00:30:12,888 --> 00:30:18,179
Listen, kid. Time has arrived to take decision.

298
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:22,663
You want the life of a slumdog
or the life of a man, huh?

299
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:26,315
A real man. A gunfighter.

300
00:30:26,316 --> 00:30:29,349
Your destiny is in your hands, brother.

301
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:33,928
You can take my place or...

302
00:30:35,939 --> 00:30:37,239
Understand?

303
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,246
Understood.

304
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,392
Go. Get Jamal.

305
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,094
Punnoose.

306
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:59,164
I just need Maman to like my
singing, and we're in the money.

307
00:30:59,165 --> 00:31:01,800
Big money, Latika.

308
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:04,197
And then can we stop begging?

309
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:06,513
Begging? Are you crazy?

310
00:31:06,514 --> 00:31:08,838
We'll live in a big house on Harbour Road.

311
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:11,763
You, me and Salim. The Three Musketeers.

312
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:13,531
Harbour Road. Really?

313
00:31:13,532 --> 00:31:14,772
Yes.

314
00:31:17,148 --> 00:31:19,066
In the moonlight night...

315
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,990
You and me.

316
00:31:20,024 --> 00:31:22,875
You'll dance like this, huh?

317
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:28,352
I hope you don't sing just like the way you dance.

318
00:31:30,752 --> 00:31:31,711
Jamal, let's go.

319
00:31:32,477 --> 00:31:33,437
It's my turn.

320
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,855
Sing well.

321
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:46,166
So this is it, our day, huh, brother?

322
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:51,089
Today our time has changed, brother.

323
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,497
Athos.

324
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:57,104
Porthos?

325
00:31:59,224 --> 00:32:00,991
Hmm, when I say, then.

326
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:14,419
Jamal.

327
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:18,530
It's time to get professional.

328
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:20,414
What? Really?

329
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:23,191
First, let me hear that devotional song...

330
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:24,151
Okay.

331
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:27,054
Darshan to Ghanshyam.

332
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:29,390
That's my favourite devotional song.

333
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:37,074
Fifty rupees.

334
00:32:40,351 --> 00:32:42,248
I'm a professional now, what can I do?

335
00:32:42,816 --> 00:32:43,959
Rascal.

336
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,237
Here you go.

337
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:10,858
Jamal, go. Run!

338
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:12,899
Hold on! Catch them!

339
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,243
Run!

340
00:33:16,076 --> 00:33:18,792
Get the torches! Get them!

341
00:33:25,698 --> 00:33:27,137
Run Jamal, run!

342
00:33:31,646 --> 00:33:33,468
Salim they are going to kill you!

343
00:33:33,852 --> 00:33:34,812
Stop, rascal!

344
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:43,958
Latika, run! Run!

345
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:44,917
Salim!

346
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,469
Jamal.

347
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,800
Brother, run.

348
00:34:06,788 --> 00:34:07,747
Jamal.

349
00:34:07,938 --> 00:34:08,897
Get that rascal.

350
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:17,277
Come on, Latika! Grab the hand!

351
00:34:18,907 --> 00:34:19,867
Grab the hand! Latika!

352
00:34:26,676 --> 00:34:27,636
Latika.

353
00:34:30,515 --> 00:34:32,240
Latika!

354
00:34:33,045 --> 00:34:35,023
- What happened?
- She let go!

355
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:38,393
- What happened to her?
- What can I do?

356
00:34:43,095 --> 00:34:45,012
Salim!

357
00:34:45,271 --> 00:34:48,182
We've got to go back.
We've got to go.

358
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:50,101
Go back and we're dead.

359
00:34:50,102 --> 00:34:51,984
Have you gone mad?

360
00:34:51,985 --> 00:34:55,620
He was going to take your eyes out!

361
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:57,328
With a spoon.

362
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:09,618
Don't worry about her. She'll be fine.

363
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:13,911
She always is.

364
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,867
Surdas.

365
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:40,349
Surdas?

366
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:47,532
Surdas, is your final answer?

367
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,714
Yes.

368
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:58,429
Guess what, you're right!

369
00:36:05,836 --> 00:36:07,985
Blind singers earn double you know that?

370
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:11,932
What happened to a girl?
They blinded her too?

371
00:36:14,502 --> 00:36:17,164
They had other plans.

372
00:36:17,345 --> 00:36:21,513
Well it took me a long time to find out.

373
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:42,249
Let it go, man.

374
00:36:44,233 --> 00:36:46,152
Come on.

375
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:46,920
Where?

376
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,756
Rats are running inside my stomach.

377
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:47,496
Buy peanuts, kurkura.

378
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:55,168
Three for two.

379
00:38:03,071 --> 00:38:04,318
Get up!

380
00:38:04,511 --> 00:38:06,142
Is this your father's train?

381
00:38:06,237 --> 00:38:09,113
So is it your father's train then?

382
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,671
Hey, the boy stealing the paratas!

383
00:38:53,235 --> 00:38:54,672
Get off me.

384
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,861
Is this heaven?

385
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:36,123
You are not dead, Jamal.

386
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:38,805
What is it?

387
00:39:38,806 --> 00:39:40,900
Some hotel huh?

388
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:47,327
The Taj Mahal is considered the
finest example of Mugal architecture.

389
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:55,764
Taj Mahal was completed around 1648 using
the labour force of 20'000 workers.

390
00:39:56,085 --> 00:40:01,432
In 1980 it became a UNESCO
World Heritage Site and was cited as the...

391
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,268
Official tour guide.

392
00:40:15,302 --> 00:40:17,381
Please take off your shoes

393
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:37,045
Please, please.

394
00:40:37,046 --> 00:40:38,507
What time is the next tour?

395
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:40,929
We are on tight schedule.

396
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,475
We have to see the Red
Fort this afternoon.

397
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:43,974
VISITORS ARE REQUESTED TO COLLECT RECEIPT

398
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:47,714
- No, I...
- Please, would it be possible
to show us up round now?

399
00:40:47,715 --> 00:40:53,452
Obviously we understand that it
costs more for just the two of us.

400
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,924
But of course madam!

401
00:40:56,528 --> 00:40:57,856
Please follow me.

402
00:40:58,362 --> 00:41:02,164
The Taj Mahal was built by Emperor Khurrama

403
00:41:02,197 --> 00:41:07,472
for his wife Mumtaz, who was the
maximum beautiful woman in the world.

404
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:12,749
Then when she died, the emperor
decided to build this five-star hotel,

405
00:41:12,782 --> 00:41:15,591
for everyone who would
like to visit her tomb.

406
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:21,379
But he died in 1587 before any of the
rooms were built, or any of the lifts.

407
00:41:22,339 --> 00:41:28,093
But this swimming pool as you can see was
completed on schedule in top class fashion.

408
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,897
Is says nothing of this in the guide book.

409
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:37,685
The guide book was written by a bunch
of lazy good-for-nothing Indian beggars.

410
00:41:39,635 --> 00:41:44,398
And this lady and gentlemen
is the burial place of Mumtaz.

411
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:47,241
How did she die?

412
00:41:47,275 --> 00:41:49,673
- A road traffic accident.
- Really?

413
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,038
Maximum pile-up.

414
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:55,874
I thought she died in childbirth.

415
00:41:55,907 --> 00:42:00,702
Exactly sir. She was on the way
to hospital when it happened.

416
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,188
Ready?

417
00:42:10,231 --> 00:42:11,582
Smile.

418
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:21,388
Shoes! American brands!

419
00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:37,215
It's high temperature, huh?

420
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:45,389
Smile.

421
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:53,543
Hey thieves, stop!

422
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:02,085
This, Mr David, is the biggest
Dhobi Ghat in the whole of India.

423
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:03,970
That's amazing.

424
00:43:04,004 --> 00:43:06,880
Come on, take a real good look at this.

425
00:43:06,914 --> 00:43:09,725
They say that every man in Uttar Pradesh

426
00:43:10,142 --> 00:43:15,513
is wearing a kurta that has been
at least washed once out here.

427
00:43:15,513 --> 00:43:16,473
Fast, fast!

428
00:43:21,623 --> 00:43:26,294
Move it around! Pit-stop's god
speed! Schumacher's style!

429
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:31,346
There are the cows or are those
buffalos... What are those over there?

430
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:32,304
Go, go. Let's run!

431
00:43:39,523 --> 00:43:41,374
Oh, shit.

432
00:43:41,408 --> 00:43:42,334
What the hell happened here?

433
00:43:42,335 --> 00:43:43,294
Motherfucker!

434
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:49,721
Ok, that's enough!

435
00:43:51,034 --> 00:43:52,883
Ok. Hold it!
Hold it, will you.

436
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:54,836
You've got the insurance don't you?

437
00:43:55,214 --> 00:43:55,944
Are you ok?

438
00:43:56,388 --> 00:43:58,859
You wanted to see a bit
of real India? Here it is!

439
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:01,067
Alright!

440
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,444
Well, here is a bit of
the real America, son.

441
00:44:03,994 --> 00:44:05,385
("Money")

442
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:06,953
Oh, yes, yes! Jesus...

443
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:11,076
Here.

444
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,764
On an american 100 dollar bill

445
00:45:53,765 --> 00:45:57,719
there's a portrait of
which american statesman?

446
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:01,486
A: George Washington

447
00:46:01,487 --> 00:46:04,850
B: Franklin Roosevelt

448
00:46:04,851 --> 00:46:08,230
C: Benjamin Franklin

449
00:46:08,231 --> 00:46:11,487
D: Abraham Lincoln

450
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:19,146
Pay or play, Jamal?

451
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,379
You decide.

452
00:46:22,538 --> 00:46:26,373
Oh god he's looking at the
camera. He hasn't got a clue.

453
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:29,268
This is gonna be a walk away. Stand by.

454
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:32,127
No, he's gonna play with him first.

455
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:34,013
Jamal?

456
00:46:34,046 --> 00:46:38,985
Get a lot of 100 dollar bills
in your in your line of work?

457
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:42,645
A minimum tip for my services.

458
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:45,555
Oh, now I know why my
cellphone bills are so high.

459
00:46:45,588 --> 00:46:49,392
They tip the chaiwalla
with 100 dollar bills.

460
00:46:49,426 --> 00:46:51,805
It's C. Benjamin Franklin.

461
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,154
You're gonna play, huh?

462
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:56,104
I think I've just had, hadn't I?

463
00:46:56,138 --> 00:46:58,039
So you exactly have C, right?

464
00:46:58,073 --> 00:46:59,942
Who's on 1,000 rupee note?

465
00:46:59,975 --> 00:47:02,335
I don't know.

466
00:47:02,868 --> 00:47:04,357
You don't know?

467
00:47:05,998 --> 00:47:07,351
Ghandi-ji

468
00:47:08,279 --> 00:47:10,319
Oh, I have heard of him.

469
00:47:13,403 --> 00:47:14,295
Don't get clever

470
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:17,205
or I'll get the electricity out again.

471
00:47:17,238 --> 00:47:19,090
Look.

472
00:47:19,124 --> 00:47:22,959
They didn't ask me that
question. I don't know why.

473
00:47:22,993 --> 00:47:24,844
Ask them.

474
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:30,632
It's funny, you don't seem
like you're interested in money.

475
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:33,613
By the fact you have...

476
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:37,843
one million rupees!

477
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:44,254
Explain the 100 dollar bill.

478
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:49,187
Bombay had turned name to Mumbay.

479
00:47:51,766 --> 00:47:53,512
Why don't you understand?

480
00:48:23,383 --> 00:48:27,187
A girl lived here. As tall as me perhaps.

481
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:31,074
- Her name was Latika.
- We don't know anyone of that name.

482
00:48:45,654 --> 00:48:47,381
Ok, she stayed somewhere over there,
you know right?

483
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:50,257
Don't know.

484
00:48:58,356 --> 00:49:02,312
Two chicken burgers, two
fries, one mango rassi, one coke!

485
00:49:02,313 --> 00:49:04,002
One mineral water!

486
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:08,439
Shimla.

487
00:49:09,419 --> 00:49:13,737
I'm going to Chowpatty, ok? Wanna come?

488
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:18,052
For god's sake, you've got some disease?

489
00:49:18,085 --> 00:49:20,467
You're forcing back to this shithole.

490
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,847
We leave our friends, a good life,

491
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,782
lots of money. For this?

492
00:49:24,816 --> 00:49:26,651
We came back to find her.

493
00:49:26,684 --> 00:49:30,040
You did. I don't give a shit about her.

494
00:49:30,074 --> 00:49:33,398
Plenty of pussy in Bombay for Salim.

495
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:34,324
Oh yes sir!

496
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:37,234
You should come back to
the Cages on Saturday night,

497
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:41,069
instead of ghost searching
for your lost love.

498
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,484
I'm going to Chowpatty.

499
00:49:43,518 --> 00:49:45,833
I'm going to Chowpatty!

500
00:49:45,866 --> 00:49:49,702
There are 19 million
people in this city, Jamal.

501
00:49:49,735 --> 00:49:52,580
Forget about her.

502
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,925
She is a WOMAN.

503
00:50:14,198 --> 00:50:15,636
Greetings, Sir.

504
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:19,423
Blessings be unto those
who do good for others.

505
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:30,480
Dollars. How much?

506
00:50:30,481 --> 00:50:33,375
- 100.
- Why are you fooling me sir?

507
00:50:33,376 --> 00:50:36,640
Honestly. I swear on my mothers soul.

508
00:50:36,641 --> 00:50:42,874
What's on this note? Tell me. Whose picture is it?

509
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:45,297
There's an old man...

510
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:49,166
He's bald on top with long
hair on the sides, like a girl.

511
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,304
Benjamin Franklin.

512
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,707
So you're a big guy now, Jamal.

513
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:03,089
Good. I'm happy for you.

514
00:51:03,123 --> 00:51:05,438
I'm sorry...

515
00:51:05,472 --> 00:51:08,348
You got saved my friend. I wasn't so lucky.

516
00:51:08,381 --> 00:51:10,763
That's the only difference.

517
00:51:10,796 --> 00:51:12,930
Arvind, I'm trying to find...

518
00:51:12,963 --> 00:51:15,061
You owe Maman. Stay away.

519
00:51:15,095 --> 00:51:17,422
He never forgets.

520
00:51:17,423 --> 00:51:19,842
I owe Latika.

521
00:51:21,775 --> 00:51:22,701
She's alive isn't she?

522
00:51:22,735 --> 00:51:28,306
More than alive. She's on Pila
street. They call her Cherry.

523
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:32,211
Thanks.

524
00:51:37,217 --> 00:51:39,230
I'll be singing at your funeral.

525
00:51:50,836 --> 00:51:51,699
Know Cherry?

526
00:52:03,209 --> 00:52:06,565
- Where can we found Cherry?
- You want Cherry? Get lost! Go home.

527
00:52:22,294 --> 00:52:23,733
Where's Cherry?

528
00:52:45,506 --> 00:52:46,463
Get lost! Take another one.

529
00:52:49,342 --> 00:52:50,494
- Cherry?
- Inside.

530
00:52:57,686 --> 00:53:01,316
So, is it her or not?

531
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,723
She's sexy, man!

532
00:53:09,723 --> 00:53:10,683
Get on, Latika!

533
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:16,834
- Who is this?
- Jamal?

534
00:53:16,868 --> 00:53:19,744
- I'll get the bags.
- Who are you? What do you want?

535
00:53:19,778 --> 00:53:22,622
- You stupid boys!
- Pack it in! Put that.

536
00:53:22,656 --> 00:53:24,575
How did you find me?

537
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,533
Later, later...

538
00:53:29,336 --> 00:53:30,550
Take the cash. Come on!

539
00:53:30,551 --> 00:53:32,229
We got it. Let's go! Let's go!

540
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:34,888
Shit.

541
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,956
Look who we have here!

542
00:53:40,498 --> 00:53:42,039
Hello again.

543
00:53:42,463 --> 00:53:46,869
Jamal, Salim.

544
00:53:47,856 --> 00:53:49,523
I never forget a face.

545
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:51,362
Right Punnoose?

546
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:54,578
especially one that I own.

547
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:02,905
You really thought you could just
walk in and take my prize away?

548
00:54:02,938 --> 00:54:05,522
Latika, come.

549
00:54:09,618 --> 00:54:15,153
Have you any idea how much
this little virgin is worth? Sisterfucker!

550
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:18,353
- Please continue, Master-ji.
- Ok, sir.

551
00:54:18,354 --> 00:54:20,617
- Get them out of here!
- No!

552
00:54:27,188 --> 00:54:29,701
Move! Get over there!

553
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:35,034
Let's not be foolish, Salim.

554
00:54:35,068 --> 00:54:39,349
Heavy, isn't it? Give it to me. Huh?

555
00:54:39,383 --> 00:54:44,640
On your knees! Down!

556
00:54:44,674 --> 00:54:49,901
Both of you! Down!

557
00:54:49,934 --> 00:54:52,743
Money!

558
00:54:52,777 --> 00:54:58,106
You can have money, here.

559
00:54:59,524 --> 00:55:03,850
Look.

560
00:55:04,286 --> 00:55:10,042
Take it. Go, disappear with your friend.
And we'll forget all about this, ok?

561
00:55:11,033 --> 00:55:15,366
Maman never forgets. Isn't that right?

562
00:55:15,367 --> 00:55:19,482
Oh, Maman can make an exception, huh?

563
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:22,349
I can't take that risk Maman. Sorry.

564
00:55:34,052 --> 00:55:36,536
Let's go.

565
00:55:36,897 --> 00:55:41,533
- Stay!
- Jamal!

566
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:47,462
Let's go! Let's go!

567
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,354
Who invented the revolver?

568
00:56:03,783 --> 00:56:06,594
Samuel Colt.

569
00:56:06,628 --> 00:56:09,026
Final answer?

570
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,389
Final answer.

571
00:56:11,423 --> 00:56:16,220
Jamal Malik, you're on a dream run.

572
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:21,015
My heart says you're gonna win more.

573
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:27,762
Computer-ji, lock A.

574
00:56:31,598 --> 00:56:33,449
I was right.

575
00:56:33,483 --> 00:56:38,278
The chaiwalla has done it again.

576
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,327
Incredible!

577
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,246
Reception!

578
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:04,961
Let's go.

579
00:57:19,914 --> 00:57:21,353
Found something?

580
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,355
Stay there. Look away.

581
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:25,240
Ok, ok.

582
00:57:25,274 --> 00:57:28,152
I'll know if you're looking.

583
00:57:28,186 --> 00:57:30,035
No i'm not.

584
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:32,647
Is Salim still there?

585
00:57:39,694 --> 00:57:42,113
Where is Salim?

586
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:46,052
I don't know.

587
00:57:48,293 --> 00:57:50,983
You're a sweet boy, Jamal.

588
00:58:41,006 --> 00:58:43,391
I'm looking for Javed.

589
00:58:43,392 --> 00:58:46,281
Motherfucker! He's not looking for you.

590
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:52,519
I killed Maman,

591
00:58:52,552 --> 00:58:55,429
and I'll kill you too.

592
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,555
Easy.

593
00:59:00,556 --> 00:59:02,486
Did you really kill him?

594
00:59:07,899 --> 00:59:12,029
Good. My enemy's enemy is a friend.

595
00:59:14,646 --> 00:59:17,198
Come here, my friend.

596
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:25,067
Hmm..I've been looking for someone like you.

597
00:59:31,909 --> 00:59:35,711
You came back for me.

598
00:59:35,745 --> 00:59:39,611
Of course.

599
00:59:40,508 --> 00:59:43,350
I thought you'd forgotten.

600
00:59:43,384 --> 00:59:47,222
I never forgot. Not for one moment.

601
00:59:47,255 --> 00:59:51,057
I knew I'd find you in the end.

602
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:54,893
It's our destiny.

603
00:59:54,926 --> 00:59:57,730
Destiny?

604
00:59:58,272 --> 00:59:59,917
Ok.

605
01:00:15,262 --> 01:00:16,318
Hey.

606
01:00:21,781 --> 01:00:24,592
Come.

607
01:00:24,626 --> 01:00:26,545
No, brother. You had a lot to drink.

608
01:00:26,578 --> 01:00:30,380
I am the elder. I am the boss.

609
01:00:30,414 --> 01:00:33,258
For once, you do as I say.

610
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:36,101
Now get out!

611
01:00:36,135 --> 01:00:38,053
Come on, I saved your life, didn't I?

612
01:00:38,087 --> 01:00:39,265
Salim, please...

613
01:00:39,266 --> 01:00:40,225
Shut up.

614
01:00:41,183 --> 01:00:42,559
I'll kill you!

615
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:43,519
Salim!

616
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:51,193
I'll kill you!

617
01:00:56,276 --> 01:01:02,030
I am number one now.

618
01:01:02,031 --> 01:01:03,182
Salim!

619
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:06,356
Salim! Open!

620
01:01:06,673 --> 01:01:08,710
Shut up!

621
01:01:08,744 --> 01:01:11,588
The man with the Colt 45 says shut up!

622
01:01:11,622 --> 01:01:16,417
Go now or gun master-ji and I will
shoot you right between the eyes.

623
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:19,261
Don't think you won't.

624
01:01:19,295 --> 01:01:22,171
I'm giving you five seconds.

625
01:01:22,205 --> 01:01:25,545
One.

626
01:01:25,579 --> 01:01:28,851
Two.

627
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:32,071
Go, Jamal.

628
01:01:32,072 --> 01:01:33,031
Go.

629
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,025
Let's go.

630
01:01:58,618 --> 01:02:01,494
So, did you see them again?

631
01:02:01,528 --> 01:02:04,372
I wouldn't be here if I had.

632
01:02:04,406 --> 01:02:08,704
Was she pretty?

633
01:02:08,738 --> 01:02:12,021
I guess not.

634
01:02:12,621 --> 01:02:15,252
The most beautiful woman in the world.

635
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:16,895
You mean the bitch of the slum.

636
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,239
Sisterfucker.

637
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,211
Hey hero.

638
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:23,131
Hey beat him!

639
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:26,968
Hey lock him down!

640
01:02:27,065 --> 01:02:29,463
Lock him... he fights! Motherfucker!

641
01:02:29,836 --> 01:02:33,400
Well well... the slumdog barks.

642
01:02:34,137 --> 01:02:35,029
Money and women.

643
01:02:35,063 --> 01:02:37,461
The reasons for make most mistakes in life.

644
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,422
Correct.

645
01:02:38,934 --> 01:02:43,306
Looks like you've mixed up both.

646
01:02:43,339 --> 01:02:47,316
Srinivas, you need the exersice.

647
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:50,442
Go and get me something to eat.

648
01:02:50,443 --> 01:02:52,807
Yes sir.

649
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:54,382
And tea.

650
01:03:05,755 --> 01:03:08,302
Idiot, Srinivas.

651
01:03:13,426 --> 01:03:15,312
You puzzled me slumdog.

652
01:03:15,345 --> 01:03:19,181
Admitting murder to avoid child fraud.

653
01:03:19,214 --> 01:03:23,978
Is not exactly clever thinking.

654
01:03:24,011 --> 01:03:28,739
Now why would you do that?

655
01:03:28,773 --> 01:03:34,527
When somebody asks me a
question I tell them the answer.

656
01:03:39,356 --> 01:03:45,078
So, how did you manage to get on the show?

657
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:47,971
Okay everyone, listen up.

658
01:03:48,004 --> 01:03:50,833
It's been a big week for UK.

659
01:03:50,866 --> 01:03:53,675
Kat is back.

660
01:03:53,709 --> 01:03:58,137
But she is already back. Bardi... Jamal?

661
01:03:58,138 --> 01:04:02,341
Oh, well, she did come back, then she
went away when Alfie split up with her.

662
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:06,177
And now she's back again, but it
looks as if Alfie still fancies more...

663
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,062
Thank you, Jamal.

664
01:04:08,096 --> 01:04:11,673
Bardi, keep up. The
chaiwalla knows more than you.

665
01:04:11,707 --> 01:04:15,249
Anyway, there's also the
festival in Edinburgh.

666
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:16,872
Anybody knows Edinburgh, Edinburgh?

667
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:22,483
Kilts, castles, ...uh, haggis. Uh...Ben Navis.

668
01:04:22,516 --> 01:04:24,368
Good, yes?

669
01:04:24,401 --> 01:04:28,237
Inspector Taggart, whiskey, Sean Connery.

670
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:31,212
Good, and "lochs". Their word for lakes.

671
01:04:31,442 --> 01:04:32,777
No filming.

672
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:41,631
Jamal, come here.

673
01:04:41,664 --> 01:04:43,583
I'm on "Millionaire" duty today.

674
01:04:43,617 --> 01:04:44,791
Dev!

675
01:04:45,204 --> 01:04:47,887
- Please, just for five minutes.
- I can't.

676
01:04:48,731 --> 01:04:49,436
Sit here.

677
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:52,665
If the team leader comes just pretend you're
on a call doing an upgrade for...

678
01:04:52,665 --> 01:04:54,513
- ..."Friends and Family", I know.
- Yeah.

679
01:04:54,514 --> 01:04:56,577
Two minutes.

680
01:05:00,846 --> 01:05:03,446
"Who wants to be a millionaire?"

681
01:05:03,447 --> 01:05:05,418
Dial this number now!

682
01:05:09,812 --> 01:05:11,492
Hello. Hello!

683
01:05:12,476 --> 01:05:16,336
I would like to be a contestant of
"Who wants to be a millionaire?"

684
01:05:17,185 --> 01:05:19,994
Bloody bastard. I never get it.

685
01:05:20,028 --> 01:05:22,906
You have to dial, when Prem says "if".

686
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,359
That's when they open the lines.

687
01:05:24,393 --> 01:05:25,749
How the hell do you know that?

688
01:05:25,782 --> 01:05:29,620
That's what Anjum in Technical
says. He put a system in.

689
01:05:29,653 --> 01:05:34,431
Hello? Hello? Forgetting someone there for god's sake?

690
01:05:34,465 --> 01:05:39,714
Hello? Dear god will somebody talk to me?

691
01:05:39,748 --> 01:05:44,930
Uh... Hello, Mrs MacKintosh from Kin.. gussie.

692
01:05:44,964 --> 01:05:48,802
It's Kingussie, love. Pronounced: "Kee-nu-ssi".

693
01:05:48,835 --> 01:05:51,644
So where are you from? Abroad I bet?

694
01:05:51,678 --> 01:05:55,515
Just down the road from
your house, Mrs. MacKintosh.

695
01:05:55,549 --> 01:05:57,403
Uh... Next to the "loch".

696
01:05:57,404 --> 01:06:00,022
Ok, which "loch"?

697
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:06,097
"Loch" Big... "loch" Ben... "Loch" Big Ben.

698
01:06:06,098 --> 01:06:08,468
Next door to Sean Connery's flat.

699
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:10,770
Look. I'd like to your supervisor, son?

700
01:06:16,616 --> 01:06:19,492
WHAT NAME DO YOU REQUIRE?

701
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:36,757
SEARCH COMPLETE. 26,283 RESULTS FOUND.

702
01:06:45,613 --> 01:06:49,451
15 RESULTS FOUND.

703
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,352
Yes?

704
01:06:58,385 --> 01:06:59,741
Salim?

705
01:06:59,774 --> 01:07:03,610
Who is this? Do you know what time is this?

706
01:07:11,317 --> 01:07:15,154
Hello?

707
01:07:24,745 --> 01:07:25,705
Hello?

708
01:07:26,665 --> 01:07:27,624
Hello?

709
01:07:28,548 --> 01:07:32,350
Who is this?

710
01:07:32,384 --> 01:07:35,228
I'm calling from XL5 Communications sir.

711
01:07:35,262 --> 01:07:41,016
As a valued customer, we are offering you
a free upgrade with our "Friends and...

712
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:42,899
...family"

713
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:47,730
Jamal? Is... Is that you, brother?

714
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:49,613
Where are you?

715
01:07:49,647 --> 01:07:52,525
I thought you were dead or something.

716
01:07:52,558 --> 01:07:54,410
Listen, we had to go Jamal.

717
01:07:54,444 --> 01:07:57,320
Maman's guys... they
were searching the hotel.

718
01:07:57,353 --> 01:08:02,117
Jamal? Say something, please!

719
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:04,959
Hello, Salim!

720
01:08:04,993 --> 01:08:07,871
Cambridge Circus is not in Cambridge.

721
01:08:07,905 --> 01:08:09,754
Can I ask why?

722
01:08:09,788 --> 01:08:13,625
Too obvious. There's definitely
an Oxford Circus in London

723
01:08:13,659 --> 01:08:16,502
There's a rowing race
between Oxford and Cambridge,

724
01:08:16,535 --> 01:08:19,380
so ther's probably a
Cambridge Circus too, no?

725
01:08:19,413 --> 01:08:22,224
I'll go for D. London.

726
01:08:22,258 --> 01:08:28,972
Computer-ji, lock D.

727
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:41,473
Jamal Malik, you are absolutely right.

728
01:08:47,228 --> 01:08:50,070
It's getting hot in here.

729
01:08:50,104 --> 01:08:51,030
Are you nervous?

730
01:08:51,063 --> 01:08:53,874
What?

731
01:08:53,908 --> 01:08:55,791
Am I nervous?

732
01:08:55,825 --> 01:08:58,703
It's you who's in the hot seat, my friend.

733
01:08:58,736 --> 01:09:01,547
Oh yes, sorry.

734
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:03,498
Balli, he's got prey on the run.

735
01:09:03,531 --> 01:09:05,383
Finally.

736
01:09:05,417 --> 01:09:07,302
A few hours ago...

737
01:09:07,335 --> 01:09:10,691
...you were giving chai for the phone wallas.

738
01:09:10,725 --> 01:09:14,049
And now you're richer
than they will ever be.

739
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,892
What a player!

740
01:09:16,925 --> 01:09:23,639
Ladies and gentlemen, what a player!

741
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:03,888
Jamal?

742
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:10,635
God is good, Brother. God is good.

743
01:10:22,144 --> 01:10:25,022
Maman's guys were out for
us. We just had to escape.

744
01:10:25,055 --> 01:10:27,303
- Liar.
- I left a message for you at work.

745
01:10:27,304 --> 01:10:28,603
We waited for weeks for you at Nagpur.

746
01:10:28,604 --> 01:10:32,318
- There was no message.
- Brother. I definitely left a message.

747
01:10:32,319 --> 01:10:36,362
There was no message! There was no message!
There was no message!!

748
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:42,427
I will never forgive you.

749
01:10:48,039 --> 01:10:48,735
I know.

750
01:10:53,796 --> 01:11:00,509
That used to be our slum.
Can you believe that, huh?

751
01:11:00,543 --> 01:11:05,304
We used to live right there man.

752
01:11:05,338 --> 01:11:08,147
Now is all business.

753
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:12,018
India is at the center of the world now. Brother.

754
01:11:12,052 --> 01:11:13,903
And I...

755
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:19,691
I am at the center of the center.

756
01:11:19,725 --> 01:11:24,452
This is all Javed's.

757
01:11:24,486 --> 01:11:28,322
Javed Khan? The gangster from our slum?

758
01:11:28,355 --> 01:11:29,247
You work for him?

759
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:33,119
Come on. Who else would save
us from Maman's guys, huh?

760
01:11:33,152 --> 01:11:36,932
What do you do for him?

761
01:11:36,988 --> 01:11:41,108
Anything he asks.

762
01:11:45,587 --> 01:11:51,341
He's coming. You need
to go now. Take my card.

763
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:52,267
What for?

764
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:55,177
You think them gonna let you
out of my sight again, huh?

765
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:57,095
You stay with me my younger brother.

766
01:11:57,129 --> 01:12:01,857
Now go. My place.

767
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:03,809
Salim! Where is Latika?

768
01:12:03,843 --> 01:12:06,573
Still?

769
01:12:07,645 --> 01:12:11,482
She's gone brother. Long gone.

770
01:12:11,516 --> 01:12:16,742
Now go. Go to my place.

771
01:12:38,337 --> 01:12:40,590
Ok, Sir. I'll be right there.

772
01:12:52,724 --> 01:12:56,113
Oh Lord forgive me. I
know that I have sinned.

773
01:13:00,283 --> 01:13:03,641
Oh Lord forgive me. I
know that I have sinned a lot.

774
01:13:12,848 --> 01:13:14,767
Go.

775
01:13:56,868 --> 01:13:59,220
Brother-ji, I am your new cook from the
agency. Thousands apologies!

776
01:13:59,221 --> 01:14:01,778
I'm so late for the mensa!

777
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,181
Just a minute.

778
01:14:19,041 --> 01:14:21,918
Excuse me. Excuse me.

779
01:14:21,919 --> 01:14:23,804
There's nothing about any cook.

780
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:28,633
There's a dishwasher being delivered.
Do you know anything about that?

781
01:14:28,666 --> 01:14:32,269
Oh brother, I... I'm your dishwasher.

782
01:15:31,988 --> 01:15:33,907
Jamal!

783
01:15:37,723 --> 01:15:41,771
Look at you.

784
01:15:45,821 --> 01:15:47,549
I've found you!

785
01:15:51,098 --> 01:15:53,305
Uh, I've found you.

786
01:16:00,475 --> 01:16:01,912
Your face.

787
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:03,585
You've hurt your eye.

788
01:16:03,618 --> 01:16:05,567
Why are you here?

789
01:16:07,454 --> 01:16:09,589
To see you.

790
01:16:11,256 --> 01:16:15,682
Why? You see me, now what?

791
01:16:23,726 --> 01:16:27,561
Why does everyone love this program?

792
01:16:27,595 --> 01:16:31,397
This is a chance to escape, isn't it?

793
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:35,234
Walk into another life.

794
01:16:35,268 --> 01:16:40,955
Oh, god.

795
01:16:40,989 --> 01:16:42,907
Javed will kill you. Here.

796
01:16:42,941 --> 01:16:44,791
Javed?

797
01:16:44,824 --> 01:16:48,167
You are with him?

798
01:16:55,376 --> 01:16:59,178
First, you want a dishwasher,

799
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:01,130
Now you want this fucking cook, huh?

800
01:17:01,506 --> 01:17:02,313
- He's just...
- Shut up!

801
01:17:04,006 --> 01:17:06,851
The cricket is on.

802
01:17:06,884 --> 01:17:09,211
And why you watch this shit tv?

803
01:17:09,212 --> 01:17:14,524
At least I am a millionaire.

804
01:17:14,557 --> 01:17:18,651
Come on, I am hungry. Make me a sandwich.

805
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,043
Come away with me.

806
01:17:50,076 --> 01:17:53,847
Away? Where?

807
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,668
And live out what?

808
01:17:59,668 --> 01:18:04,396
Love.

809
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:08,267
Come away with me. Now.

810
01:18:21,558 --> 01:18:23,468
Salim will help us.

811
01:18:23,611 --> 01:18:29,232
Salim? You still believe in Salim?

812
01:18:32,092 --> 01:18:35,258
Jamal, I'll be gone soon anyway.

813
01:18:35,292 --> 01:18:38,006
We're getting out of Bombay.

814
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:40,843
Where?

815
01:18:40,876 --> 01:18:42,867
You think he'd tell me?

816
01:18:43,776 --> 01:18:45,620
No! No! No!

817
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:50,128
Fuck.

818
01:19:04,853 --> 01:19:08,194
What is this shit?

819
01:19:08,195 --> 01:19:11,877
Get out! Get out!

820
01:19:14,756 --> 01:19:16,001
Motherfucker.

821
01:19:17,321 --> 01:19:22,085
Go, before he kills us both.

822
01:19:22,118 --> 01:19:24,994
- You want to do something for me?
- Anything.

823
01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:26,913
Then forget me.

824
01:19:26,947 --> 01:19:28,796
What? No.

825
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:35,544
I will wait. The VT station.
5 o'clock, every day until you come.

826
01:19:38,455 --> 01:19:41,266
I love you.

827
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:48,014
So what? It's too late, Jamal. Now go.

828
01:19:55,718 --> 01:19:56,611
So Jamal.

829
01:19:56,644 --> 01:20:01,441
Which cricketer has scored the most
first class centuries in history?

830
01:20:01,475 --> 01:20:03,374
A:Sachin Tendulkar.

831
01:20:03,408 --> 01:20:05,781
B:Ricky Ponting.

832
01:20:05,815 --> 01:20:09,381
C:Michael Slater.

833
01:20:09,415 --> 01:20:12,916
or D:Jack Hobbs.

834
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:17,745
But remember, if you answer wrong...

835
01:20:17,778 --> 01:20:22,540
...you lose everything, just like this.

836
01:20:22,573 --> 01:20:29,287
So do you want to do this?

837
01:20:48,649 --> 01:20:53,040
Dreams of so many...

838
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:54,644
...on the floor.

839
01:22:10,415 --> 01:22:12,334
Latika.

840
01:22:15,211 --> 01:22:17,130
Latika.

841
01:22:24,803 --> 01:22:26,723
Latika.

842
01:22:34,299 --> 01:22:37,177
Latika! Latika!!

843
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:46,768
Jamal! Jamal!... Jamal!

844
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,483
Go! Let's go.

845
01:22:55,019 --> 01:22:56,362
Latika!

846
01:22:57,321 --> 01:22:58,280
Jamal!

847
01:23:01,158 --> 01:23:02,117
Shut up!

848
01:23:05,955 --> 01:23:07,296
Take her!

849
01:23:07,871 --> 01:23:09,310
- Get's go!
- Jamal!

850
01:23:16,409 --> 01:23:19,287
No Jamal!

851
01:23:19,862 --> 01:23:20,821
Latika!

852
01:23:24,276 --> 01:23:25,619
Latika!

853
01:23:26,003 --> 01:23:29,359
Latika!

854
01:23:30,524 --> 01:23:34,360
Time for commercial break ladies and gentlemen.

855
01:23:34,393 --> 01:23:38,197
I know, I know. I can't stand the tension either.

856
01:23:38,231 --> 01:23:42,066
We'll be right back.

857
01:23:49,706 --> 01:23:54,501
Guy from the slums becomes
a millionaire overnight.

858
01:23:54,535 --> 01:23:59,296
You know who's the only other
person who's done that?

859
01:23:59,329 --> 01:24:01,181
Me.

860
01:24:03,133 --> 01:24:05,019
I know what it feels like.

861
01:24:05,052 --> 01:24:07,895
I know what you're being through.

862
01:24:07,928 --> 01:24:10,807
I'm not going to become a millionaire.

863
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,699
I don't know the answer.

864
01:24:13,733 --> 01:24:16,106
You said that before, yeah...

865
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:18,446
No really, this time I don't.

866
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:24,234
Come on, you can't take the money and run now.

867
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:27,126
You are on the edge of history kid.

868
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:30,493
I don't see what else I can do.

869
01:24:30,527 --> 01:24:33,790
Maybe it's written my friend.

870
01:24:33,824 --> 01:24:38,621
I don't know I just have some kind of gut
feeling, you're gonna win this.

871
01:24:38,654 --> 01:24:41,531
Trust me, Jamal.

872
01:24:42,027 --> 01:24:43,945
You're gonna win.

873
01:25:14,106 --> 01:25:16,867
Standby, everyone. We are on line in 13...

874
01:25:16,901 --> 01:25:19,627
Rakesh please give backup, man.

875
01:25:20,712 --> 01:25:22,274
Yeah, he's gone. I'm just giving...

876
01:25:24,478 --> 01:25:25,758
Come fast.

877
01:25:26,574 --> 01:25:28,464
20 seconds!

878
01:25:33,288 --> 01:25:35,207
Do the right thing and in approximately 3 minutes

879
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:38,462
you'll be as famous as me.

880
01:25:38,463 --> 01:25:39,968
10 seconds!

881
01:25:40,002 --> 01:25:44,797
And as rich as me. Almost.

882
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:47,641
5 seconds! 4... 3...

883
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:51,829
From rags to Raja. It's your destiny.

884
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:57,110
We are on. Applause and music please!

885
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,742
Jugulu out, cut!

886
01:26:07,304 --> 01:26:10,661
Welcome back to "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"!

887
01:26:10,694 --> 01:26:16,449
In the chair tonight is Jamal
Malik, as if we don't know.

888
01:26:16,482 --> 01:26:19,821
For 10 million rupees.

889
01:26:19,854 --> 01:26:23,129
To question once again.

890
01:26:23,162 --> 01:26:29,876
Which cricketer has scored the most first class centuries in history?

891
01:26:30,869 --> 01:26:32,752
No it isn't Sachin Tendulkar.

892
01:26:32,786 --> 01:26:34,637
That's a start.

893
01:26:34,671 --> 01:26:41,385
So it could be Ricky Ponting, Jack Hobbs or Michael Slater.

894
01:26:41,418 --> 01:26:44,261
I'll use a lifeline. Fifty-fifty.

895
01:26:44,295 --> 01:26:46,146
Ok.

896
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:51,934
Computer, take away the two wrong answers please.

897
01:26:51,968 --> 01:26:54,829
Well, you were right about Sachin Tendulkar.

898
01:26:54,862 --> 01:26:57,688
That leaves your fifty-fifty choice, Jamal.

899
01:26:57,722 --> 01:27:01,526
B: Ricky Ponting or D: Jack Hobbs.

900
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:05,328
What do you think?

901
01:27:05,362 --> 01:27:11,116
Decision time. For 10 million rupees.

902
01:27:11,149 --> 01:27:15,946
B: Ricky Ponting

903
01:27:15,963 --> 01:27:17,879
Or D: Jack Hobbs.

904
01:27:30,333 --> 01:27:35,591
D.

905
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:40,815
Not B?

906
01:27:40,849 --> 01:27:46,603
The Ricky Ponting, the Australian great cricketer?

907
01:27:46,637 --> 01:27:50,439
D, Jack Hobbs.

908
01:27:50,472 --> 01:27:55,202
You know?

909
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:58,112
So it could be B, Ricky Ponting?

910
01:27:58,146 --> 01:28:02,446
Or D, Jack Hobbs.

911
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:06,711
The final answer, D.

912
01:28:06,744 --> 01:28:10,580
Computer-ji D...

913
01:28:10,614 --> 01:28:17,327
...Lock D. Computer-ji lock D.

914
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:32,640
With 197 first class centuries, the answer is...

915
01:28:33,633 --> 01:28:40,280
D, Jack Hobbs!

916
01:28:40,313 --> 01:28:47,027
Jamal Malik! Millionaire!

917
01:28:47,193 --> 01:28:53,907
Do the dance! Come on! Come on!

918
01:28:55,895 --> 01:28:58,629
Well done! Well done.

919
01:29:21,555 --> 01:29:25,390
So, are you ready for the final question?

920
01:29:25,424 --> 01:29:32,071
For 20 million rupees.

921
01:29:32,104 --> 01:29:38,818
No. But maybe it's written, no?

922
01:29:38,851 --> 01:29:41,662
Maybe.

923
01:29:41,696 --> 01:29:47,930
Okay. The final question! On who wants to be a...

924
01:29:47,964 --> 01:29:54,164
Ahh... What a show ladies and gentlemen! What a show!

925
01:29:54,198 --> 01:29:55,090
Join us tomorrow night...

926
01:29:55,124 --> 01:30:01,837
...to see if Jamal Malik has made the biggest mistake
of his life by just one biggest prize, history of Indian television.

927
01:30:03,212 --> 01:30:05,689
This way.

928
01:30:10,901 --> 01:30:13,312
Great show.

929
01:30:16,702 --> 01:30:18,141
See you tomorrow ok.

930
01:30:18,174 --> 01:30:19,614
- Be on time.
- Yeah.

931
01:30:20,094 --> 01:30:22,011
Bye.

932
01:30:25,274 --> 01:30:26,809
- Let's go!
- Easy! Easy!

933
01:30:29,028 --> 01:30:30,947
- No tricks!
- What's going on?

934
01:30:37,323 --> 01:30:43,043
- He's a cheat.
- How do you know he's cheating?

935
01:30:43,077 --> 01:30:47,874
Bloody village boy. I fed him the wrong
answer, and he never should call it right.

936
01:30:47,908 --> 01:30:50,717
You gave him an answer?

937
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:56,504
Not exactly. Well that doesn't matter. That's my show!

938
01:30:56,538 --> 01:30:58,457
My fucking show!

939
01:31:08,973 --> 01:31:13,290
It is a bizarrely plausible, and yet...

940
01:31:13,323 --> 01:31:17,605
Because I'm a slumdog, a chaiwalla.

941
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:19,060
I'm a liar right?

942
01:31:19,094 --> 01:31:20,450
Most of you are.

943
01:31:20,483 --> 01:31:25,278
But you are not a liar, Mr Malik. That's for sure.

944
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:30,073
You are too truthful.

945
01:31:30,107 --> 01:31:34,834
We're done.

946
01:31:34,868 --> 01:31:36,787
I don't know where they've taken her.

947
01:31:43,534 --> 01:31:45,453
Latika.

948
01:31:53,092 --> 01:31:57,887
I went on the show, because I thought she'd be watching.

949
01:32:10,355 --> 01:32:15,150
Did Jamal Malik, an uneducated 18 year
old boy from the slums of Mumbay,

950
01:32:15,184 --> 01:32:18,954
win one crore by fair means or by foul play.

951
01:32:18,988 --> 01:32:21,831
And the crowd around me bears an even bigger question:

952
01:32:21,864 --> 01:32:24,742
Will he be back tonight to play for another 20 million rupees?

953
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:31,745
Jamal Malik, a name which has been in news
in every town, neighbourhood, villages and homes.

954
01:32:32,897 --> 01:32:40,568
18 year old Jamal Malik, is from Juhu Mumbai
and he's showing his elegance in the show
"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire".

955
01:32:41,337 --> 01:32:46,134
Jamal Malik has won 1 core rupees and just
one question away from...

956
01:32:48,051 --> 01:32:49,970
Bark!

957
01:32:50,162 --> 01:32:51,889
Come on girls!

958
01:33:00,261 --> 01:33:03,106
Hey you come here,
give me a kiss.

959
01:33:06,018 --> 01:33:08,827
Come on girls!

960
01:33:10,363 --> 01:33:12,665
Hey, move back.

961
01:33:12,698 --> 01:33:15,766
Yes buddy, I couldn't hear a thing in there.

962
01:33:16,087 --> 01:33:18,706
Look, you've to make arrangment for us
to come into the town.

963
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:29,001
As if it wasn't enough drama in a contestant reaching the final question,

964
01:33:29,035 --> 01:33:33,796
Jamal Malik was last night arrested on suspicion of fraud.

965
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:40,448
That guy. He will never come.
Ever.

966
01:33:42,462 --> 01:33:44,381
Crazy fucker.

967
01:33:50,136 --> 01:33:51,749
Go.

968
01:33:52,422 --> 01:33:53,859
Go.

969
01:33:54,851 --> 01:33:56,782
But...

970
01:33:56,912 --> 01:34:02,570
Just drive. There won't be another chance.

971
01:34:04,522 --> 01:34:06,468
He will kill you.

972
01:34:06,469 --> 01:34:07,428
Yes ok.

973
01:34:11,203 --> 01:34:14,079
I'll take care of him.

974
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:20,826
Salim, I can't.

975
01:34:23,433 --> 01:34:26,117
You have to.

976
01:34:32,122 --> 01:34:35,957
God sake will take you out of this.

977
01:34:39,017 --> 01:34:43,812
Evil what I've done please forgive me.

978
01:34:53,435 --> 01:34:59,190
Have a good life.

979
01:35:08,783 --> 01:35:10,701
Ok, alright.

980
01:35:25,054 --> 01:35:31,767
You're back on the show.

981
01:35:55,778 --> 01:35:57,696
Come on!

982
01:35:58,463 --> 01:35:59,998
Come on!

983
01:36:13,966 --> 01:36:17,770
Hey, Jamal? The millionaire? Hey son, Jamal...

984
01:36:17,804 --> 01:36:24,518
The millionaire who won 2 cores? The one with all the cash?
With 2 lakhs!

985
01:36:25,509 --> 01:36:30,272
- Go son, go with my blessing and win it all.
- Is that him?... Is that him?

986
01:36:30,306 --> 01:36:35,033
- It's him, Jamal!
- We love you Jamal!

987
01:36:35,067 --> 01:36:37,910
The nation's gripped with millionaire fever.

988
01:36:37,943 --> 01:36:41,781
As Jamal Malik, an uneducated youngman from the Juhu slum in Mumbay,

989
01:36:41,814 --> 01:36:44,976
won a staggering 10 million rupee

990
01:36:45,010 --> 01:36:47,385
on a television show who wants to be a millionaire,

991
01:36:48,495 --> 01:36:51,371
and estimated 90 million people watching us tonight

992
01:36:51,755 --> 01:36:55,305
to see if he will make a one stage further to 20 million rupees.

993
01:36:59,142 --> 01:37:00,293
Come on!

994
01:37:21,138 --> 01:37:23,023
Where is everyone? Get back in there!

995
01:37:23,056 --> 01:37:26,762
Get back to work! Now.

996
01:37:28,523 --> 01:37:30,441
Chaiwalla?

997
01:37:50,835 --> 01:37:55,632
Welcome back to who wants to be a millionaire.

998
01:37:55,665 --> 01:37:57,515
I can safetly say that tonight

999
01:37:57,549 --> 01:38:01,353
is the biggest night of both our lives.

1000
01:38:01,386 --> 01:38:04,262
Jamal Malik, the call assistant worker from Mumbay,

1001
01:38:04,296 --> 01:38:06,148
has already won 10 million.

1002
01:38:06,181 --> 01:38:08,066
He can walk away with that in his pocket

1003
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:10,976
or make the biggest gamble in television history.

1004
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:12,861
And go for the final question

1005
01:38:12,895 --> 01:38:17,690
and a staggering 20 million rupees.

1006
01:38:19,642 --> 01:38:22,487
Are you ready for that question?

1007
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,477
- Yes.
- Jamal!

1008
01:38:37,773 --> 01:38:40,066
Big reader are you, Jamal?

1009
01:38:41,954 --> 01:38:43,842
I can read.

1010
01:38:44,545 --> 01:38:47,389
Lucky.

1011
01:38:47,423 --> 01:38:53,177
In Alexandre Dumas' book, the "The Three Musketeers",

1012
01:38:53,211 --> 01:38:58,932
two of the musketeers are called Athos and Porthos.

1013
01:38:58,965 --> 01:39:01,330
What was the name of the third Musketeer?

1014
01:39:01,427 --> 01:39:02,770
Come on in, come inside baby.

1015
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,612
A: Aramis

1016
01:39:05,645 --> 01:39:09,483
B: Cardinal Richelieu

1017
01:39:09,516 --> 01:39:12,375
C: D'Artagnan

1018
01:39:12,409 --> 01:39:14,820
Or D: Planchet

1019
01:39:14,821 --> 01:39:15,780
Porthos!

1020
01:39:19,073 --> 01:39:21,917
She could be our third musketeer.

1021
01:39:21,951 --> 01:39:24,827
Final question for 20 million rupees, and he is smiling.

1022
01:39:24,861 --> 01:39:28,201
I guess you know the answer.

1023
01:39:28,235 --> 01:39:31,541
Do you believe it, I don't.

1024
01:39:31,574 --> 01:39:34,385
You don't?

1025
01:39:34,419 --> 01:39:39,214
So you take the 10 million and walk?

1026
01:39:39,248 --> 01:39:44,935
No. I'll play.

1027
01:39:44,968 --> 01:39:46,853
Let remind you, Jamal.

1028
01:39:46,887 --> 01:39:49,763
If you get the answer wrong,

1029
01:39:49,797 --> 01:39:52,608
you lose everything.

1030
01:39:52,641 --> 01:39:56,477
10 million rupees, Jamal.

1031
01:39:56,511 --> 01:40:00,281
It's a fortune.

1032
01:40:00,315 --> 01:40:03,191
I'd like to phone a friend.

1033
01:40:03,704 --> 01:40:06,995
You're going to the wire.

1034
01:40:07,028 --> 01:40:10,864
The final lifeline. Here we go.

1035
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:21,911
It's ringing!

1036
01:40:21,945 --> 01:40:26,176
Who is it?

1037
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:30,012
That's my brother's number, but...

1038
01:40:31,964 --> 01:40:37,719
The kind of brother, who go for a walk on a 20 million rupee question?

1039
01:40:37,752 --> 01:40:39,671
It's the only number I know.

1040
01:41:06,063 --> 01:41:07,981
You are on your own, Jamal.

1041
01:41:11,321 --> 01:41:17,008
Hello?

1042
01:41:17,042 --> 01:41:19,886
Hello, Jamal?

1043
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,715
I'm guessing that isn't your brother.

1044
01:41:24,748 --> 01:41:26,600
This is...

1045
01:41:26,634 --> 01:41:27,593
My name is Latika.

1046
01:41:27,627 --> 01:41:29,476
Okay, Latika.

1047
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:34,307
You want to hear the question one more time? And let's be clear about this.

1048
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:36,319
20 million rupees right on your answer, you have 30 seconds.

1049
01:41:37,376 --> 01:41:39,486
Latika.

1050
01:41:40,382 --> 01:41:43,897
- Salim!
- Jamal, please read out the question to Latika now.

1051
01:41:46,808 --> 01:41:49,617
- It is really you?
- Yes.

1052
01:41:49,651 --> 01:41:53,455
The question, Jamal. The question!

1053
01:41:53,489 --> 01:41:55,885
In Alexandre Dumas' book, the "The Three Musketeers",

1054
01:41:55,919 --> 01:41:58,283
two of the musketeers are called Athos and Porthos.

1055
01:41:58,317 --> 01:42:00,169
What was the name of the third Musketeer?

1056
01:42:00,202 --> 01:42:06,916
Was it A: Aramis, B: Cardinal Richelieu, C: D'Artagnan or D: Planchet?

1057
01:42:06,950 --> 01:42:08,849
15 seconds!

1058
01:42:08,883 --> 01:42:10,776
Where are you?

1059
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:12,699
I am safe.

1060
01:42:12,733 --> 01:42:14,554
10 seconds!

1061
01:42:14,587 --> 01:42:20,310
Uhh... Latika, what do you think?

1062
01:42:20,343 --> 01:42:26,098
I don't know. I've never known.

1063
01:42:26,131 --> 01:42:27,664
Jamal, God will ...

1064
01:42:36,647 --> 01:42:38,566
You really are on your own now, Jamal.

1065
01:42:40,996 --> 01:42:45,793
Your final answer for 20 million rupees.

1066
01:42:56,822 --> 01:42:59,633
A.

1067
01:43:00,624 --> 01:43:03,468
A, because?

1068
01:43:03,502 --> 01:43:06,390
Just... because.

1069
01:43:06,402 --> 01:43:07,976
Hey, Salim!

1070
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:12,007
You inside, you shameless Salim...

1071
01:43:12,134 --> 01:43:13,348
Final answer?

1072
01:43:13,349 --> 01:43:14,978
Latika!

1073
01:43:15,011 --> 01:43:19,808
Yes, final answer. A, Aramis.

1074
01:43:21,662 --> 01:43:25,020
Computer-ji, lock A.

1075
01:43:30,775 --> 01:43:32,982
Salim!... Salim!
Open the door! Salim!

1076
01:43:33,043 --> 01:43:36,111
Jamal Malik, call center assistant from Mumbay,

1077
01:43:36,145 --> 01:43:38,956
chaiwalla,

1078
01:43:38,989 --> 01:43:41,832
for two draws 20 million rupees

1079
01:43:44,711 --> 01:43:45,671
Open the door, Salim!

1080
01:43:45,703 --> 01:43:48,579
you were asked who the third musketeer
was in novel by Alexander Dumas.

1081
01:43:49,572 --> 01:43:53,341
You answered A, Aramis.

1082
01:43:54,334 --> 01:43:58,171
Which is. I have to tell you.

1083
01:43:58,205 --> 01:44:04,918
The right answer!

1084
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:27,919
Jamal Malik!

1085
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:29,838
