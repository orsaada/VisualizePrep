00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,700
Hello.

2
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,328
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

3
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,919
Do you want a chocolate?

4
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,925
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

5
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:44,307
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,186
You never know what you're gonna get.

7
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,946
Those must be comfortable shoes.

8
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:04,994
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

9
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,665
I wish I had shoes like that.

10
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,876
My feet hurt.

11
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,754
Mama always said there's an awful lot

12
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,049
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

13
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,136
where they're going,
where they've been.

14
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,437
I've worn lots of shoes.

15
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:39,362
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

16
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,909
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

17
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,329
She said they was my magic shoes.

18
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,582
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

19
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,342
Let's take a little walk around.

20
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,934
How do those feel?

21
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,064
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

22
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,650
as strong as I've ever seen,

23
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,112
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

24
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:25,491
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

25
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,701
Forrest!

26
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,412
Now, when I was a baby,

27
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,331
Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,

28
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,834
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

29
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,128
She said we was related to him
in some way.

30
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,587
And what he did was,

31
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,925
he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.

32
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,345
They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets

33
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,766
and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.

34
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,729
They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.

35
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,857
And anyway, that's how I got my name,

36
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,358
Forrest Gump.

37
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,193
Mama said that the "Forrest" part

38
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,822
was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,

39
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,700
well, just don't make no sense.

40
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,876
Okay... Get it, get it...

41
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,920
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

42
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,339
All right...

43
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,592
What are you all staring at?

44
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:29,138
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

45
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:34,393
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

46
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,063
lf God intended
everybody to be the same,

47
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,273
he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.

48
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:43,152
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

49
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:48,115
We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,

50
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,243
about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.

51
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,080
That's in the county of Greenbow.

52
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:58,584
Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa

53
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,586
had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,

54
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,588
something like that.

55
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,382
Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,

56
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,219
Mama decided to let those rooms out,

57
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,262
mostly to people passing through,

58
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,308
like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.

59
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,103
That's how me and Mama got money.

60
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,939
Mama was a real smart lady.

61
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:25,027
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

62
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,907
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

63
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:34,161
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

64
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:39,125
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.

65
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,418
Now, his IQ is 75.

66
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,339
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.

67
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,970
She wanted me to have
the finest education,

68
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,974
so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.

69
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,309
I met the principal and all.

70
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,688
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

71
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,024
Now, this is normal.

72
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,820
Forrest is right here.

73
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:14,201
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

74
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,580
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

75
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,790
Now, he'll be just fine.

76
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,668
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

77
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,130
He might be a bit on the slow side,

78
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,008
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

79
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,635
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

80
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,514
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.

81
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,767
We're talking about
five little points here.

82
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,105
There must be something can be done.

83
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,151
We're a progressive school system.

84
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,905
We don't want to see anybody
left behind.

85
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,242
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

86
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,372
He's on vacation.

87
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,644
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

88
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,610
You don't say much, do you?

89
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,082
"Finally, he had to try.

90
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,125
"It looked easy, but,

91
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,671
"oh, what happened.

92
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,757
-"First, there..."
-Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

93
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,885
-Vacation?
-Where Daddy went.

94
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,224
Vacation's when you go somewhere

95
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,937
and you don't ever come back.

96
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:13,070
Anyway, I guess you could say
me and Mama was on our own.

97
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,908
But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.

98
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,577
There was always folks
coming and going.

99
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:21,745
Supper.

100
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,249
-It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
-My, my. That sure looks special.

101
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,876
Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us

102
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,629
that every room
was filled with travelers.

103
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,341
You know, folks living out
of their suitcases

104
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,386
and hat cases and sample cases.

105
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,889
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime!
Forrest...

106
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,517
One time, a young man
was staying with us,

107
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,229
and he had him a guitar case.

108
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,205
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

109
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,623
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

110
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,543
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

111
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,588
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

112
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,632
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

113
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,887
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

114
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,847
Slow it down some.

115
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,893
I liked that guitar.

116
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,312
It sounded good.

117
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:34,276
I started moving around to the music,

118
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,195
swinging my hips.

119
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,325
This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,

120
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,411
and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,

121
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,080
and guess what?

122
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,261
This is not for children's eyes.

123
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,599
Some years later,
that handsome young man

124
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,227
who they called "The King,"

125
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,646
well, he'd sung too many songs,

126
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,857
had himself a heart attack,
or something.

127
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,111
Must be hard being a king.

128
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,243
You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

129
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,872
-You do your very best now, Forrest.
-I sure will, Mama.

130
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:35,170
I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.

131
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,426
Are you coming along?

132
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,012
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

133
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,265
This is the bus to school.

134
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,478
I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

135
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:56,442
-I'm Dorothy Harris.
-Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

136
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,248
This seat's taken.

137
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,210
It's taken!

138
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,970
You can't sit here.

139
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,559
You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,

140
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,020
'cause I don't remember being born.

141
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,815
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

142
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,985
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic.

143
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,781
But I do remember the first time I heard

144
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,701
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

145
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,579
You can sit here if you want.

146
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,377
I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.

147
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,172
She was like an angel.

148
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,175
Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?

149
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,932
What's wrong with your legs?

150
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:14,269
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

151
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,356
I just sat next to her on that bus

152
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,525
and had a conversation
all the way to school.

153
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,319
...my back's crooked like
a question mark.

154
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,570
These are going to make me...

155
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:28,408
And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.

156
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,911
Are you stupid or something?

157
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,997
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

158
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,294
-I'm Jenny.
-I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

159
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,797
From that day on,
we was always together.

160
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,716
Jenny and me was like
peas and carrots.

161
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,930
She taught me how to climb.

162
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,724
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

163
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,435
I showed her how to dangle.

164
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,563
"...a good little monkey and..."

165
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:02,568
She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.

166
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,657
Sometimes we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.

167
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:13,662
-Mama's gonna worry about me.
-Just stay a little longer.

168
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,667
For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.

169
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,836
Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.

170
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:24,423
She was my most special friend.

171
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,511
My only friend.

172
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:37,102
Now, my mama always told me that
miracles happen every day.

173
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,563
Some people don't think so, but they do.

174
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,192
Hey, dummy!

175
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,237
Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?

176
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,824
-"Look, I'm Forrest Gimp."
-Just run away, Forrest.

177
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,245
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

178
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,582
-Get the bikes!
-Hurry up! Let's get him!

179
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,209
-Come on!
-Look out, dummy, here we come!

180
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,128
We're gonna get you!

181
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,841
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

182
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,470
Come back here, you!

183
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,569
Run, Forrest!

184
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,071
Run!

185
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,146
Now, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you,

186
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,775
but I can run like the wind blows.

187
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,115
From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,

188
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,242
I was running!

189
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,703
He's getting away! Stop him!

190
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,154
That boy sure is a running fool.

191
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,743
Now, remember how I told you that

192
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,746
Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?

193
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,915
Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.

194
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,168
Her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five,

195
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,588
and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.

196
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,466
Jenny?

197
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,718
He was a very loving man.

198
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:19,431
He was always kissing and touching
her and her sisters.

199
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:25,604
And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.

200
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,649
Jenny, why didn't you come
to school today?

201
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,777
Daddy's taking a nap.

202
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,570
-Jenny!
-Come on!

203
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,574
Jenny, where'd you run to?

204
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,578
You'd better get back here, girl!

205
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,706
Where you at?

206
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,379
Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?

207
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,717
Jenny!

208
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,762
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

209
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,013
Jenny!

210
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,308
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

211
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,143
far, far away from here.

212
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:08,897
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

213
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,106
far, far away from here.

214
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:13,276
Mama always said
that God is mysterious.

215
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,528
Jenny!

216
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,947
He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.

217
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,156
You'd better get back here!

218
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,741
Instead,

219
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,955
he had the police say Jenny didn't
have to stay in that house no more.

220
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:29,125
She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

221
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:32,420
which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.

222
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:40,053
Some nights, Jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house,

223
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,265
just 'cause she said she was scared.

224
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,809
Scared of what, I don't know,

225
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,145
but I think it was her grandma's dog.

226
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,022
He was a mean dog.

227
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,484
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends

228
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,861
all the way up through high school.

229
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,865
-Hey, stupid!
-Quit it!

230
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,285
-Run, Forrest, run!
-Hey,

231
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,453
did you hear me, stupid?

232
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,746
-Run, Forrest!
-Come on, get in the truck!

233
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,957
Get in the truck! Let's move it!

234
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,793
Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

235
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,045
Run, Forrest! Run!

236
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,674
-You better be running, stupid!
-Come on, dummy!

237
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,138
-Haul ass, dummy!
-Yeah, you better get running!

238
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,809
Jack rabbit!

239
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,485
Yeah!

240
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,488
Go! Go! Go!

241
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,825
Run, Forrest!

242
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,415
Now, it used to be,
I ran to get where I was going,

243
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,502
I never thought it would
take me anywhere.

244
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,702
-Who in the hell is that?
-That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

245
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,538
Just a local idiot.

246
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,709
And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.

247
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,927
Forrest! Forrest! Run!

248
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,637
-Okay!
-Run!

249
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,265
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

250
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,280
You son of a bitch! Run! Go! Run!

251
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,411
No! Turn! Go!

252
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:24,259
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

253
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,261
but he sure is fast!

254
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:34,269
Now, maybe it's just me,
but college was very confusing times.

255
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,522
Federal troops enforcing a court order

256
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,608
integrated the University
of Alabama today.

257
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,901
Two negroes were admitted,

258
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,280
but only after Governor George Wallace
had carried out his symbolic threat

259
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,906
to stand in the school house door.

260
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:51,661
Governor Wallace,
I take it from that statement, that...

261
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,788
Earl, what's going on?

262
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,208
-Coons are trying to get into school.
-Coons?

263
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:58,960
When raccoons try to get
on our back porch,

264
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,837
Mama just chase them off with a broom.

265
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:05,467
Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,
and they want to go to school with us.

266
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,011
With us? They do?

267
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,473
Shortly after Governor Wallace
had carried out his promise

268
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,766
to block the doorway,

269
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,809
President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defense

270
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,895
then to use military force.

271
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,689
Here, by videotape,
is the encounter by General Graham,

272
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,068
commander of the National Guard,
and Governor Wallace.

273
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,863
...because these National Guardsmen
are here today

274
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,491
as federal soldiers for Alabamans.

275
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:33,495
They live within our borders,
they are all our brothers.

276
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,997
We are winning in this fight,

277
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,084
because we are awakening
the American people

278
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,504
to the dangers that we have spoken
about so many times,

279
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:48,885
just so evident today, the trend towards
military dictatorship in this country.

280
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,808
And so, at day's end,
the University of Alabama

281
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:57,185
in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated

282
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,271
and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone

283
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,441
had been signed up
for summer classes.

284
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,863
Ma'am, you dropped your book.
Ma'am...

285
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,366
Governor Wallace did what
he promised to do.

286
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,994
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob from gathering...

287
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,205
Say, wasn't that Gump?

288
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,376
-Nah, that couldn't be.
-It sure as hell was.

289
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,966
A few years later, that angry little man

290
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,552
at the school house door
thought it would be a good idea

291
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,804
and ran for president.

292
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,560
But somebody thought that it wasn't.

293
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:42,313
But he didn't die.

294
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,570
My bus is here.

295
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,407
-Is it the number nine?
-No, it's the number four.

296
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,577
It was nice talking to you.

297
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:02,584
I remember when that happened,
when Wallace got shot.

298
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,919
I was in college.

299
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,212
Did you go to a girls' college,

300
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,131
or to a girls-and-boys-together college?

301
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,257
It was co-ed.

302
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,051
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

303
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,470
It was a college just for girls.

304
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,765
But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.

305
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,881
That hurts.

306
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,061
Forrest! Forrest!

307
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,233
-Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
-Jesus!

308
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,442
What are you doing?

309
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,194
-He was hurting you.
-What the hell is going on here?

310
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,989
-No, he's not! Get over there!
-Who is that? Who is that?

311
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,157
-Billy, I'm sorry.
-What the hell?

312
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,826
-Just get away from me!
-Don't...

313
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,871
-Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
-Get away from me.

314
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,165
He doesn't know any better!

315
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,586
Forrest, why did you do that?

316
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,509
I brought you some chocolate.

317
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,594
I'm sorry.

318
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:42,058
-I'll go back to my college now.
-Forrest...

319
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,355
Look at you.

320
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,526
Come on. Come on.

321
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,910
Is this your room?

322
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,625
Do you ever dream, Forrest,

323
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,796
about who you're gonna be?

324
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,673
-Who I'm gonna be?
-Yeah.

325
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,633
Aren't I going to be me?

326
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:19,387
Well, you'll always be you,
just another kind of you.

327
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:23,558
You know? I want to be famous.

328
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,062
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

329
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,400
I just want to be on an empty stage

330
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,777
with my guitar, my voice.

331
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,072
Just me.

332
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,910
And I want to reach people
on the personal level.

333
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,916
I want to be able to say things,
just one-to-one.

334
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,302
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

335
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:04,599
I sit next to them in my Home
Economics class all the time.

336
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,963
-I'm... Sorry.
-It's okay.

337
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,224
It's all right.

338
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,229
-It's okay.
-Oh, I'm dizzy.

339
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,657
I bet that never happened in Home Ec.

340
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,663
No.

341
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:18,005
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

342
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,133
I don't care. I don't like her, anyway.

343
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,594
Run! Run! Run!

344
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,182
-Run! Run! Run!
-Run! Run! Run!

345
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:40,319
College ran by real fast,
'cause I played so much football.

346
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,656
They even put me on a thing
called the All-America Team,

347
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,535
where you get to meet
the President of the United States.

348
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,203
President Kennedy met
with the Collegiate

349
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,874
All-American Football Team
at the Oval Office today.

350
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,460
Now, the really good thing
about meeting

351
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:59,338
the President of the United States
is the food.

352
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,133
They put you in this little room
with just about anything

353
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,719
you'd want to eat or drink.

354
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,681
And since, number one,
I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,

355
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,434
and number two, they was free,

356
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,604
I must have drank me about
15 Dr. Peppers.

357
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,692
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

358
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,527
It's an honor, sir.

359
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,696
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

360
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,406
Very good, sir.

361
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,659
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

362
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,495
Very good, sir.

363
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:34,248
-Congratulations. How do you feel?
-I gotta pee.

364
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,210
I believe he said he had to "go pee."

365
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,311
Sometime later,
for no particular reason,

366
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,813
somebody shot that
nice young President,

367
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,316
when he was riding in his car.

368
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:05,071
And a few years after that,
somebody shot his little brother, too,

369
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,281
only he was in a hotel kitchen.

370
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:11,160
It must be hard being brothers.

371
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,371
I wouldn't know.

372
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,331
Forrest Gump.

373
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,707
Now can you believe it?

374
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:20,711
After only five years of playing football,
I got a college degree.

375
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,797
Congratulations, son.

376
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,633
Mama was so proud.

377
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,805
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
Here, I'll hold this for you.

378
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,015
Congratulations, son.

379
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,143
Have you given any thought
to your future?

380
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,313
Thought?

381
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,608
Hello, I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

382
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:45,695
Nobody gives a hunk of shit
who you are, fuzzball!

383
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,447
You're not even a low-life,
scum-sucking maggot!

384
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:52,493
Get your faggotty ass on the bus.
You're in the Army now!

385
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,620
This seat's taken.

386
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:57,873
Taken.

387
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,588
At first, it seemed like I made a mistake,

388
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,715
seeing how it was only
my induction day

389
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,551
and I was already getting yelled at.

390
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,889
You can sit down if you want to.

391
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:17,852
I didn't know who I might meet,
or what they might ask.

392
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,563
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

393
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,692
No, but I been on a real big boat.

394
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,279
I'm talking about
a shrimp-catching boat.

395
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,865
I've been working
on shrimp boats all my life.

396
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,743
I started out on my uncle's boat,
that's my mama's brother,

397
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,911
when I was about maybe nine.

398
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,166
I was just looking into buying a boat
of my own and got drafted.

399
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:45,880
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
People call me Bubba.

400
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:50,176
Just like one of them old redneck boys.
Can you believe that?

401
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,929
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

402
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,308
So, Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,

403
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,310
and his mama cooked shrimp,

404
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,440
and her mama before her
cooked shrimp,

405
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,526
and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.

406
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,819
Bubba's family knew everything

407
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,530
there was to know
about the shrimping business.

408
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,659
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

409
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,745
Matter of fact, I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

410
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,206
after I get out the Army.

411
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:23,918
Okay.

412
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:28,214
Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this Army?

413
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,841
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

414
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:34,303
God damn it, Gump!
You're a goddamn genius!

415
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,764
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

416
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,642
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!

417
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,728
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!

418
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,606
Listen up, people!

419
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:49,902
Now, for some reason, I fit in the Army
like one of them round pegs.

420
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,237
It's not really hard.

421
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:54,949
You just make your bed real neat
and remember to stand up straight,

422
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:59,036
and always answer every question
with, "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"

423
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,579
Is that clear?

424
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,790
-Yes, Drill Sergeant!
-Yes, Drill Sergeant!

425
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,585
What you do is, you just drag
your nets along the bottom.

426
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:10,423
On a good day, you can catch over
100 pounds of shrimp.

427
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,926
lf everything goes all right,
two men shrimping 10 hours,

428
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,721
less what you spend on gas, you can...

429
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,598
-Done, Drill Sergeant!
-Gump!

430
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:24,729
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly, Gump?

431
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,480
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

432
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:30,025
Jesus H. Christ,
this is a new company record.

433
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,611
lf it wouldn't be a waste
of such a damn fine enlisted man,

434
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,989
I'd recommend you for OCS,
Private Gump.

435
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,949
You are gonna be
a general some day, Gump.

436
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,119
Now, disassemble your weapon
and continue!

437
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:46,000
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

438
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:50,838
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

439
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,924
There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole...

440
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:59,054
...shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

441
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,933
There's pineapple shrimp,
lemon shrimp,

442
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,352
coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...

443
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:11,650
...shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,

444
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,779
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...

445
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,700
That's... That's about it.

446
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,373
Night time in the Army is a lonely time.

447
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,878
We'd lay there in our bunks
and I'd miss my mama.

448
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,964
And I'd miss Jenny.

449
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:41,764
Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!

450
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:58,364
Turns out, Jenny had gotten into
some trouble over

451
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,784
some photos of her
in her college sweater,

452
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,453
and she was thrown out of school.

453
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,209
But that wasn't a bad thing,

454
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,879
because a man who owns
a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,

455
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:19,009
saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.

456
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,637
The first chance I got,

457
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:25,432
I took the bus up to Memphis
to see her perform in that show.

458
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,017
That was Amber, Amber Flame.

459
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,562
Give her a big hand, guys.
Good job, Amber.

460
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,398
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

461
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:36,318
direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty,

462
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:40,114
let's give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbi Dylan.

463
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:44,952
-All right!
-Bobbi!

464
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,560
Her dream had come true.

465
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,813
She was a folk singer.

466
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,325
Come on, baby. Shake it up.
Shake it up, now.

467
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,910
Hey, buddy, get her a harmonica.

468
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,707
Hey, honey, this ain't Captain Kangaroo.

469
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,376
Hey, honey,
I got something here for you.

470
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,173
-God damn it!
-Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk!

471
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,717
I'm singing a song here.

472
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,472
Polly, get out here!

473
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,265
-Shut up, there!
-Don't be so shy, honey.

474
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,892
Oh, shut up!

475
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,314
Forrest, what are you doing here?

476
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,107
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

477
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,567
-Come on.
-What are you doing?

478
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,694
Forrest, let me down!

479
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,452
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.

480
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,621
You can't keep trying
to rescue me all the time.

481
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:14,792
-They was trying to grab you.
-A lot of people try to grab me.

482
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,879
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

483
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:22,299
I can't help it. I love you.

484
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,762
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

485
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,064
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

486
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:42,444
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

487
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,781
Yes, I do.

488
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,579
You think I could fly off this bridge?

489
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,422
What do you mean, Jenny?

490
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,802
Nothing.

491
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,807
I gotta get out of here.

492
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,185
Wait, Jenny...

493
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:19,732
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

494
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,108
Can I have a ride?

495
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,735
-Where you going?
-I don't care.

496
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,194
Get in the truck.

497
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,113
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

498
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,951
They sending me to Vietnam.

499
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,123
It's this whole other country.

500
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,627
Just hang on a minute.

501
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:45,090
Listen, you promise me
something, okay?

502
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:48,510
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

503
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,220
Just run away.

504
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:52,806
Okay.

505
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,021
Jenny.

506
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,192
I'll write you all the time.

507
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,329
And just like that, she was gone.

508
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,765
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

509
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,020
Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different

510
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,982
from the United States of America.

511
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:30,112
And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.

512
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,333
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

513
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,587
They tell me these Vietnams
are good shrimpers.

514
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:50,215
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

515
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,508
we can get American shrimpers

516
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,343
to come out here
and shrimp these waters.

517
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,970
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

518
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,265
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

519
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,851
You must be my FNGs.

520
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,186
-Morning, sir!
-Morning, sir!

521
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,897
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

522
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,107
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

523
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:10,027
who would love to grease an officer.

524
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,614
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

525
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,909
What's wrong with your lip?

526
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,369
I was born with big gums, sir.

527
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:24,166
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

528
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,710
Where you boys from in the world?

529
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,171
-Alabama, sir!
-Alabama, sir!

530
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,381
You twins?

531
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,886
No, we are not relations, sir.

532
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:41,058
Look, it's pretty basic here.

533
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,311
lf you stick with me
and learn from the guys

534
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,064
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

535
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,066
There is one item of GI gear

536
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:53,320
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

537
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,823
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

538
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,200
Try and keep your feet dry.

539
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,743
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

540
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,287
to change your socks
whenever we stop.

541
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:05,332
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

542
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,709
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

543
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,253
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

544
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,255
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

545
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

546
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:18,345
Lieutenant Dan sure knew his stuff.
I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.

547
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,557
He was from a long,
great military tradition.

548
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,852
Somebody in his family
had fought and died

549
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:31,108
in every single American war.

550
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,027
-God damn it, kick some ass!
-I'm on it, Lieutenant.

551
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,237
Get on it!

552
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,699
I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.

553
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:45,247
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

554
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,541
Little Rock's a fine town.

555
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,795
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

556
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,339
draw what you need for the field.

557
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:58,385
lf you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

558
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,346
Two standing orders in this platoon:

559
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:04,099
one, take good care of your feet,

560
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:09,271
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

561
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,821
I sure hope I don't let him down.

562
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:34,338
I got to see a lot of the countryside.
We would take these real long walks.

563
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:46,933
And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.

564
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:57,027
-Hold it up!
-Hold up, boys!

565
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:02,199
It wasn't always fun.

566
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:06,578
Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,

567
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:11,750
or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...

568
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,835
Get down! Shut up!

569
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:16,254
...so we did.

570
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,982
Now, I don't know much about anything,

571
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:39,903
but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.

572
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,697
There was Dallas, from Phoenix,

573
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,202
Cleveland, he was from Detroit.

574
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,704
Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

575
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:51,998
Man, what the hell's going on?

576
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:56,420
And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.

577
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,046
Nothing.

578
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,678
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

579
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:08,473
Still got 10 clicks to go to that river.
Move out.

580
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,350
Come on, move out.

581
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,813
Step it up. Look alive out there.

582
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:19,234
The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.

583
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,735
Fire in the hole!

584
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,533
Gump, check out that hole.

585
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,619
And there was always something to do.

586
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,873
-Mount them up.
-Spread out! Cover his back.

587
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,550
One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.

588
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,429
We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:

589
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,098
little bitty stinging rain,

590
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,477
and big old fat rain,

591
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,646
rain that flew in sideways.

592
00:46:56,731 --> 00:47:00,775
And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.

593
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,946
Shoot, it even rained at night.

594
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,450
-Hey, Forrest.
-Hey, Bubba.

595
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:11,870
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

596
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:15,790
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

597
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:20,212
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

598
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:22,797
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

599
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,799
like brothers and stuff.

600
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:30,430
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

601
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,517
I got a very important question
to ask you.

602
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:39,105
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

603
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,900
Okay.

604
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:45,445
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

605
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,323
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

606
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:51,743
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

607
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,120
We ain't got to pay no rent.

608
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,289
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

609
00:47:56,374 --> 00:48:00,627
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

610
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,297
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

611
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,634
That's a fine idea.

612
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,845
Bubba did have a fine idea.

613
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:17,727
I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.

614
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,731
I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.

615
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:26,820
I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,

616
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,656
and told her
how I thought about her always,

617
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,952
and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her

618
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,538
just as soon as she had the time.

619
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,917
I'd always let her know that I was okay.

620
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:47,382
Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump."

621
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:05,984
This one day, we was out walking,
like always,

622
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,029
and then, just like that,

623
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,366
somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.

624
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,204
Ambush!

625
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,081
Take cover!

626
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,878
Get down!

627
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,421
Get the sixty!

628
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:31,676
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

629
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,887
Forrest, you okay?

630
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,726
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

631
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,687
Medic, we got a man down!

632
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:45,732
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

633
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:49,778
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

634
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:53,406
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

635
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:55,867
Misfire! Misfire!

636
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,246
God damn it! Mac!

637
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:04,626
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

638
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:06,753
Jesus!

639
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,089
My unit is down hard and hurting!

640
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,759
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

641
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,512
Pull back! Pull back!

642
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,722
Run! Run, Forrest!

643
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:20,141
-Pull back!
-Forrest, Forrest!

644
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,852
Run, man! Run!

645
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,729
Pull back! Run!

646
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,775
Run, God damn it, run!

647
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:54,592
Medic! Can I get a medic?

648
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,304
I ran and ran, just like Jenny told me to.

649
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:05,895
I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,

650
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,939
which was a bad thing.

651
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,024
Bubba!

652
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:15,947
Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.

653
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,703
Any friendlies out there?

654
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,831
Yeah, I've got three over here.

655
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,459
Where the hell are you?

656
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,377
Bubba?

657
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:33,173
And on my way back to find Bubba,

658
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:36,092
well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.

659
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,385
Tex!

660
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:40,472
Okay.

661
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:44,517
I couldn't just let him lay there all alone,
scared the way he was,

662
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:48,521
so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.

663
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,080
And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,

664
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:09,709
somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me."

665
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,260
Can't hear... Can't hear...

666
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,847
No sweat, man. Just lay back.

667
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:25,433
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

668
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:30,480
I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.

669
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,815
...over.

670
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:35,193
Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

671
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,111
We got Charlie all over this area.

672
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:39,531
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

673
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:42,992
-Six, Strongarm, we want...
-Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

674
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,285
I know he's dead!

675
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,247
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

676
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,706
-Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.
-God damn it!

677
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,501
-Copy this transmission. Over.
-What are you doing?

678
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,921
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

679
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,340
Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.

680
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,051
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

681
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,304
Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised

682
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,390
your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.

683
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:08,893
Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.

684
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,437
Something bit me!

685
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,446
You chink son of a bitch!

686
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:24,951
I can't leave the platoon.

687
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:29,998
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

688
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,250
Did you hear what I said?

689
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,919
God damn it, put me down!

690
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,672
Get your ass out of here!

691
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,553
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

692
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:44,971
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

693
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:46,180
To get Bubba.

694
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:50,143
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

695
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,645
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

696
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,189
I gotta find Bubba!

697
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,624
Forrest.

698
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:23,051
-Bubba.
-I'm okay, Forrest.

699
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,511
I'm okay.

700
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:35,188
Oh, Bubba, no...

701
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,523
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

702
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,368
Come on. Come on. Come on.

703
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:54,874
I'm okay, Forrest.

704
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:59,045
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

705
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,210
Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

706
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:44,757
lf I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,

707
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,176
I'd of thought of something better to say.

708
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,761
Hey, Bubba.

709
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,264
Hey, Forrest.

710
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,811
Forrest, why'd this happen?

711
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,939
You got shot.

712
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,820
Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.

713
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,281
I wanna go home.

714
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,326
Bubba was my best good friend.

715
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:17,832
And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.

716
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:21,044
Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,

717
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:25,089
but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.

718
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,097
That's all I have to say about that.

719
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:37,643
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

720
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,648
-A bullet?
-That jumped up and bit you.

721
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:47,111
Oh, yes, sir.

722
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:50,323
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

723
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:55,703
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

724
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:59,665
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

725
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:04,003
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

726
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,838
is the ice cream.

727
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,549
They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.

728
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,967
And guess what?

729
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:13,179
A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.

730
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,476
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

731
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,022
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

732
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,036
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

733
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:46,879
Harper!

734
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,552
Cooper, Larson,

735
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,097
Webster,

736
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:01,018
-Gump. Gump.
-I'm Forrest Gump.

737
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:07,859
Kyle, Nichols,

738
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:16,033
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

739
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,744
Holiday...

740
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,753
Surprise, surprise, surprise!

741
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,593
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?

742
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,261
-From the DMZ to the Delta...
-Turn it off!

743
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,598
...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.

744
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:41,058
This is Channel 6, Saigon.

745
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,438
Good catch, Gump.

746
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,567
You know how to play this?

747
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,945
Come on, let me show you. Here.

748
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:57,366
Now, the secret to this game is,

749
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:03,289
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

750
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:08,211
All right.

751
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:15,218
For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.

752
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,471
See? Any idiot can play.

753
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,724
So, I started playing it all the time.

754
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,227
I played Ping-Pong

755
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:27,605
even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.

756
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:40,326
The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,

757
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:42,286
whatever that means.

758
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,998
Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.

759
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:55,383
I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.

760
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:08,271
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

761
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:11,399
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

762
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:14,193
I should have died out there
with my men,

763
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,281
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

764
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,993
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

765
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:23,828
Do you see that?

766
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:27,707
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

767
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,670
Yes, sir, I do.

768
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,384
Did you hear what I said?

769
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,012
You cheated me.

770
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,263
I had a destiny.

771
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,891
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!

772
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,604
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

773
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,950
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

774
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:08,456
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

775
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,752
I had a destiny.

776
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:19,091
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

777
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,600
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

778
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,333
Look at me.

779
01:01:53,668 --> 01:02:01,342
What am I gonna do now?

780
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,187
PFC Gump?

781
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,148
Yes, sir!

782
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:18,317
As you were.

783
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:22,655
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

784
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:27,326
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

785
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:37,837
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

786
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,548
They sent him home.

787
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:49,306
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.

788
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:53,894
The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President

789
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:57,356
regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.

790
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,567
President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor

791
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:01,318
to men
from each of the Armed Services.

792
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:04,321
America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.

793
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:10,119
I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?

794
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,372
-In the buttocks, sir.
-That must be a sight.

795
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,417
I'd kind of like to see that.

796
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,016
God damn, son.

797
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:37,980
After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,

798
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,567
so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.

799
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,778
Hilary, all right, I've got the vets,
what do you want me to do with them?

800
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:46,614
What are you doing here so late?

801
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:50,743
It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded

802
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,996
with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,

803
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,707
and some of them people were loud
and pushy.

804
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,752
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

805
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:03,547
Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.

806
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,344
Follow me, let's go!

807
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:11,764
Come on. Let's go.

808
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,396
Stand here.

809
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:25,027
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

810
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:27,446
Okay.

811
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,617
There was this man giving a little talk.

812
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:35,204
And for some reason, he was
wearing an American flag for a shirt.

813
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,747
Now, I'm gonna
bring up some soldiers...

814
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:39,625
And he liked to say the "F" word.

815
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:43,087
A lot. "F" this and "F" that.

816
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:45,506
And every time he said the "F" word,

817
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,342
people, for some reason,
well, they'd cheer.

818
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:51,512
...where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!

819
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:54,890
Yeah! Yeah!

820
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,977
Come on, man, come up here, man.

821
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:01,730
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move, move.

822
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:06,151
You can do it. Just get up there.
Go on. That's it.

823
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:21,500
Tell us a little bit about the war, man.

824
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,335
The war in Vietnam?

825
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,338
-The war in Viet-fucking-nam!
-Yeah!

826
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:47,776
Peace!

827
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:49,528
Come on, man, go!

828
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,780
-Come on!
-Peace!

829
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:52,906
Well...

830
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:56,452
There was only one thing
I could say about the war in Vietnam.

831
01:05:56,536 --> 01:06:01,373
...there's only one thing
I can say about the war in Vietnam.

832
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:08,964
In Vietnam, your...

833
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:19,808
Hey, what the hell are you...

834
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,645
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

835
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,230
Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this?

836
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,317
We can't hear you!

837
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:32,029
We can't hear anything!

838
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:35,240
-This one! This one! Give me that!
-Turn it up!

839
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:36,742
Speak up!

840
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,994
That's it!

841
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,915
...and that's all I have to say about that.

842
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:53,175
That's so right on, man. You said it all.

843
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:57,179
What's your name, man?

844
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,890
My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

845
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:02,267
Forrest Gump!

846
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:03,769
-Gump!
-Gump!

847
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:09,024
Forrest! Forrest!

848
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:15,447
-Jenny!
-Forrest!

849
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:34,883
Hey! Hey!

850
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:46,103
It was the happiest moment of my life.

851
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,817
Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.

852
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:54,737
She showed me around,

853
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,406
and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.

854
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,824
Shut that blind, man.

855
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:01,160
And get your white ass
away from that window.

856
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,328
Don't you know we in a war here?

857
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:05,581
Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool.
He's one of us.

858
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:07,583
-Let me tell you about us.
-Where the hell have you been?

859
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,752
Our purpose here
is to protect our black leaders

860
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:11,587
from the racial onslaught of the pig

861
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:13,756
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

862
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,176
rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.

863
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,014
Who's the baby killer?

864
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,850
This is my good friend I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.

865
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,685
Forrest, this is Wesley.

866
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,061
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,

867
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,773
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

868
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,274
Let me tell you something else.

869
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:36,612
We are here to offer protection and help
for all of those who need our help,

870
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:40,282
because we, the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam.

871
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:44,036
Yes, we are against any war where
black soldiers are sent to the frontline

872
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,038
to die for a country that hates them.

873
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:49,291
Yes, we are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

874
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:52,461
and come to be brutalized and killed
in their own communities

875
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,129
as they sleep in their beds at night.

876
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:55,380
You are a fucking asshole!

877
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:58,842
Yes, we are against all these racist
and imperial dog acts.

878
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:11,355
Forrest! Quit it! Quit it!

879
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:14,566
Forrest!

880
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,902
Stop it! Stop it!

881
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:24,910
Oh, God...

882
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,163
I shouldn't have brought you here.

883
01:09:28,248 --> 01:09:31,875
I should have known it was just
gonna be some bullshit hassle.

884
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:35,671
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

885
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,344
Come on, Forrest.

886
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:52,062
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

887
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,276
He doesn't mean it when
he does things like this. He doesn't.

888
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,695
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

889
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,782
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

890
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:08,287
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

891
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:21,216
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

892
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:25,804
You look handsome in it. You do.

893
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,810
-You know what?
-What?

894
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,067
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

895
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,404
Me, too, Forrest.

896
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:47,159
We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talking.

897
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:52,414
She told me about
all the traveling she'd done.

898
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:57,085
And how she'd discovered ways
to expand her mind

899
01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:00,255
and learn how to live in harmony,

900
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,674
which must be out west somewhere,

901
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,093
'cause she made it
all the way to California.

902
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,429
Try to love one another right now

903
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,680
Hey!

904
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:12,184
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

905
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,144
-I'll go.
-Far out.

906
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:18,774
It was a very special night
for the two of us.

907
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,444
I didn't want it to end.

908
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:25,656
I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

909
01:11:26,658 --> 01:11:28,450
I have to, Forrest.

910
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:30,702
Jenny?

911
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:35,457
Things got a little out of hand.

912
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:39,378
It's just this war
and that lying son of a bitch, Johnson!

913
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,840
I would never hurt you, you know that.

914
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,971
You know what I think?

915
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:55,727
I think you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!

916
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:11,326
Forrest, we have very different lives,
you know.

917
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:23,922
I want you to have this.

918
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,762
Forrest, I can't keep this.

919
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:36,685
I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.

920
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:40,897
Why are you so good to me?

921
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,942
You're my girl.

922
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:48,071
I'll always be your girl.

923
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:33,325
And just like that, she was gone,
out of my life again.

924
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,162
That's one small step for man,

925
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:42,000
one giant leap for mankind.

926
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:50,175
I thought I was going back to Vietnam,

927
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:53,512
but instead, they decided the best way
for me to fight the Communists

928
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:55,222
was to play Ping-Pong.

929
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:57,599
So, I was in the Special Services,

930
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,936
traveling around the country
cheering up all them wounded veterans

931
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,438
and showing them
how to play Ping-Pong.

932
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:05,440
I was so good that some years later

933
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:09,152
the Army decided that I should be
on the All-American Ping-Pong team.

934
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:12,197
We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China

935
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,699
in like a million years,
or something like that.

936
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:18,245
Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,

937
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:21,123
but all I did was play Ping-Pong.

938
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:24,292
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity.

939
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,295
Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

940
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:30,048
Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.

941
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,557
Mr. Gump, have a seat.

942
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,228
Forrest Gump, John Lennon.

943
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,147
-Welcome home.
-You had quite a trip.

944
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:48,567
Can you tell us, what was China like?

945
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:57,075
In the land of China,
people hardly got nothing at all.

946
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,743
No possessions?

947
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:04,583
And in China, they never go to church.

948
01:15:05,877 --> 01:15:07,586
No religion, too?

949
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,799
-Hard to imagine.
-Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

950
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:16,970
Some years later,
that nice young man from England

951
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,681
was on his way home
to see his little boy

952
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,767
and was signing some autographs,

953
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:26,855
and for no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.

954
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:33,737
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

955
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:37,115
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

956
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:41,536
Lieutenant Dan!

957
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:46,082
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor!

958
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,461
Yes, sir, they surely did.

959
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,546
They gave you,

960
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:55,800
an imbecile,
a moron who goes on television

961
01:15:55,885 --> 01:16:00,138
and makes a fool out of himself
in front of the whole damn country,

962
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,308
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

963
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:05,644
Yes, sir.

964
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,649
Well, then, that's just perfect!

965
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,903
Yeah, well,
I just got one thing to say to that.

966
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,239
God damn bless America.

967
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:19,449
Hey!

968
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:22,577
Oh, God!

969
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:27,499
-Oh, God!
-Lieutenant Dan!

970
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:31,378
Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel.

971
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:33,421
And because he didn't have no legs,

972
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:36,675
he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.

973
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:42,013
Take a right. Take a right.

974
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:47,185
Hey! Come on, already!

975
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:50,063
What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?

976
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:52,691
I'm living off the government tit.

977
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:55,694
Sucking it dry!

978
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:57,821
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind?

979
01:16:57,905 --> 01:16:59,614
-I'm walking here!
-Get out of the way!

980
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,284
Get out! Come on, go! Go! Go!

981
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:13,086
I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.

982
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:20,927
You have a great year.
Hurry home and God bless you.

983
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:26,725
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

984
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:31,980
I didn't know I was supposed to be
looking for him, sir.

985
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:41,948
That's all these cripples,
down at the VA,

986
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:44,451
that's all they ever talk about.

987
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:48,580
Jesus this and Jesus that.

988
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:52,334
Have I found Jesus?

989
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,962
They even had a priest come
and talk to me.

990
01:17:56,839 --> 01:18:01,509
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

991
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,180
How if I accept Jesus into my heart,

992
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:09,976
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

993
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:12,228
Did you hear what I said?

994
01:18:13,272 --> 01:18:17,275
Walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

995
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,320
Well, kiss my crippled ass.

996
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:23,782
God is listening? What a crock of shit.

997
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:30,080
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

998
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:33,041
Oh?

999
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,255
Well,

1000
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:45,595
before you go, why don't you get
your ass down to the corner

1001
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:48,181
-and get us another bottle of Ripple.
-Yes, sir.

1002
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:53,395
We are at approximately 45th Street
in New York City at One Astor Plaza.

1003
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,313
This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.

1004
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:57,607
What the hell is in Bayou La Batre?

1005
01:18:57,691 --> 01:19:00,026
-Shrimping boats.
-Shrimping boats?

1006
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:02,529
Who gives a shit
about shrimping boats?

1007
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:04,072
I gotta buy me
one of them shrimping boats,

1008
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,698
soon as I have some money.

1009
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:08,618
I made me a promise to Bubba
in Vietnam

1010
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:11,413
that as soon as the war was over,
we'd go in partners.

1011
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:14,916
He'd be the captain of the
shrimping boat and I'd be his first mate.

1012
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,461
But now that he's dead,
that means I gotta be the captain.

1013
01:19:18,546 --> 01:19:21,256
-A shrimp boat captain.
-Yes, sir.

1014
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:24,092
A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1015
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,054
Now hear this!

1016
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:32,642
Private Gump here
is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.

1017
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:34,811
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan,

1018
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:37,355
the day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1019
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,984
-I will come and be your first mate.
-Okay.

1020
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:45,405
lf you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut.

1021
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:48,491
Danny, what are
you complaining about?

1022
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:51,161
-What are you doing, hon?
-Mr. Hot Wheels.

1023
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:54,873
-Who's your friend?
-My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.

1024
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:59,919
This is Cunning Carla
and Long-Limbs Lenore.

1025
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:04,215
So, where you been, baby cakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.

1026
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,758
You know, you should have
been here for Christmas,

1027
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:07,177
'cause Tommy bought a round
on the house

1028
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:08,761
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

1029
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:11,890
Well, well, I had company.

1030
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:16,436
Hey, hey! We was just there.
That's at Times Square.

1031
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:21,191
Don't you just love New Year's?
You get to start all over.

1032
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:24,569
-Hey, Lenore...
-Everybody gets a second chance.

1033
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:27,197
It's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,

1034
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:29,574
I began to think about Jenny,

1035
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:34,954
wondering how she was spending
her New Year's night out in California.

1036
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:01,064
...eight, seven, six, five,

1037
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:04,651
four, three, two, one!

1038
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:07,445
Happy New Year!

1039
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:26,631
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

1040
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:05,587
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?

1041
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,672
What's his problem?

1042
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,008
Did you lose your pecker in the war
or something?

1043
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:12,135
What, is your friend stupid
or something?

1044
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:13,303
What did you say?

1045
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:14,804
I said, is your friend stupid
or something?

1046
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:17,056
Hey! Don't call him stupid!

1047
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:19,100
-Hey, don't you push her!
-You shut up!

1048
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:21,227
-Don't you ever call him stupid!
-What's the matter, baby?

1049
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,021
-Why are you so upset?
-Just get the hell out of here.

1050
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:24,188
-Stupid damn...
-Get your goddamn clothes...

1051
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:25,773
You belong in Ripley's Believe It Or Not!

1052
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:27,734
-Get the hell out of here!
-You should be in a sideshow!

1053
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:28,860
Go on! Get out of here!

1054
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,236
Come on, Lenore.
We don't need this shit!

1055
01:22:30,321 --> 01:22:31,696
Get out of here!

1056
01:22:33,324 --> 01:22:35,867
-You retard.
-Loser. You freak.

1057
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:42,457
No, no.

1058
01:23:07,608 --> 01:23:11,569
I'm sorry I ruined your
New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

1059
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:14,447
She tasted like cigarettes.

1060
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:35,134
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's
some things you just can't change.

1061
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:40,348
He didn't want to be called crippled,
just like I didn't want to be called stupid.

1062
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:47,730
Happy New Year, Gump.

1063
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:53,903
The US Ping-Pong team

1064
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:56,280
met with President Nixon today
at an Oval Office ceremony...

1065
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:59,117
And wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

1066
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:03,162
they invited me and the Ping-Pong team
to visit the White House.

1067
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:05,498
So, I went, again.

1068
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:09,794
And I met the President
of the United States, again.

1069
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,506
Only, this time, they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.

1070
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:16,968
So, are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?

1071
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:20,054
-Yes, sir.
-Well, where are you staying?

1072
01:24:20,139 --> 01:24:22,765
-It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

1073
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:25,977
I know of a much nicer hotel.
It's brand-new, very modern.

1074
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,062
I'll have my people
take care of it for you.

1075
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:29,814
Security, Frank Wills.

1076
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:33,484
Yeah, sir, you might want
to send a maintenance man

1077
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:36,237
over to that office across the way.

1078
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:39,198
The lights are off, and they must be
looking for a fuse box or something,

1079
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,993
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1080
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,703
Okay, sir. I'll check it out.

1081
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:45,496
-Thank you.
-No problem.

1082
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,498
-Good night.
-Good night.

1083
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:56,507
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.

1084
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,634
Vice President Ford

1085
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:03,222
will be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.

1086
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,395
As I recall the high hopes for America
with which we began this second term...

1087
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,194
Sergeant Gump.

1088
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:18,905
-Yes, sir!
-As you were.

1089
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:22,116
I have your discharge papers.
Your service is up, son.

1090
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:28,289
Does this mean
I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1091
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:30,333
For the Army it does.

1092
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:37,840
And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.

1093
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,931
So, I went home.

1094
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:09,831
-I'm home, Mama.
-I know, I know.

1095
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,000
-Louise, he's here.
-Now, when I got home,

1096
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:17,129
I had no idea,
but Mama had had all sorts of visitors.

1097
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:19,549
We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest.

1098
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:22,718
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1099
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:26,597
One man even left a check for $25,000

1100
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:30,142
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you liked using their paddle.

1101
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:32,937
Oh, but, Mama,
I only like using my own paddle.

1102
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,022
-Hi, Miss Louise.
-Hey, Forrest.

1103
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:38,025
I know that. I know that.

1104
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:40,778
But it's $25,000, Forrest.

1105
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:45,533
I thought maybe you could hold it
for a while, see if it grows on you.

1106
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:47,743
-Oh, you look good, Forrest.
-That Mama, she sure was right.

1107
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:50,329
-You look real good.
-It's funny how things work out.

1108
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:53,583
I didn't stay home for long,
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,

1109
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:55,918
and I always try to keep my promise.

1110
01:26:56,003 --> 01:26:57,545
So, I went on down to Bayou La Batre

1111
01:26:57,629 --> 01:27:01,382
to meet Bubba's family
and make their introduction.

1112
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:05,136
Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

1113
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:08,097
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

1114
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:09,557
I guess.

1115
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:14,145
And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.

1116
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:18,691
Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump.

1117
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:25,865
I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

1118
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:35,458
I'm taking the $24,562
and 47 cents that I got...

1119
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:40,129
Or, that's left after a new hair cut
and a new suit,

1120
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:42,173
and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,

1121
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:45,509
and I bought a bus ticket
and three Dr. Peppers.

1122
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:47,845
Tell me something.

1123
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:51,015
Are you stupid or something?

1124
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:53,142
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1125
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:56,187
Well, that's what's left after me saying,

1126
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:59,231
"When I was in China
on the All-America Ping-Pong team,

1127
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:03,152
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong with
my Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle,"

1128
01:28:03,236 --> 01:28:04,487
which everybody knows isn't true,

1129
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:05,947
but Mama says it's just a little white lie

1130
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:08,199
so it wouldn't hurt nobody.

1131
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:15,539
So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas,
ropes and new nets

1132
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,042
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1133
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:42,984
Now, Bubba had told me everything
he knew about shrimping,

1134
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,403
but you know what I found out?

1135
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:49,407
Shrimping is tough.

1136
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:53,452
I only caught five.

1137
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:56,914
A couple more,
you could have yourself a cocktail.

1138
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,003
Hey, you ever think
about naming this old boat?

1139
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:04,755
It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.

1140
01:29:07,134 --> 01:29:11,971
I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one I could think of,

1141
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:16,350
the most beautiful name
in the wide world.

1142
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:40,207
Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,

1143
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:42,835
but I thought about her a lot,

1144
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:46,422
and I hoped that whatever
she was doing made her happy.

1145
01:31:32,696 --> 01:31:35,239
I thought about Jenny all the time.

1146
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:01,056
Hey!

1147
01:32:24,915 --> 01:32:29,585
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1148
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:33,589
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1149
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:37,426
But you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1150
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,803
Yes, I know that.

1151
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:42,181
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1152
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:46,852
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.

1153
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:55,361
And I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain

1154
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:58,072
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.

1155
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:01,283
-I am a man of my word.
-Okay.

1156
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:05,371
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "sir."

1157
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:06,830
No, sir.

1158
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:18,008
That's my boat.

1159
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:26,058
I have a feeling if we head due east,
we'll find some shrimp,

1160
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:27,768
so take a left.

1161
01:33:29,187 --> 01:33:32,106
-Take a left!
-Which way?

1162
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:34,858
Over there! They're over there!

1163
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:39,363
-Get on the wheel and take a left!
-Okay.

1164
01:33:40,573 --> 01:33:44,702
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

1165
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:50,708
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

1166
01:33:52,294 --> 01:33:53,877
That's where we'll find them.

1167
01:34:06,558 --> 01:34:10,686
-Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
-Okay, so I was wrong.

1168
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:14,606
How are we going to find them?

1169
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:17,234
Well, maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1170
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:26,535
So, I went to church every Sunday.

1171
01:34:27,787 --> 01:34:29,788
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,

1172
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:32,916
though I think
he left the praying up to me.

1173
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:52,770
-No shrimp.
-Where the hell's this God of yours?

1174
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:59,318
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
'cause right then, God showed up.

1175
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:21,006
-You'll never sink this boat!
-Now, me, I was scared,

1176
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:24,176
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

1177
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:25,636
Come on!

1178
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:33,977
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1179
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:40,484
It's time for a showdown! You and me!

1180
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:44,488
I'm right here! Come and get me!

1181
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:50,160
You'll never sink this boat!

1182
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:54,373
Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,

1183
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:57,042
destroying nearly everything in its path.

1184
01:35:57,168 --> 01:35:59,670
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

1185
01:35:59,838 --> 01:36:02,214
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

1186
01:36:02,298 --> 01:36:06,176
has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.

1187
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:09,430
Speaking with local officials,
this reporter has learned,

1188
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:12,975
in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.

1189
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:15,978
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1190
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:18,689
After that, shrimping was easy.

1191
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:27,489
Since people still needed
them shrimps for shrimp cocktails

1192
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:31,702
and barbecues and all,
and we were the only boat left standing,

1193
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:35,122
Bubba-Gump Shrimp's what they got.

1194
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:39,793
We got a whole bunch of boats,
12 Jennys,

1195
01:36:39,878 --> 01:36:43,380
a big old warehouse. We even have
hats that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

1196
01:36:43,715 --> 01:36:47,009
Bubba-Gump Shrimp.
It's a household name.

1197
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:48,927
Hold on there, boy.

1198
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:53,599
Are you telling me you're the owner of
the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1199
01:36:53,725 --> 01:36:56,727
Yes, sir. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1200
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:02,399
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
but that tops them all.

1201
01:37:05,111 --> 01:37:07,905
We was sitting next to a millionaire.

1202
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:16,038
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,

1203
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:21,084
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

1204
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:25,464
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1205
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,090
Well, yes, I would.

1206
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:34,348
That's him right there.

1207
01:37:36,476 --> 01:37:38,727
And let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan...

1208
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:40,938
Forrest,

1209
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:49,279
I never thanked you for saving my life.

1210
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:21,603
He never actually said so,
but I think he made his peace with God.

1211
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:31,488
For the second time in 17 days,

1212
01:38:31,614 --> 01:38:35,075
President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.

1213
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,451
Base to Jenny 1.

1214
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:40,038
-Base to Jenny 1.
-Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

1215
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:41,623
Forrest has a phone call.

1216
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:44,209
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

1217
01:38:44,294 --> 01:38:47,671
-He is indisposed at the moment.
-His mama's sick.

1218
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:10,736
-Where's Mama?
-She's upstairs.

1219
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:15,532
Hi, Forrest.

1220
01:39:16,492 --> 01:39:19,036
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right.

1221
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:28,879
We sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1222
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:44,186
-What's the matter, Mama?
-I'm dying, Forrest.

1223
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:49,900
Come on in, sit down over here.

1224
01:40:04,248 --> 01:40:07,751
-Why are you dying, Mama?
-It's my time.

1225
01:40:08,753 --> 01:40:10,629
It's just my time.

1226
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:16,259
Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

1227
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:20,263
Death is just a part of life,

1228
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:23,892
something we're all destined to do.

1229
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:30,107
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

1230
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:34,528
-I did the best I could.
-You did good, Mama.

1231
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:40,492
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1232
01:40:41,994 --> 01:40:45,247
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1233
01:40:49,127 --> 01:40:51,253
What's my destiny, Mama?

1234
01:40:53,423 --> 01:40:56,633
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1235
01:40:57,927 --> 01:41:00,887
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1236
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:03,140
You never know
what you're going to get.

1237
01:41:03,266 --> 01:41:07,644
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

1238
01:41:07,729 --> 01:41:09,938
I will miss you, Forrest.

1239
01:41:11,774 --> 01:41:15,819
She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.

1240
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:20,657
I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.

1241
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:26,997
And that's all I have to say about that.

1242
01:41:33,838 --> 01:41:36,131
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

1243
01:41:36,215 --> 01:41:39,009
There'll be another one along shortly.

1244
01:41:42,847 --> 01:41:46,433
Now, because I had been a football star,
and a war hero,

1245
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:49,644
and a national celebrity,
and a shrimping boat captain,

1246
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:53,356
and a college graduate,
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama

1247
01:41:53,483 --> 01:41:56,693
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1248
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:01,740
So, I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,

1249
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:04,576
though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.

1250
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:09,289
He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.

1251
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:10,957
And so then, I got a call from him saying

1252
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:14,503
we don't have to worry about money
no more, and I said,

1253
01:42:14,587 --> 01:42:16,880
"That's good. One less thing."

1254
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:23,303
Now, Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,

1255
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:27,432
and the rest is just for showing off.

1256
01:42:27,517 --> 01:42:31,394
So, I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare gospel church,

1257
01:42:34,065 --> 01:42:38,568
and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.

1258
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:45,450
And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1259
01:42:45,576 --> 01:42:48,203
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

1260
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,125
You know what?

1261
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:58,380
She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.

1262
01:42:58,464 --> 01:43:00,090
That smells wonderful.

1263
01:43:00,925 --> 01:43:04,845
And 'cause I was a gazillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,

1264
01:43:04,929 --> 01:43:07,264
I cut that grass for free.

1265
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:13,937
But at night time
when there was nothing to do

1266
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:16,398
and the house was all empty,

1267
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,776
I'd always think of Jenny.

1268
01:44:23,466 --> 01:44:26,635
And then, she was there.

1269
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:02,796
-Hello, Forrest.
-Hello, Jenny.

1270
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:16,977
Jenny came back and stayed with me.

1271
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:22,232
Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,

1272
01:45:22,358 --> 01:45:26,069
or maybe it was because she was
so tired, 'cause she went to bed

1273
01:45:26,195 --> 01:45:30,156
and slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.

1274
01:45:31,409 --> 01:45:33,702
It was wonderful having her home.

1275
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:40,166
Every day we'd take a walk and
I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

1276
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:42,794
and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging,
and shrimping,

1277
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:47,173
and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.

1278
01:45:47,258 --> 01:45:50,593
Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

1279
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,970
How could you do this?

1280
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:14,260
Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.

1281
01:47:16,472 --> 01:47:20,975
I never really knew why she came back,
but I didn't care.

1282
01:47:21,143 --> 01:47:25,438
It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.

1283
01:47:27,525 --> 01:47:31,861
Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,

1284
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:36,950
and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.

1285
01:47:37,034 --> 01:47:39,869
-New shoes.
-They make them just for running.

1286
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:48,169
And she even showed me
how to dance.

1287
01:47:56,345 --> 01:48:00,557
And, well, we was like family,
Jenny and me.

1288
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:07,230
And it was the happiest time in my life.

1289
01:48:26,876 --> 01:48:28,668
...and this Fourth is witnessing
one of the

1290
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:31,754
largest fireworks displays
in the nation's...

1291
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:34,757
-You done watching it?
-...here in New York Harbor...

1292
01:48:34,884 --> 01:48:36,676
-I'm going to bed.
-...with a spectacular display

1293
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:39,804
of tall ships earlier.
The Statue of Liberty...

1294
01:48:46,854 --> 01:48:48,855
Will you marry me?

1295
01:48:53,777 --> 01:48:56,738
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1296
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:01,451
You would, Forrest.

1297
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:05,622
But you won't marry me.

1298
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:10,126
You don't want to marry me.

1299
01:49:13,714 --> 01:49:16,132
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1300
01:49:21,138 --> 01:49:23,264
I'm not a smart man,

1301
01:49:24,975 --> 01:49:27,393
but I know what love is.

1302
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:05,682
Jenny.

1303
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:10,103
Forrest, I do love you.

1304
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:06,909
-Where are you running off to?
-I'm not running.

1305
01:52:38,502 --> 01:52:43,840
That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.

1306
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:49,429
So, I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there,

1307
01:52:49,513 --> 01:52:51,264
I thought maybe I'd run
to the end of town.

1308
01:52:51,348 --> 01:52:54,600
President Carter, suffering from heat
exhaustion, fell into the arms of...

1309
01:52:54,685 --> 01:52:56,352
And when I got there,

1310
01:52:56,437 --> 01:53:00,606
I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.

1311
01:53:00,691 --> 01:53:03,109
And I figured since I'd run this far,

1312
01:53:03,193 --> 01:53:06,446
maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.

1313
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:07,738
And that's what I did.

1314
01:53:08,365 --> 01:53:10,158
I ran clear across Alabama.

1315
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:14,370
For no particular reason,
I just kept on going.

1316
01:53:15,706 --> 01:53:17,290
I ran clear to the ocean.

1317
01:53:23,172 --> 01:53:26,340
And when I got there,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1318
01:53:26,884 --> 01:53:29,719
might as well turn around
and just keep on going.

1319
01:53:33,474 --> 01:53:38,060
And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1320
01:53:39,855 --> 01:53:43,566
I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.

1321
01:53:44,735 --> 01:53:49,572
When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.

1322
01:53:49,656 --> 01:53:52,700
When I had to go, you know...

1323
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:55,495
I went.

1324
01:53:55,579 --> 01:53:58,581
And so, you just ran.

1325
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:01,417
Yeah.

1326
01:54:36,703 --> 01:54:41,958
I'd think a lot about Mama
and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.

1327
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:46,462
But most of all, I thought about Jenny.

1328
01:54:47,548 --> 01:54:49,715
I thought about her a lot.

1329
01:54:50,467 --> 01:54:53,553
For more than two years now,
a man named Forrest Gump,

1330
01:54:53,637 --> 01:54:57,056
a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,

1331
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:59,308
has been running across America.

1332
01:54:59,393 --> 01:55:01,394
Charles Cooper brings us this report.

1333
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:04,730
For the fourth time
on his journey across America,

1334
01:55:04,815 --> 01:55:07,650
Forrest Gump,
the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,

1335
01:55:07,776 --> 01:55:10,653
is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.

1336
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,322
-I'll be damned. Forrest?
-Sir, why are you running?

1337
01:55:13,407 --> 01:55:14,490
Why are you running?

1338
01:55:14,575 --> 01:55:16,158
Are you doing this for world peace?

1339
01:55:16,243 --> 01:55:17,577
Are you doing this for the homeless?

1340
01:55:17,661 --> 01:55:20,663
-Are you running for women's rights?
-Or for the environment?

1341
01:55:20,747 --> 01:55:21,747
Or for animals?

1342
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:24,750
They just couldn't believe that
somebody would do all that running

1343
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:26,210
for no particular reason.

1344
01:55:26,295 --> 01:55:28,254
Why are you doing this?

1345
01:55:28,338 --> 01:55:33,342
I just felt like running.

1346
01:55:33,468 --> 01:55:36,679
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.

1347
01:55:37,514 --> 01:55:42,643
Now, for some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.

1348
01:55:42,811 --> 01:55:44,937
I mean, it was like an alarm
went off in my head, you know?

1349
01:55:45,022 --> 01:55:46,856
I said,
"Here's a guy that's got his act together.

1350
01:55:46,982 --> 01:55:48,941
"Here's somebody
who's got it all figured out.

1351
01:55:49,026 --> 01:55:53,112
"Here's somebody who has the answer."
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1352
01:55:53,196 --> 01:55:55,031
So, I got company.

1353
01:55:56,867 --> 01:56:02,705
And after that, I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.

1354
01:56:05,167 --> 01:56:08,377
Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.

1355
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:13,549
Now... Now, I don't know
anything about that,

1356
01:56:14,384 --> 01:56:16,969
but some of those people
asked me if I could help them out.

1357
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:20,431
Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering
if you might help me, huh?

1358
01:56:20,515 --> 01:56:22,266
Listen, I'm in the
bumper sticker business

1359
01:56:22,351 --> 01:56:24,101
and I've been trying
to think up a good slogan.

1360
01:56:24,186 --> 01:56:27,313
And since you have been such a big
inspiration to the people around here,

1361
01:56:27,397 --> 01:56:29,315
I thought you might
be able to help me jump into...

1362
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:33,027
Whoa, man! You just ran through
a big pile of dog shit!

1363
01:56:34,571 --> 01:56:37,239
-It happens.
-What, shit?

1364
01:56:38,742 --> 01:56:40,701
Sometimes.

1365
01:56:42,579 --> 01:56:45,247
And some years later,
I heard that that fellow

1366
01:56:45,332 --> 01:56:46,957
did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan,

1367
01:56:47,042 --> 01:56:50,252
and he made a lot of money off of it.

1368
01:56:51,713 --> 01:56:53,923
Another time, I was running along,

1369
01:56:54,049 --> 01:56:57,343
somebody who had lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,

1370
01:56:57,427 --> 01:56:59,470
he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,

1371
01:56:59,554 --> 01:57:02,515
but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.

1372
01:57:02,599 --> 01:57:06,102
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

1373
01:57:10,941 --> 01:57:12,608
Have a nice day.

1374
01:57:14,236 --> 01:57:15,361
Well, some years later,

1375
01:57:15,445 --> 01:57:19,365
I found out that that man
did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.

1376
01:57:19,449 --> 01:57:21,826
He made a lot of money off of it.

1377
01:57:24,621 --> 01:57:29,041
Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.

1378
01:57:30,293 --> 01:57:31,460
My mama always said,

1379
01:57:31,545 --> 01:57:35,965
"You got to put the past behind you
before you can move on."

1380
01:57:37,634 --> 01:57:40,970
And I think that's what
my running was all about.

1381
01:57:41,805 --> 01:57:45,808
I had run for three years, two months,

1382
01:57:46,059 --> 01:57:48,394
14 days and 16 hours.

1383
01:58:04,077 --> 01:58:06,412
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1384
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:19,592
I'm pretty tired.

1385
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:24,472
Think I'll go home now.

1386
01:58:43,033 --> 01:58:45,493
Now what are we supposed to do?

1387
01:58:46,453 --> 01:58:50,706
And just like that,
my running days was over.

1388
01:58:52,667 --> 01:58:54,418
So, I went home to Alabama.

1389
01:58:55,212 --> 01:58:59,381
Moments ago, at 2:25 p.m.,
as President Reagan was leaving the...

1390
01:59:01,134 --> 01:59:05,304
...five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.

1391
01:59:05,806 --> 01:59:08,140
The President was shot in the chest,
and the assailant...

1392
01:59:08,225 --> 01:59:10,184
I picked up the mail.

1393
01:59:10,977 --> 01:59:14,814
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny,

1394
01:59:14,898 --> 01:59:19,151
wondering if I could come down
to Savannah and see her,

1395
01:59:19,236 --> 01:59:21,821
and that's what I'm doing here.

1396
01:59:21,905 --> 01:59:24,490
She saw me on TV, running.

1397
01:59:24,574 --> 01:59:28,828
I'm supposed to go on the
number nine bus to Richmond Street

1398
01:59:28,912 --> 01:59:35,835
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

1399
01:59:35,919 --> 01:59:39,588
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1400
01:59:39,714 --> 01:59:44,260
Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

1401
01:59:46,096 --> 01:59:48,430
-Down that way?
-Down that way.

1402
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:53,352
It was nice talking to you.

1403
01:59:54,396 --> 01:59:57,022
I hope everything works out for you!

1404
02:00:04,781 --> 02:00:06,448
Hey!

1405
02:00:06,867 --> 02:00:08,534
Forrest!

1406
02:00:08,785 --> 02:00:12,037
How you doing? Come in, come in!

1407
02:00:12,122 --> 02:00:13,330
I got your letter.

1408
02:00:13,415 --> 02:00:16,041
I was wondering about that.

1409
02:00:17,586 --> 02:00:19,378
Is this your house?

1410
02:00:19,462 --> 02:00:22,548
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

1411
02:00:22,632 --> 02:00:26,343
It's nice. You got air conditioning.

1412
02:00:33,226 --> 02:00:35,269
-Thank you.
-I ate some.

1413
02:00:38,064 --> 02:00:43,485
Hey, I kept a scrapbook
of your clippings and everything.

1414
02:00:43,612 --> 02:00:45,237
There you are.

1415
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,073
And this, I got you running.

1416
02:00:51,161 --> 02:00:53,329
I ran a long way,

1417
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:55,664
for a long time.

1418
02:00:57,876 --> 02:00:59,376
And there...

1419
02:01:05,884 --> 02:01:09,345
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1420
02:01:11,848 --> 02:01:16,185
I just I want to apologize
for anything that I ever did to you,

1421
02:01:16,311 --> 02:01:21,565
'cause I was messed up
for a long time, and...

1422
02:01:24,361 --> 02:01:25,986
-Hey.
-Hi.

1423
02:01:26,196 --> 02:01:27,196
Hey, you.

1424
02:01:28,365 --> 02:01:31,325
-This is an old friend from Alabama.
-How do you do?

1425
02:01:31,409 --> 02:01:34,495
Listen, next week my schedule changes,
so I'll be able to... But thanks...

1426
02:01:34,579 --> 02:01:36,622
No problem. Got to go, Jen,
I'm double-parked.

1427
02:01:36,706 --> 02:01:38,582
-Okay. Thanks.
-Bye.

1428
02:01:42,045 --> 02:01:44,797
This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi to him?

1429
02:01:44,881 --> 02:01:47,967
-Hello, Mr. Gump.
-Hello.

1430
02:01:48,051 --> 02:01:51,053
-Can I go watch TV now?
-Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

1431
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:57,226
-You're a mama, Jenny.
-I'm a mama.

1432
02:02:00,105 --> 02:02:01,939
His name's Forrest.

1433
02:02:03,066 --> 02:02:04,400
Like me.

1434
02:02:06,027 --> 02:02:08,153
I named him after his daddy.

1435
02:02:09,114 --> 02:02:11,573
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1436
02:02:12,867 --> 02:02:14,910
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1437
02:02:29,384 --> 02:02:30,592
Hey.

1438
02:02:31,761 --> 02:02:34,638
Forrest, look at me.
Look at me, Forrest.

1439
02:02:37,225 --> 02:02:41,353
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1440
02:02:41,896 --> 02:02:43,272
Okay?

1441
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:49,486
Isn't he beautiful?

1442
02:02:50,488 --> 02:02:53,449
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1443
02:02:57,245 --> 02:02:58,328
But...

1444
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,877
Is he smart, or...

1445
02:03:04,961 --> 02:03:08,964
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1446
02:03:18,308 --> 02:03:20,768
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

1447
02:03:30,111 --> 02:03:32,946
-What are you watching?
-Bert and Ernie.

1448
02:03:56,054 --> 02:03:57,846
Forrest,

1449
02:03:59,307 --> 02:04:00,849
I'm sick.

1450
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:07,147
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1451
02:04:07,232 --> 02:04:09,608
I have some kind of virus,

1452
02:04:09,692 --> 02:04:12,402
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1453
02:04:12,529 --> 02:04:15,531
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1454
02:04:19,911 --> 02:04:22,204
You could come home with me.

1455
02:04:23,873 --> 02:04:29,545
Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1456
02:04:33,883 --> 02:04:36,677
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1457
02:04:39,055 --> 02:04:41,348
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1458
02:04:46,604 --> 02:04:47,855
Okay.

1459
02:04:48,898 --> 02:04:50,566
Please take your seats.

1460
02:04:54,404 --> 02:04:56,738
Forrest? It's time to start.

1461
02:05:16,134 --> 02:05:17,718
Hi.

1462
02:05:18,595 --> 02:05:20,095
Your tie.

1463
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:51,585
Lieutenant Dan.

1464
02:05:52,420 --> 02:05:54,087
Hello, Forrest.

1465
02:05:54,756 --> 02:05:57,424
You got new legs. New legs!

1466
02:05:58,635 --> 02:06:02,429
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1467
02:06:03,139 --> 02:06:07,142
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1468
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:12,481
Magic legs.

1469
02:06:14,484 --> 02:06:18,862
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1470
02:06:21,658 --> 02:06:25,035
-Lieutenant Dan.
-Hi, Forrest.

1471
02:06:27,121 --> 02:06:30,332
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1472
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:33,710
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

1473
02:06:43,846 --> 02:06:48,016
Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1474
02:06:49,894 --> 02:06:54,147
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1475
02:06:55,483 --> 02:06:58,860
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1476
02:07:29,726 --> 02:07:31,601
-Hey.
-Hey.

1477
02:07:45,283 --> 02:07:47,075
Hey, Forrest.

1478
02:07:52,415 --> 02:07:54,207
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1479
02:07:55,877 --> 02:07:58,211
Yes. Well, l...

1480
02:07:59,547 --> 02:08:01,256
I don't know.

1481
02:08:01,966 --> 02:08:06,928
Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.

1482
02:08:10,058 --> 02:08:12,100
And then it was nice.

1483
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:19,441
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1484
02:08:20,735 --> 02:08:24,613
There was always
a million sparkles on the water.

1485
02:08:26,407 --> 02:08:30,327
Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,

1486
02:08:30,453 --> 02:08:35,040
it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.

1487
02:08:37,585 --> 02:08:40,629
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1488
02:08:43,091 --> 02:08:47,260
I couldn't tell where heaven stopped

1489
02:08:47,804 --> 02:08:50,180
and the earth began.

1490
02:08:51,432 --> 02:08:53,308
It was so beautiful.

1491
02:08:58,022 --> 02:09:01,108
I wish I could've been there with you.

1492
02:09:04,195 --> 02:09:05,612
You were.

1493
02:09:16,332 --> 02:09:17,791
I love you.

1494
02:09:22,171 --> 02:09:25,507
You died on a Saturday morning.

1495
02:09:27,218 --> 02:09:30,971
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1496
02:09:35,852 --> 02:09:40,689
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1497
02:09:44,819 --> 02:09:46,486
Mama

1498
02:09:47,572 --> 02:09:52,576
always said that dying was a part of life.

1499
02:09:55,997 --> 02:09:58,331
I sure wish it wasn't.

1500
02:10:01,002 --> 02:10:04,754
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1501
02:10:06,090 --> 02:10:07,174
But...

1502
02:10:07,425 --> 02:10:10,093
About to start school again soon,

1503
02:10:11,929 --> 02:10:15,724
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1504
02:10:17,894 --> 02:10:23,899
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1505
02:10:27,028 --> 02:10:29,613
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1506
02:10:30,907 --> 02:10:31,948
Okay.

1507
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:33,366
He's really good.

1508
02:10:33,451 --> 02:10:35,577
Forrest, you go.

1509
02:10:39,790 --> 02:10:41,374
We fish a lot.

1510
02:10:44,921 --> 02:10:48,381
And every night, we read a book.
He's so smart, Jenny.

1511
02:10:51,636 --> 02:10:53,887
You'd be so proud of him.

1512
02:10:55,598 --> 02:10:57,057
I am.

1513
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:01,311
He wrote you a letter.

1514
02:11:02,897 --> 02:11:04,940
And he says I can't read it.

1515
02:11:05,066 --> 02:11:08,610
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1516
02:11:24,669 --> 02:11:26,002
Jenny,

1517
02:11:31,801 --> 02:11:35,011
I don't know if Mama was right,

1518
02:11:36,347 --> 02:11:37,847
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1519
02:11:37,974 --> 02:11:40,559
I don't know

1520
02:11:40,643 --> 02:11:45,146
if we each have a destiny,

1521
02:11:47,191 --> 02:11:52,320
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1522
02:11:56,826 --> 02:11:58,660
But I think

1523
02:12:00,538 --> 02:12:02,330
maybe it's both.

1524
02:12:06,669 --> 02:12:09,546
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1525
02:12:15,678 --> 02:12:17,679
But I miss you, Jenny.

1526
02:12:24,061 --> 02:12:28,481
lf there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1527
02:13:03,768 --> 02:13:06,728
Here's your bus. Okay.

1528
02:13:08,397 --> 02:13:11,733
Hey. I know this.

1529
02:13:11,859 --> 02:13:14,736
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1530
02:13:14,862 --> 02:13:17,530
Grandma used to read it to you.

1531
02:13:17,615 --> 02:13:19,741
My favorite book.

1532
02:13:23,079 --> 02:13:24,579
Here we are.

1533
02:13:24,747 --> 02:13:26,206
Okay.

1534
02:13:27,917 --> 02:13:29,417
Here you go.

1535
02:13:34,298 --> 02:13:36,800
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1536
02:13:40,262 --> 02:13:43,973
-I wanted to tell you, I love you.
-I love you, too, Daddy.

1537
02:13:45,976 --> 02:13:48,770
I'll be right here when you get back.

1538
02:13:53,317 --> 02:13:56,569
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1539
02:13:56,654 --> 02:14:00,198
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
