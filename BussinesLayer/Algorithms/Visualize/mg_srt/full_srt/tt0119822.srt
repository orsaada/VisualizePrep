1
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,820
I'm going to get some flowers, dear. I'll be back in 20 minutes.

2
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,700
It's tulip season today, and I'm so happy.

3
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,300
- Son of bitch.
- Go on, sweetie.

4
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,780
Come on, sweetie.

5
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,220
Yes, come on now, sweetheart. Come on, sweetie. Come on.

6
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:03,350
Go for a little ride, then you can whiz all over the city. Come on.

7
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,690
Come on. Go for a ride. Come on, sweetie.

8
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,400
No! Freeze! Freeze! Leg down, leg down.

9
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,400
That's it. Come on now. Come on.

10
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,920
No, you monkey-eared son of a bitch!

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,720
You have pissed your last floor.

12
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,370
Bet you wish you were a real dog.

13
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,730
Oh, you dog-eared monkey.

14
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,970
This is New York.

15
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,270
If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere...

16
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,450
you ugly, smelly...

17
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:50,650


18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,930
- Verdell!
- Uh-oh.

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,930
Verdell?

20
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,220
Where's my good doggie? Verdell?

21
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,040
Come here, sweetheart.

22
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,700
- Mr. Udall?
- Mm-hmm?

23
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,140
Have you seen Verdell?

24
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,270
What does he look like?

25
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,250
Uh, my dog. You know, my...

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,990
My dog with the little, adorable face.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
Don't you know what my dog looks like?

28
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,130
Oh, I got it. You were talking about your dog.

29
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,140
I thought it was the name of that colored man I see in the hall.

30
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,310
Which color was that?

31
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,210
Uh, like thick molasses...

32
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,980
- with a broad nose...
- Frank!

33
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,750
perfect for smelling trouble and prison food.

34
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,950
Frank!

35
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,960
- Simon, you've got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs, Melvin Udall.

36
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,450
How are you doin'?

37
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,430
Frank shows my work, Mr. Udall.

38
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,390
- I think... yeah, I think you know that.
- People are gonna start coming.

39
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,870
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me...

40
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,980
I don't give a rat crap what or where you shove your show.

41
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,810
Are we done being neighbors for now?

42
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,450
- Let me talk to you...
- No! Not worth it.

43
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,250
Definitely not worth it. Verdell must be in the apartment.

44
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,760
Okay.

45
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,030
Hope you find him. Love that dog.

46
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,430
You don't love anything, Mr. Udall.

47
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,950
One, two, three, four, five.

48
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,170
One, two, three, four, five.

49
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,070
One, two, three, four, five.

50
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,400
Okay.

51
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,100
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

52
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,930
- Hi, Carl.
- Frank, where is he?

53
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,180
- Isn't he here? He lives here.
- Take it easy.

54
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,070
- He had a little thing with the dog.
- It's not such a hot-looking dog.

55
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,130
He's adorable.

56
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,600
Who buys more than me? He isn't the only one working.

57
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,180
Good Lord. Where have you been?

58
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,110
Oh, look at my boy. Look at him.

59
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,360
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- I know you did. We know you did.

60
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,400
Where was my little baby?

61
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,930
In the basement garbage bin eating diaper shit.

62
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,670
- Go ahead, John. You earned your fun.
- Sorry. It just struck me.

63
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,680
- It's funny.
- Oh, wait.

64
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,580
How did he get down in the basement...

65
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,980
even if he got in the elevator?

66
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,400
Maybe some nice neighbor shoved him down the garbage chute?

67
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,700
Somewhere in the dark...

68
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,760
she had confessed, and he had forgiven.

69
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,750
"This is what you live for," he said.

70
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,520
"Two heads on a pillow, where all is approval...

71
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,850
"and there is only the safety...

72
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,240
"of being with each other."

73
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,530
How, she wondered, could she find such hope...

74
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,710
in the most shameful part of her?

75
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,400
- Mr. Udall!
- At last she was able to define love.

76
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,170
Love was...

77
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,740
Mr. Udall, I'd like to speak to you, please.

78
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,730
Let me do this by myself.

79
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,980
- Love was...
- Are you in there?

80
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,870
Son of a bitch!

81
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,520
Pansy-ass stool pusher!

82
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,760
Yes?

83
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,190
Maybe this can wait.

84
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,790
I... I found Verdell, Mr. Udall

85
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,270
Well, that's a load off.

86
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,540
Uh-huh. Did you do something to him?

87
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,660
Do you realize that I work at home?

88
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,560
No, I wasn't aware.

89
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,780
Do you like to be interrupted when you're nancing around in your garden?

90
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,900
No. I actually...

91
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,890
will turn the ringer off on my phone and put cardboard...

92
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,300
Well, I work all the time...

93
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,210
so never, never interrupt me, okay?

94
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,120
Not if there's a fire.

95
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,270
Not even if you hear the sound of a thud from my home...

96
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,790
and one week later there's a smell coming from there...

97
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,280
that can only be a decaying human body...

98
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,720
and you have to hold a hanky to your face...

99
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,980
because the stench is so thick you think you're gonna faint.

100
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,530
Even then, don't come knocking.

101
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,450
Or if it's election night...

102
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,430
and you're excited and you want to celebrate...

103
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,910
because some fudge packer you date...

104
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,070
has been elected the first queer president of the United States...

105
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,730
and he's going to have you...

106
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,670
down to Camp David...

107
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,060
and you want someone to share the moment with.

108
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,460
Even then...

109
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,380
don't knock...

110
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,550
not on this door...

111
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,870
not for any reason.

112
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,880
Do you get me, sweetheart?

113
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,090
Yes.

114
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,120
It's not a subtle point that you're making.

115
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,200
Okay then.

116
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,980
So the theory of confrontations says: "Think twice before messing with me."

117
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,190
All right.

118
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,790
Love was...

119
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,200
What was love?

120
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,630
Love was...

121
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,000
Now I am pissed. Now I am really pissed!

122
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,980
Don't touch! Don't touch! Don't touch!

123
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,150
Shut up! You think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude.

124
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,410
You don't intimidate me. I grew up in hell, homeboy.

125
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,790
My grandmother had more attitude.

126
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,690
Police! Donut-munching morons.

127
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,930
Help me! Help me!

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,800
Shut up! Shh...

129
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,270
Assault and battery, and you're black!

130
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,930
I like Simon enough to batter you unrecognizable...

131
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,810
if you verbally abuse him or touch that dog again.

132
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,750
Meantime...

133
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,490
I'm gonna think of some way that you can make it up to him.

134
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,320
I hate doing this!

135
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,420
I'm an art dealer.

136
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,500
Have a nice day. Okay, party!

137
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,620
- Excuse me.
- Whoa. Don't touch.

138
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,360
Get a life.

139
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,530
- Watch it.
- Don't touch.

140
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,460
- Look at you. You're all better.
- It's that new medication.

141
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,270
You know all my son's stuff, right? No, no. I got a date tonight.

142
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,900
I'm walking out and he says, "Mom, I promise not to get...

143
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,240
one of my fevers or coughs during your date."

144
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,370
- Isn't that sweet?
- A little blond angel.

145
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,020
It came out of me: "You love me the way you love your remote control.

146
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,790
"As long as I switch every time you press one of my buttons."

147
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,790
That's terrific.

148
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,090
People that talk in metaphors oughta shampoo my crotch.

149
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,260
- Eat up.
- Stay there. I've got your money.

150
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,460
- No, pay me next week.
- No, I owe you.

151
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,470
I told you today. That's the rule.

152
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,530
- Excuse me, Melvin.
- Don't...

153
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,970
- There you go. You take care.
- Thank you.

154
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,280
Pardon me.

155
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,010
Take the money. Debts make me crazy.

156
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,420
This way you take a cab home so you can get ready for the date.

157
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,290
Ready is not my problem.

158
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,350
I'm starving.

159
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,660
Fine. Go on. Sit down. You know you're not allowed back here.

160
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,120
Spence is more excited than I am.

161
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,940
He says, "I promise not to get a fever or cough during your date."

162
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,530
Sometimes this kid, you just want to...

163
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,210
I've got Jews at my table.

164
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,910
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave.

165
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,360
This once you can sit at someone else's station.

166
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,480
Or you can wait your turn.

167
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,020
- You have feelings for her?
- Well, yes.

168
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,900
How much more you got to eat?

169
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,070
Appetites aren't as big as your noses, huh?

170
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,340
- What?
- That's it. Forget it.

171
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,570
- Let me talk to him.
- I don't care how many books he sells.

172
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,170
- Give him one more chance. Here I go.
- Barred for life.

173
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,890
- They left.
- Yeah. What do you know?

174
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,900
Bryan says he doesn't care how long you've been coming.

175
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,800
You ever act like this again, you're barred for life.

176
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,980
I'm gonna miss the excitement, but I'll handle it.

177
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,740
Three eggs over easy...

178
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,060
two sausage, six strips of bacon with fries.

179
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,280
Fries today.

180
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,950
A short stack, coffee with cream and sweetener.

181
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,360
You're gonna die soon with that diet. You know that.

182
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,850
We're all gonna die soon. I will, you will.

183
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,050
It sure sounds like your son will.

184
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,210
If you ever mention my son again...

185
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,390
you will never be able to eat here again, understand?

186
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,400
Give me some sign you understand, or leave now.

187
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,280
Do you understand me, you crazy fuck?

188
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,570
Do you?

189
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,410
Yeah, yeah... yes.

190
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,260
- Yeah?
- Yes.

191
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,620
I'll get your order.

192
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,800
Wear my earrings tonight.

193
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,070
It's just so interesting what you said at dinner.

194
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,210
You said it like it was nothing.

195
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,450
Where's the bedroom?

196
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:57,220
Uh, uh, bedroom? Yeah, this is sort of it. I sort of... I sort of sleep in here.

197
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,700
Don't worry about it.

198
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,050
What?

199
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,700
I don't know.

200
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,270
Grandma. Grandma.

201
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,680
Maybe you'd better check.

202
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,480
What did you think I was gonna do?

203
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,120
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Mama!

204
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,120
I was hearing everything that you were doing...

205
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,520
so I put these on to give you privacy.

206
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,090
- So how was dinner?
- Hey, pal.

207
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,130
- How's your friend?
- Are you okay?

208
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,460
- Not bad.
- You got a temperature?

209
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,300
Scootch over.

210
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,800
- Where did your friend take you to eat?
- A nice place.

211
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,840
Carol, I have him.

212
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,410
- One more spit?
- I said I have him. He's waiting.

213
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,380
- Go.
- She has me.

214
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,550
- Okay, pal. Give me a hug.
- Carol.

215
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,080
- Give me a big hug.
- Carol, I have him.

216
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,990
I'm okay, Mom. She has me. Go.

217
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,740
Close the curtains.

218
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,880
No! You can't smoke! He can't take smoke!

219
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,750
- Magic.
- Oh.

220
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,780
Oh, God. Well, that'll teach you.

221
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,760
I don't even notice it anymore.

222
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,600
All right. Come here.

223
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,180
You don't have to get that embarrassed. It's a little bit of throw up.

224
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,370
Little bit of throw up.

225
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,660
Well, what shall we do?

226
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,680
Want me to write which trains you take to get home, or you wanna lay down...

227
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,590
No, no. I'll take a cab.

228
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,430
It's just a little too much reality for a Friday night.

229
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,510
I just can't. I promised Simon I'd find him a model.

230
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,360
<i>Carl, take me off the speaker. Did I tell you these are house seats?</i>

231
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,110
<i>Come on, you could use a break.</i>

232
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,310
<i>Hello. Carl?</i>

233
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,620
<i>You there?</i>

234
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,820
Okay. I just found a model.

235
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,600
- Hey, boys!
- I know this guy. He bought me dinner.

236
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,670
Carl, right?

237
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,690
Hey, what's going on?

238
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,770
- Remember?
- I only need one.

239
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,640
You picked me up maybe a few weeks, I don't know, some time ago.

240
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,240
This is for a portrait. I need a pretty face.

241
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,880
Portrait?

242
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,600
Come here. I'll give you the address. It's for tomorrow morning.

243
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,520
Brad Pitt. It's the shit.

244
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,220
- I don't get it.
- Do you read?

245
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,670
Who is it, baby?

246
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,860
Who is that, Verdell? Who is it?

247
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,270
I... I'm sorry. I told you today.

248
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,910
I was in the studio doing work, and I just...

249
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,610
It's out here.

250
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,990
- Sure have great things.
- Gershwin is great, isn't he?

251
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,390
I usually make a big deal about picking models...

252
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,420
but Carl is so thorough.

253
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,330
I bet he drove you nuts checking your resume, huh?

254
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,530
This is not a nude.

255
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,370
Just kidding around.

256
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,440
So much for love.

257
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,710
Yet another pose.

258
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,750
Exactly what is your previous experience?

259
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,050
How about that, hmm? I'm running out of ideas here.

260
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,420
Then give me some direction, OK?

261
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,090
Uh, nothing.

262
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,660
I just... I just watch until something strikes me.

263
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,120
I mean, do... do anything that you think of.

264
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,460
Wait for me to say "hold that pose", then try to comfortably hold it.

265
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,310
No direction.

266
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,580
Okay.

267
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,910
Wh-what I do is watch.

268
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,060
You ever watch somebody who doesn't know you're watching them?

269
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,190
An old woman sitting on a bus...

270
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,320
or kids going to school...

271
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,430
or somebody just waiting.

272
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,490
And you see this flash come over them...

273
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:43,380
and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external...

274
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,800
because that hasn't changed.

275
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,740
And when you see it, they're sort of realer...

276
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,160
and they're more alive.

277
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,510
If you look at somebody long enough, you discover their humanity.

278
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,910
Wow.

279
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,180
I know exactly what you mean.

280
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,990
Oh, my God. Hold it.

281
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,660
- Hey, look out!
- Excuse me.

282
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,720
- Sorry.
- <i>I got on the third line of dialogue.</i>

283
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,280
All of sudden, I blanked. I had no clue as to what the next line was.

284
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,850
- Ignores me.
- He said to me, "Last chance."

285
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,660
- Last chance.
- Oh, God.

286
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,180
So I came back in again.

287
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,320
Here she comes to ignore me again.

288
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,150
- I messed up on the exact same line. I know.
- En.

289
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,520
- Guess what.
- What?

290
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,030
He cast me!

291
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,380
Just what the world needs... another actress.

292
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,890
Okay, okay, okay.

293
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,980
Can't live without me, huh?

294
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,210
I'm finally gonna ask.

295
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,280
All right. What's with the plastic picnic ware?

296
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,720
Why don't you try ours? You're afraid it isn't clean?

297
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,060
- You okay?
- I see the help. It's a judgment call.

298
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,700
So give yourself a little pep talk.

299
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,160
Must try other people's clean silverware...

300
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,790
as part of fun of dining out.

301
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,430
What's wrong with your son?

302
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,910
Yeah. What do you care?

303
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,480
He's got to fight to breathe. His asthma can shoot off the charts.

304
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,150
He's allergic to dust.

305
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,890
This is New York, so his immune system bails on him whenever there's trouble.

306
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,520
So an ear infection... Is this bothering you?

307
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,220
No.

308
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,570
An ear infection, whatever, sends us to the emergency room six times a month...

309
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,640
where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor.

310
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,360
Nice chatting with you.

311
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,580
- His name?
- Spencer.

312
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,640
Okay.

313
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,850
Spence.

314
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,290
It's okay. Go on. Come on.

315
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,170
You can put on anything you want now. I might be sort of done here.

316
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,660
Hey, I've been coming here for two weeks, all we've done is work. Let's play!

317
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,620
Vincent!

318
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,600
So you're practically finished, huh?

319
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,570
Yeah. There is one more stage.

320
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,800
Where you going?

321
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,510
No place. I was just gonna sneak a peek.

322
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,320
- No, he's not allowed.

323
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,800
Wait.

324
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,500
I gotta take off. You want to say good-bye or anything?

325
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,060
- Yeah. He's just gotta go. One second.
- No, wait.

326
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,580
I'm gonna look at the painting.

327
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,880
Where are you going, sweetheart? Verdell!

328
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,880
You want some water? What is the matter with you? Come on!

329
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,050
You want some water?

330
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,050
Simon, wait!

331
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,240
Why are you doing this?

332
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,910
Oh, no, no. No. No, wait, wait, wait.

333
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,680
See.

334
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,810
- That painting in there...
- What, are you cruising him?

335
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,920
Excuse me.

336
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,680
- Help me!
- We gotta go.

337
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,800
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on!

338
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,850
OK, so you call 9-1-1 and don't leave your name?

339
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,510
Yes. Tha-that's right. Yes.

340
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,220
Even a dumb geezer should know Emergency automatically...

341
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,420
- No one got killed.
- Oh, is he dead?

342
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,590
Ask him.

343
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
What's wrong with you?

344
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,360
Don't bark at me. I didn't name ya.

345
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,800
We will. If we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.

346
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,900
What, you're trying to intimidate me with that attitude?

347
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,770
I come from hell. My grandmother's got more attitude than you.

348
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,240
Go shake down a 7-Eleven for a day-old wiener.

349
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,910
It's just a matter of time, sir. There's a painting of one of the guys.

350
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,220
Get some tape on it.

351
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,720
I've been praying for him since I heard.

352
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,020
So, anyway, I'm on my way to the hospital.

353
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,760
If you could just watch the dog tonight.

354
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,760
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- No?

355
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,680
- I'm sorry. No.
- Okay. Thanks.

356
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,270
Old bitch.

357
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,970
Damn dog.

358
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,280
You're taking him. Yes, you are!

359
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,880
Get the hell out of the way!

360
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,280
You're taking him. This will even the books. One night.

361
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,280
Wait, wait.

362
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,980
Do you want to say no to me?

363
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,680
Do you want to say no to me?!

364
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,620
Huh?

365
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,360
I don't want to say nothing to you.

366
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,360
Because I've never felt as crazy as I do right now.

367
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,000
I almost want you to say no.

368
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,680
Thanks for looking after him.

369
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,680
Hey! Where are you going?

370
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,980
- You can't do this.
- You don't wanna mess with me today!

371
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,850
I can't take a dog. Nobody's ever been in here before.

372
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,460
Hey, Frank.

373
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,160


374
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,660
You're dead.

375
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,820
We don't have no dog food here. We don't want no dog food here.

376
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,180
You'll eat what we got, what we eat.

377
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,560
All right.

378
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,660
Don't do anything.

379
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,760
Where's the trust?

380
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,420
Never a break.

381
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,620
Dogs.

382
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,880


383
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:55,120


384
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,990
God.

385
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,630
We're not going to sell anything if they find out we're halfway through a show...

386
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,660
and we haven't sold a single painting.

387
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,060
We can't reduce the price at this stage.

388
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,630
What... I'm in a free fall here.

389
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,280
- Yes?
- We can see him.

390
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,280
Okay. I'll meet you in there.

391
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,140
I will meet you in there.

392
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,960
Okay? One minute.

393
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,120
Thank you. No, I'm here.

394
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,390
How are you doing, great one?

395
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,650
I haven't looked at myself yet.

396
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,230
I figured I could tell from your reaction.

397
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,030
Oh, God.

398
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,630
That bad, huh?

399
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,560
Okay, I talked to the doctor, and... Oh!

400
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,060
Okay. It's... it's not that bad.

401
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,800
I told you the doctors say you're gonna be your old self in a couple of weeks.

402
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,880
The scars might take...

403
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,440
Oh, shit!

404
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,250
- Jackie.
- Yes?

405
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,480
Can you hand me a mirror, please?

406
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,970
Wait. I have a smaller one.

407
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,600
So how are things anyway?

408
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,150
How's Verdell?

409
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,880
Your neighbor, Mr. Udall.

410
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,980
Taking care of him.

411
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,430
How... how could you do that?

412
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,120
- No, Simon.
- He'll hurt him.

413
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,980
No. I promise. Not a chance.

414
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,100
I own this guy. Besides, there was nobody else.

415
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,040
I'm always on the move.

416
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,240
Trust me.

417
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,110
You are very certain my dog is okay, because you have no idea...

418
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,680
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.

419
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,480
Okay.

420
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,760
Waiting gives the devil time.

421
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,180
Oh, my.

422
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,560
Where did I go?

423
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,750
- Look how friendly he is.
- That's your dog?

424
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,550
No. No, no.

425
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,980
What are you doing with a dog?

426
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,730
Suckered in, set up, pushed around.

427
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,600
You're not worried someone might take it?

428
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,170
No, not until now, for Christ's sake.

429
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,980
- Sorry.
- I'm gonna sit here.

430
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,850
Hey, puppy.

431
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
He's cute.

432
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,190
I love his little face. It's so cute.

433
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,720
I wonder what breed he is.

434
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,120
He's a little dog.

435
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,980
Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.

436
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,400
How old are you?

437
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,860
If I guessed by your eyes, I'd say you were 50.

438
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,170
If I went by your eyes, I'd say you were kind.

439
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,150
So... so much for eyes. ***** How old are you?

440
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,840
You brought it up.

441
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,610
- No, I'm curious.
- Not that you're ugly.

442
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,180
Yeah. Easy, easy pal. I can take the compliment.

443
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,820
But my knees knock when you turn on the charm full blast.

444
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,620
But I mean, what's with the dark?

445
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,330
Dawn patrol.

446
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,420
Major dawn patrol. My son had a full-blown attack.

447
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,740
This time, for extra fun, they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

448
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,580
- So I get him home...
- No! No, no, no, no, no!

449
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:22,360
The dog. The bacon's for the dog.

450
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,960
Last week I was playing the piano for him, and he likes it.

451
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,230
So I decided I'm gonna...

452
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,400
make a little joke.

453
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,800
So you're all set here.

454
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,170
Yeah.

455
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,670
I think it's a beautiful day for our walk today.

456
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,980
Very nice.

457
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:03,560
Look at that. Look at him.

458
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,430
I gotta give you something.

459
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,930
I gotta give you something real good too.

460
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,960
I'm gonna show it to you. Come on, buddy.

461
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:17,270
Don't be like me. Don't you be like me.

462
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,340
You stay just the way you are, because you are a perfect man...

463
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,450
and I'm gonna take you home and get you something to eat.

464
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,480
- What you love. Hear me?
- I'd like to be treated like that.

465
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:31,820
I'm gonna take you home right now and get you something. Yes.

466
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,980
Let's go home and do some writing.

467
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,450
He had made the girl happy...

468
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,060
and what a girl.

469
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,000
"You saved my life," she said.

470
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,880
"You'd better make it up to me."

471
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,580
Done.

472
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,560
Done!

473
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,980
Yes, I hate the doggie. Yes, I hate the doggie.

474
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,660
Ooh, 62 books.

475
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,680
Done!

476
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,280
We have to cut back expenses every place we can.

477
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,800
- He has no medical insurance?
- No.

478
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:13,060
These are the food receipts here, the household expenses.

479
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,370
Here's one for the dog again.

480
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,600
- I can read it. I got it.
- There you go.

481
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,870
- All the laundry and cleaners.
- Okay, good.

482
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,680
Boy, look at that, huh?

483
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,370
Oh, he likes it at Chez Melvin, hmm?

484
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,880
What are you coming over here for? I told you to sit here.

485
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,450
I can't cook with a dog near me. Okay, just sit. Good.

486
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,480
We don't want any company. I'll read you some Ralph Waldo Emerson.

487
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,490
Okay, have it your way.

488
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,330
How's Verdell doing?

489
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,600
You know, he's a pain in the ass.

490
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,000
Well.

491
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,770
Simon's home.

492
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,650
I was hoping you can keep the dog until he's had a chance...

493
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,380
to think and adjust.

494
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,520
Oh, it's been weeks and weeks. A few more won't matter.

495
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,980
No, no, he definitely wants him back right away.

496
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,060
He'll be by tomorrow.

497
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,660
Okay.

498
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,670
Okay by me.

499
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,180
Hungry. I'll be right with you, pooch.

500
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,860
One, two, three, four, five.

501
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,360
One, two, three, four....

502
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,490
I'm okay.

503
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,910
Mr. Udall.

504
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,550
Some face they left hanging on you. You look like...

505
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,780
Could you take it...

506
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,620
just...

507
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,060
a little easy, Mr. Udall?

508
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,800
Thank you.

509
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,680
Verdell.

510
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,540
Come here, my beautiful boy.

511
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,800
Come here. Come here, boy.

512
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,600
Let's go home and get well.

513
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,380
You can't blame him for being weird.

514
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,180
Have a look at yourself in the mirror.

515
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,530
Thank you.

516
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,200
Come on, sweetheart.

517
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,100
Verdell?

518
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,100
Come here. Come here, boy.

519
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,240
I know what you want.

520
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,950
Come on. Where's my boy?

521
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,130
No, no. Don't... don't force him.

522
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,560
Over a dog.

523
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,160
Over an ugly dog.

524
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:51,070
Worst sidewalk in New York.

525
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,080
Look where they put it.

526
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,270


527
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,980
Help!

528
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,190
If you want to see me, you will make an appointment.

529
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,180
Dr. Green, how can you diagnose someone as an obsessive-compulsive disorder...

530
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,200
and then act as though I had some choice about barging in?

531
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,630
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.

532
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,360
You said you could help me. What was that, a tease?

533
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,610
I can help you if you take responsibility...

534
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,800
- to keep regular appointments.
- You changed the room around.

535
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,080
Two years ago. I also regrew my beard.

536
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,770
But you're not interested in changes in me.

537
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:33,840
I don't have this mountain of time. I have to get to my restaurant.

538
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,960
Do you know how hard it was for me to come here?

539
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,680
- Yes.
- Thank you.

540
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,660
No, we're not doing this now.

541
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:46,060
I changed just one pattern, as you always said I should.

542
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,600
No, nope.

543
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,800
What if this is as good as it gets?

544
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,220
What the heck are those for?

545
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,790
No, no, no. Get Carol.

546
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,660
I'm filling in.

547
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,530
We don't know if she's coming back.

548
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,010
You know, I think she might be getting a job closer to home.

549
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,910
- Why plastic?
- Wh... what are you trying to do to me?

550
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,360
What the heck do you mean?

551
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,340
Look, elephant girl...

552
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,410
just go get Carol or something.

553
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,460
Just have her do my one meal here.

554
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,490
You know, I'll pay whatever you want. I'll wait.

555
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,000
Do it!

556
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,330
- Bryan, code blue.
- What happened?

557
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:09,140
Out! Just shut up and get out!

558
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,440
Do it!

559
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,950
I'll be quiet.

560
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,390
Just let me stay here.

561
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,080
No problem. Go get Carol.

562
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,420
Get her here.

563
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,200
I'm not a prick. You are. I'm not judging.

564
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,560
I'm a great customer.

565
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,590
This day...

566
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,440
has been a disaster.

567
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,910
- I'm not sure if I can handle this too.
- Get out.

568
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,280
Get out immediately...

569
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,600
or there's gonna be trouble.

570
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,050
Man, I mean it.

571
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,290
Okay.

572
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,170
See ya. Good-bye.

573
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,030
It's about time!

574
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,060
Carol's last name.

575
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,800
- Connelly.
- Thank you.

576
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,700
Hey, Dad, I'm over here!

577
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:23,550
- Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not anymore.

578
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,020
What can you do?

579
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,490
Can I get some ice cream, Grandpa?

580
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,360
Why not? You're a good girl.

581
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,600
Hello.

582
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,110
Christ.

583
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:16,500
I'm hungry.

584
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,860
You've ruined my whole day. I haven't eaten.

585
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,980
What are you doing here?

586
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:26,070
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter...

587
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:29,090
Are you totally gone? This is my private home.

588
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,920
I'm trying to keep emotion out of this...

589
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:37,480
even though it's an important issue to me...

590
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,920
and I have very strong feelings on the subject.

591
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,560
What subject?

592
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,400
That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs?

593
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,630
Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?

594
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:57,580
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

595
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,240
And to prove it...

596
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,800
I have not gotten personal, and you have.

597
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:06,750
Why aren't you at work?

598
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,860
You sick?

599
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,330
You don't look sick.

600
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,040
Just tired and bitter.

601
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,730
My son is sick, okay?

602
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,440
What about your mother?

603
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,240
How do you know about my mother?

604
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,560
I hear you talking while I wait.

605
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,620
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- I'm sorry, honey. One second.

606
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,630
How're you doing?

607
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,080
You should answer someone when they speak to you.

608
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:03,880
I'm sorry, Melvin, that's it. I cannot handle you teaching my son manners!

609
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,690
Back to life.

610
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,100
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

611
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,570
<i>Five one-thousand, four one-thousand...</i>

612
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,480
three one-thousand, two one-thousand...

613
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,560
bingo.

614
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:33,800
- 104.9.
- Let's treat ourselves to a cab ride.

615
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,880
Look out, you guys. Coming through.

616
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,370
Look out. Look out.

617
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,610
- Mom!
- We're okay. We're okay.

618
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,190
Melvin, wait!

619
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:53,620
Melvin, wait!

620
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,170
Shut up, kids!

621
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:03,860
Give us a lift, would you, Melvin?

622
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,610
A lift. Okay.

623
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,660
Cover your mouth when you cough, kid.

624
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,310
Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital, and quickly, please. Could you please?

625
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,190
Okay.

626
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,220
- Hospital?
- Yes.

627
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,380
- Could you be back at work today?
- No!

628
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:26,320
Stay away from me! God!

629
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,270
Simon, we can't put this off any longer.

630
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,830
I feel terrible that I have to...

631
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,180
- Simon.
- Huh?

632
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,110
Simon, could you just leave the dog for a second?

633
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,040
Sorry.

634
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,850
- What are those cards?
- Frank's idea.

635
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,890
He thought I should have notes so I did this right...

636
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:58,460
maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.

637
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:04,080
See? He's right. I need the cards.

638
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:11,660
Simon, you're broke.

639
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,150
The medical bills are $61,000 now...

640
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,150
and the show didn't go well.

641
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,180
I've spoken to your parents.

642
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,250
They didn't hang up or anything...

643
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:27,800
but they said they would feel strange about calling you.

644
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,860
Well, I can't call them.

645
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,160
Come here, baby.

646
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,660
Come here, baby.

647
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:39,370
Verdell. What's wrong?

648
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:44,930
You miss the tough guy? Well, here I am, sweetheart!

649
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,370
Happy to see me, you little pissant mop?

650
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:49,110
How about another ride down the chute?

651
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,780
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I did not mean that. I'm sorry.

652
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,650
- Simon.
- I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

653
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,680
- Simon.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

654
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:01,890
I'll be able to keep my apartment and the studio...

655
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,890
won't I?

656
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:08,260
Wow.

657
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:11,930
Oh, my God. Wow.

658
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:44,530
Yes, you write more than everybody else and make us a lot of money.

659
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,540
- But I think it's more appropriate...
- Look.

660
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,840
I need this. Just say, "Melvin, I'll try."

661
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,600
Okay?

662
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,440
- Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you. That's good. That's good.

663
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,680
On a pleasanter note, my son just got accepted to Brown.

664
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,280
My husband was dying.

665
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,820
Uh, yeah, yeah. Good, nice, thrilled, exciting.

666
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Uh, you... ou don't have to wait with me.

667
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,180
I can't resist.

668
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:23,840
You usually move through here so quickly.

669
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,360
I have so many questions I want to ask you.

670
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,870
You have no idea what your work means to me.

671
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:32,680
What does it mean to you?

672
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:39,460
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be in here.

673
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,820
Oh, God. This is like a nightmare.

674
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,790
Oh, Come on. Just a couple of questions. How hard is that?

675
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,200
How do you write women so well?

676
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:54,860
I think of a man...

677
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,540
and I take away reason and accountability.

678
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:17,430
- Where's my newspaper?
- It's right here, Mrs. Garrett.

679
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,220
"M.D."

680
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,600
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

681
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,040
- Mom!
- In here, Mrs. Connelly.

682
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,670
What? Please, just tell me.

683
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,120
- I'm Martin Bettes. Dr. Bettes.
- Not your name!

684
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:44,750
- Don't tell me your name! Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

685
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,520
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

686
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:50,490
- Did you know docs come to your house?
- No, I didn't.

687
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,160
- I'm home!
- So what are you doing here?

688
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,160
- I didn't know you had a secret admirer.
- What?

689
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:59,660
- Oh, you met the gift.
- He's good.

690
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,400
- I'm an expert on doctors.
- Okay, Doctor.

691
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,180
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.

692
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:12,040
She said I was to take excellent care of this little guy...

693
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,960
because you are urgently needed back at work. That's what she told me.

694
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,010
What kind of work do you do?

695
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,820
- I'm a waitress.
- In Manhattan.

696
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,220
Dr. Bettes?

697
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:26,300
Uh, yeah, Terry. Excuse me.

698
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,530
I'm sorry it took so long. I don't know Brooklyn.

699
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:33,120
I couldn't find it either. Could you get this to the lab?

700
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,540
Tell them I need CBC, differential, platelets, the whole thing.

701
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:38,260
- And I want it back today.
- Okay.

702
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:41,680
I'm sorry. Did you say you're gonna get the results back today?

703
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,600
Sure. Let's sit down.

704
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,220
These are the receipts from all the prescriptions...

705
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,680
from the beginning of the year.

706
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:56,180
- The calendar.
- And this is a calendar of days...

707
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,950
and how he felt and what he's been eating.

708
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:02,660
That's very good. How long has he had the problem?

709
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:05,460
- Since forever. Six months old.
- Mm-mm, okay.

710
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,160
- Have they done blood tests on him?
- Yeah.

711
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,200
Only in the emergency room or when he was well?

712
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,300
- Emergency room only.
- How about skin testing for allergies?

713
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:18,010
- No.
- No standard scratch test?

714
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:23,210
No. I asked. They said my plan didn't cover it and it wasn't necessary.

715
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,300
- Why? Should they have?
- Well...

716
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,360
- Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!
- Carol!

717
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,950
- I'm sorry.
- Actually, that's their technical name.

718
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,600
So, once the tests come back...

719
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,610
is there someone in your office we should talk to to get the results?

720
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:46,600
Um, me. My home number's on the card.

721
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,600
That's his home number.

722
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:59,160
- What?
- It's your home number!

723
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:08,130
Can we get you anything else? Do you want some water or some coffee?

724
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,290
- No, thank you.
- A couple of female slaves?

725
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,130
Mrs. Connelly, there's still a lot of tests I need to do,

726
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,230
a lot of things I have to find out here.

727
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:22,180
But look, whatever I find out, I promise you, at the very least...

728
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:25,860
from now on your son is going to feel a great deal better, okay?

729
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,200
Doc!

730
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,830
No. Oh, fine. Okay.

731
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,860
Okay. That's good. That's good.

732
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,360
So, listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs.

733
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,680
One way or another, we'll...

734
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,880
Well, the costs are gonna be considerable, I'm afraid.

735
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:03,810
But don't worry. Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

736
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,600
That's wonderful!

737
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,830
Anyway, dear. Thank you for everything, Nora.

738
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:22,000
Forgive my recent crankiness. I'll call when things get back on track. Okay?

739
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,180
Huh? What's wrong?

740
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:36,090
- Who's gonna walk Verdell?
- Oh, no!

741
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,400
No!

742
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:57,160
- Is he dead yet?
- No.

743
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,320
Would there be any way that you would be willing to...

744
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,760
walk his dog for him?

745
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:07,480
Absolutely.

746
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:10,620
You're a wonderful man.

747
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,060
2:00 would be a good time, and here is the key...

748
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:20,150
in case he is asleep.

749
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,330
Open his curtains for him...

750
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,360
so he can see God's beautiful work.

751
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:31,260
And he'll know that even things like this happen for the best.

752
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:36,740
Did they teach you to talk like this in some "Sailor, wanna hump-hump" bar?

753
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:39,780
Or is this getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey?

754
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:43,800
Sell crazy someplace else. We're all stocked up here.

755
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:58,690
No, no. No! A seriously goofy man is behind this. You're not allowed to block that out.

756
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,030
Do you really want to go back to Emergency...

757
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:04,170
where those runt doctors keep telling us that they can't help?

758
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,410
- This lets a crazy man into our lives.
- Let's not fight.

759
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,450
You know how this will turn out. Come on!

760
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,680
You know how this will turn out.

761
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,320
This is not like stockings. It's not like a string of pearls.

762
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,880
You don't send this one back.

763
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,390
Right?

764
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,200
<i>No, I do. I understand.</i>

765
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:38,300
<i>Listen, I gotta go, okay?</i>

766
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:43,050


767
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:46,970
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

768
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,290
What a day. Come here. Come here.

769
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,890
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

770
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,160
Thank you for walking him.

771
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,360
If you'll excuse me, I'm not feeling so well.

772
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,800
This place smells like shit.

773
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:08,880
Go away.

774
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,880
- This cleaning lady doesn't...
- Please, just leave!

775
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,960
What happened to your queer party friends?

776
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,450
Get outta here!

777
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,950
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you.

778
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:34,680
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.

779
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,180
Rot in hell, Melvin.

780
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,070
No need to stop being a lady.

781
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,570
Quit worrying.

782
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:47,840
You'll be back on your knees in no time.

783
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,080
Is this fun for you?

784
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:03,550
You lucky devil. It just keeps getting better and better, doesn't it?

785
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,090
I'm losing my apartment, Melvin.

786
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:12,330
And Frank wants me to beg my parents, who haven't called me, for help.

787
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,060
And I won't. And...

788
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,180
I... I don't want to paint anymore.

789
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:21,100
So the life that I was trying for is over.

790
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,610
The life that I had is gone...

791
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:27,050
and I'm feeling so damn sorry for myself that it's difficult to breathe.

792
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,550
It's high times for you, isn't it, Melvin?

793
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:34,350
The gay neighbor is terrified.

794
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,520
Terrified!

795
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:50,970
I was just trying to give you a boost.

796
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:53,310
Lucky you.

797
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,960
You're here for rock bottom...

798
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,280
you absolute horror of a human being.

799
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:18,860
The one thing I'll do for you... I might cheer you up.

800
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,400
Get out.

801
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,260
You wanna know why the dog prefers me?

802
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,900
It's not affection. It's a trick.

803
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,940
I keep bacon in my pocket.

804
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:35,990
See?

805
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,180
Oh, my gosh.

806
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:46,260
We'll both call him. You'll see.

807
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:47,300
It's a trick.

808
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,570
Come here, Verdell.

809
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:06,210
Come on.

810
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:11,960
Come here, baby. It's okay.

811
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,730
Just stupid. A stupid dog.

812
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,920
Could you leave now?

813
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:26,490
Please?

814
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:29,570
I don't get it.

815
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:26,490
Taxi!

816
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,660
<i>Watch again with Nick At Nite's Classic TVRewind.</i>

817
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:04,460
<i>On repeat viewing, one begins to suspect...</i>

818
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:08,100
<i>that might not really be Major Healy in the phone booth after all.</i>

819
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:10,280
Mr. Udall?

820
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,840
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

821
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,160
The doctors gave me your address. I'm sorry about the hour.

822
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,360
If you're, uh...

823
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:45,180
If you're worried about thanking me...

824
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,960
That's not why I'm here.

825
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:52,480
Though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation...

826
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:54,480
with a doctor about Spencer.

827
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:59,660
Note. Put it in a note.

828
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:12,800
I have a hair dryer...

829
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:14,900
Why did you do this for me?

830
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:21,660
So you'd come back to work and wait on me.

831
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,800
Do you have some idea how strange that sounds?

832
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,480
Well, I mean...

833
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm worried you did this be...

834
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:48,600
Are you waiting for me to say something?

835
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:54,740
Look.

836
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,980
I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.

837
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:03,960
I don't think this can wait. I need to clear this up now.

838
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,780
Clear what up?

839
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:11,420
I'm not going to sleep with you.

840
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,400
I will never sleep with you! Never, ever!

841
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:16,760
Not ever!

842
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,810
I'm sorry, but...

843
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:32,450
we don't open for the "no sex" oaths until 9:00 a.m.

844
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:35,780
I'm not kidding.

845
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,920
Anything else?

846
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:43,520
Just...

847
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:47,600
thank you.

848
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,960
So you'll be at work tomorrow?

849
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:00,210
Yes.

850
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:18,980
"Never," she says. "Never," she says.

851
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,020
I took a chance you were up.

852
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:44,390
I brought you some Chinese soup.

853
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,550
Thanks.

854
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,360
I've never been this tired in my life.

855
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:18,620
I haven't been sleeping.

856
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:23,080
I haven't been clear in my head...

857
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,980
or felt like myself.

858
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:30,680
I'm in trouble.

859
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,560
It's not just the tiredness.

860
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:39,310
- Boy.
- Sick. Nauseous.

861
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,560
Sleepy.

862
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:43,540
Where everything looks distorted...

863
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:45,710
and everything inside you...

864
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:50,080
kind of aches and you can barely find the will to complain.

865
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,920
Yeah. Yeah.

866
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:57,130
I'm glad we did this.

867
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,020
Good talking to you.

868
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:13,140
You are not still writing that thank-you note.

869
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:16,060
I'm on the last page. How do you spell "conscience"?

870
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:20,910
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

871
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:24,880
Look, I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so we could go out.

872
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,960
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone.

873
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:31,350
- Could you spell it again, please?
- Spencer's okay.

874
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:35,800
You better start finding something else to do with your free time.

875
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:39,460
- Sean, are you hungry?
- Yes.

876
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:42,060
All right. We got pizza.

877
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:45,070
Carol and I are going out. Sausage and pepperoni.

878
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,510
You want to make this later for you and Spencer?

879
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:52,110
We are going out, like people do.

880
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:57,980
If you can't feel good about this break...

881
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,560
and step out a little...

882
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:04,350
then I think you ought to have Mr. Udall...

883
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,760
send you over a psychiatrist.

884
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:09,100
I don't need one, because I know what's really going on here!

885
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:15,000
I gotta finish this letter or I'll go nuts.

886
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:17,870
This can't be right. "Con-science?"

887
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,230
Carol!

888
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,840
What?

889
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,400
It's very weird now not feeling that...

890
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:50,660
stupid panic thing inside me all the time.

891
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:55,600
Without that, I just start thinking about myself.

892
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,680
And what good does that ever get anybody?

893
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,500
Today on the bus there was this adorable couple...

894
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,250
and I felt myself...

895
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,100
giving them a dirty look.

896
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:19,180
I just had no idea everything was...

897
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:28,980
Go ahead.

898
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,650
Moving in the wrong direction.

899
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,850
Away from a time...

900
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,880
when I remembered what it was like to have a man to anything.

901
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,720
Hold fucking...

902
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,960
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

903
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,800
Hands with, for Christ's sake!

904
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:58,230
I felt almost really bad...

905
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:00,360
that Dr. Bettes is married.

906
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:08,050
Which is probably why I make Spencer hug me more than he wants to.

907
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:13,120
Poor kid doesn't have enough problems.

908
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:16,130
He has to make up for his mom not getting any.

909
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:22,460
Who needs these thoughts?

910
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,260
So what are you saying? That you're frustrated?

911
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:29,000
Leave me be! Why are you doing this?

912
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:31,130
What is it you want?

913
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,800
I hope getting me to think about everything that's wrong...

914
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,850
when all I want to do is not do that...

915
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:37,880
has some purpose.

916
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:44,100
Really, Mom, what is it you want? What?

917
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,290
I want us to go out.

918
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:55,700
Okay.

919
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,780
Thank you.

920
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:21,050
Now I gotta send you a thank-you note.

921
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:25,960
Oh, look. Evelyn's here and her giant, Joey.

922
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,880
That's really why you brought me here?

923
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,360
Well, you know, it's not even mine.

924
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,640
And this guy Simon seems to have enough on his mind.

925
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:41,800
But the dog did throw up twice last night and his spark is off.

926
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,880
- Well, take him to the vet.
- I did.

927
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,080
They say his stomach's out of whack and they need him for a couple of days.

928
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:49,750
Well, do it!

929
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,650
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

930
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,950
- This is for later.
- What's this?

931
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,760
- It's a note.
- A note?

932
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:05,480
Yeah, it's a thank-you note.

933
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:07,760
Thank-you note? No, no, no.

934
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,270
- You can read it later.
- No, no, thank you.

935
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:14,300
No, no thank-you note. No, no. No. NO.

936
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,210
Thank you.

937
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,610
Thank you.

938
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:25,080
She's nice.

939
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,050
- Yeah.
- Real nice, huh?

940
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:30,360
Really nice.

941
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:37,880
Shouldn't that be a good thing, telling somebody, "No thanks required"?

942
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:41,880
Sure looks like it went over too.

943
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:47,080
Look at you!

944
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:53,040
You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night.

945
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,320
- What?
- Look at you.

946
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:04,120
- You think I'm a mark.
- You helped with the dog and now this.

947
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,200
Hey, I'm as concerned about Simon as you are.

948
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:10,220
- Concerned?
- It's not just financial assistance.

949
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:13,390
He's gotta get to Baltimore to ask his parents for money tomorrow.

950
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:17,170
Well, yeah. I mean, if his parents are alive.

951
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,210
They have to help. It's the rules.

952
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,660
That's great. Let them help him.

953
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,010
Only, uh...

954
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:31,350
I got a high-maintenance selling painter coming through, so I'm out.

955
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,950
Can you drive him?

956
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:38,750
Think white and get serious.

957
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:41,760
Take my car. A convertible.

958
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:45,730
Do you drive?

959
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,960
Like the wind. But I'm not doin' it!

960
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:51,310
Gettin' loud. Gettin' loud.

961
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:55,870
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.

962
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:58,540
I want your life for one minute, where my big problem is...

963
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:01,740
somebody offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.

964
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:13,460
- Go ahead, girl.
- Okay, I'll do it.

965
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:15,360
I'll take him. I'll take him.

966
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:17,320
Yeah, get him ready, packed.

967
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,160
Tomorrow morning I'll take him. Okay? I'll take him.

968
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:22,460
- Fine. Okay.
- Okay.

969
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:27,280
I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out.

970
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:29,560
We don't enjoy one another that much.

971
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:38,120
If there is a mental health foundation that raises money for people like you...

972
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,180
please be sure to let me know.

973
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:43,260
- Last-word freak.
- Bye-bye.

974
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,620
- Good luck, lady.
- Was he talking to me?

975
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:50,360
- So anything else?
- Yeah.

976
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,460
I'm gonna give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.

977
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,980
What I did for you, it's working out?

978
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,480
What you did changed my life.

979
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:13,900
No!

980
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:17,950
No thank-you note.

981
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:21,330
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life...

982
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,370
which you won't read...

983
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:27,060
is that somehow you have done more...

984
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:29,370
for my mother, my son...

985
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,880
and me than anybody else ever has.

986
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:36,070
I'm just gonna read you this part of it.

987
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:41,040
"And that makes you the most important, surprising...

988
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,310
"generous person I ever met in my life...

989
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:46,190
"and that you're gonna be in our prayers...

990
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:48,190
"our daily prayers forever."

991
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:50,760
Lovely.

992
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:56,030
I also wrote one part I'm just gonna say.

993
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,570
I wrote, "I'm sorry."

994
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:04,700
I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you for...

995
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,230
when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back.

996
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:11,180
So I wrote that I was sorry about that and that I...

997
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:14,600
I was sorry for busting you on that and busting in on you that night...

998
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,110
when I said I was never...

999
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:23,150
I was sorry, and I'm sorry for every time your food was cold...

1000
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:26,160
and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...

1001
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,190
and I'm sorry for never spotting right there at the table in the restaurant...

1002
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:33,080
the human being that had it in him to do this thing for us.

1003
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:37,180
You know what? I'm just gonna start from the beginning.

1004
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:38,860
"I have not been able...

1005
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:42,140
"to express my gratefulness to you.

1006
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:44,180
Even as I look at the word 'grateful' now...

1007
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:46,200
"it doesn't begin to tell you what I feel."

1008
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:55,420
That's nice of you. Thank you.

1009
01:18:58,190 --> 01:18:59,080
Thank you.

1010
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,730
Now I want you to do something for me.

1011
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:22,550
I'm sorry. Didn't I say, "What?"

1012
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,400
I thought I said "What?"

1013
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:29,600
What?

1014
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:32,160
I want you to go on this trip.

1015
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,120
No, sir.

1016
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,460
I can't do this without you.

1017
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:40,100
I'm afraid he might pull the stiff "one eye" on me.

1018
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:42,240
I need you to chaperone.

1019
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:44,670
Separate everything but cars.

1020
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:47,460
You said you like convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.

1021
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,000
I'm sorry. The stiff "one eye"?

1022
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,120
- Two days.
- I can't. I work.

1023
01:19:52,150 --> 01:19:54,350
- You get off when you want to.
- My son.

1024
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,480
Bettes said he's doin' fine.

1025
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,610
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- What's that got to do with it?

1026
01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:04,890
- I thought it was a strong point.
- Write a note, ain't she sweet.

1027
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:07,360
I need a hand, and where did she go?

1028
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:10,300
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me?

1029
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:14,060
Is there any other way to see it?

1030
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,000
No.

1031
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:26,610
Here's a little suitcase...

1032
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:29,550
shocked that it's being used.

1033
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,090
There's no way to pack for this trip.

1034
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,960
- You're still comin', aren't you?
- <i>Yes.</i>

1035
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:13,320
Melvin, I would like to know exactly where we are going.

1036
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:19,770
Just south of Baltimore, Maryland, and I know what you're gonna say next.

1037
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,100
<i>I mean, I think I know it.</i>

1038
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,440
I'm not sure...

1039
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:27,200
<i>but I think so.</i>

1040
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,510
There's no need for me to bring anything dressy?

1041
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:33,400
<i>I mean, I didn't know...</i>

1042
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:36,620
if we were eating in any restaurants that have dress codes.

1043
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:41,620
Well, I don't...

1044
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:43,780
<i>I mean, maybe.</i>

1045
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:46,230
I mean, yes! Let's.

1046
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:47,430
Let's.

1047
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,190
Okay. Gotcha.

1048
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:56,330
- What did you think I was gonna ask?
- Whether crabs were in season now.

1049
01:21:57,010 --> 01:22:00,360
Oh, okay, then. Good night.

1050
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:07,680
Anything unusual in the dog's diet?

1051
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:09,680
No.

1052
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:12,880
- Everybody gets their own cage?
- Certainly.

1053
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:16,290
Put him in with that one, not that one. Builds his confidence.

1054
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:18,990
Lip kiss.

1055
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:25,030
I love you. I'll miss you.

1056
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,800
Hey! Real sensitive!

1057
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:33,240
- Bye.
- Call me when you get settled.

1058
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:43,080
Don't worry, Mom! Have a good time!

1059
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:46,280
- Don't run.
- Have fun! Don't worry!

1060
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:50,120
- Don't run. Have fun, but don't run.
- Grandma will take care of me! Bye!

1061
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,530
- I'm sorry I'm not taking you myself.
- So am I, Frank.

1062
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,540
Give me a hug.

1063
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:05,270
- Everything's gonna be okay, all right?
- Yeah.

1064
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:06,830
Soak it up.

1065
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:11,170
It's your last chance for a hug for a few days.

1066
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:17,600
Hello.

1067
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:22,800
Hi.

1068
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,060
Thank you for being on time.

1069
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,400
Hi.

1070
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,100
Carol the waitress. Simon the fag.

1071
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:42,710
Hello. Holy God! Who did that to you?

1072
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:46,960
Um, I was...I was attacked.

1073
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:50,310
I walked in on some men robbing me...

1074
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:53,560
and I... I... I was hospitalized.

1075
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:58,120
- I almost died.
- Let's do the small talk in the car.

1076
01:23:58,700 --> 01:23:59,630
Let's go.

1077
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,460
How are you, sir? Oh, I was gonna do that for you.

1078
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,070
It's all right. Where should we sit?

1079
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:10,530
I, uh... Well, there's no place cards or anything.

1080
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:14,480
You look like you need more room, so I'll sit in the back.

1081
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:33,360
Never a break. Never.

1082
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:36,400
Thank you for the seat. That was very thoughtful.

1083
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:40,200
- You look like you're crowded in there.
- It's all right.

1084
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:45,430
Thanks.

1085
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:55,320
Thank you.

1086
01:24:57,790 --> 01:24:58,720
You're welcome.

1087
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,960
I've got the whole trip programmed.

1088
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:14,400
I'm just kidding. I wanted to see what you'd do.

1089
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:18,670
Seriously.

1090
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:20,140


1091
01:25:18,710 --> 01:25:20,440
We got good stuff here.

1092
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:36,890


1093
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,720
- I like this music.

1094
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,920


1095
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,030
I like this music.

1096
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:47,230


1097
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,540


1098
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:52,410


1099
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:58,970


1100
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:03,350
Yes, I'm sure, Simon, they did something really off for you to feel this way...

1101
01:26:03,390 --> 01:26:06,720
but when it comes to your parents or your kid...

1102
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:10,780
something will always be off for you unless you set it straight.

1103
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:15,990
And maybe this thing happened to you just to give you a chance to do that.

1104
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:19,100
Nonsense. And you want to know why?

1105
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:22,200
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say, raise their hand.

1106
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:33,620
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?

1107
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:35,450
Yes.

1108
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,860
- When I was a kid...
- No, wait.

1109
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:41,090
I'm gonna pull over, give you my full attention.

1110
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:50,930
Well, I always painted, and my mother always encouraged it.

1111
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I mean, she was really sort of fabulous about it, actually.

1112
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:57,200
And she used to...

1113
01:26:58,470 --> 01:27:01,460
You know, I was too young to think that there was anything wrong with it.

1114
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:07,250
She was... she was very natural, so she used to pose nude for me.

1115
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:11,580
And I always thought, or I guess...

1116
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:13,780
I assumed that my father knew about it.

1117
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,680
This stuff is pointless.

1118
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:19,660
- Hey, let him finish...
- You like sad stories? Wanna hear mine?

1119
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:20,560
Stop.

1120
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:27,470
Go ahead, really. Please don't let him stop you.

1121
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:34,970
One day he walked in and found us, and he started screaming.

1122
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,840
My father didn't come out of his room for 11 years.

1123
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:40,910
He used to hit me on the hands with a yardstick if I made a mistake...

1124
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:42,680
playing the piano.

1125
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:48,680
Go ahead, Simon.

1126
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,360
So you said he came in your room and he was yelling?

1127
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,260
- Uh-huh.
- Please, come on.

1128
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:59,920
- He was, um...
- Come on.

1129
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,800
Yeah, I know. I was...

1130
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:04,900
I remember I was defending my mother...

1131
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,970
and I... I was trying to, you know...

1132
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:11,380
make peace in the lamest way.

1133
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:12,880
I said...

1134
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:16,660
"She's not naked. It's art."

1135
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,320
And he started hitting me...

1136
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,980
and he beat me unconscious.

1137
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:29,890
And he talked to me less and less after that.

1138
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:33,090
I mean, he knew what I was before I did.

1139
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,800
And the morning that I left for college...

1140
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:38,300
he walked into my room...

1141
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,400
and he held out his hand...

1142
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,680
and it was filled with money.

1143
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:50,180
A big, sweaty wad of money.

1144
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:56,060
And he said, "I don't want you to ever come back."

1145
01:28:57,660 --> 01:29:01,720
And I just grabbed him and I hugged him...

1146
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,460
and he turned and walked out.

1147
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,800
We all have these terrible stories to get over, and you...

1148
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:21,000
That's not true.

1149
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:24,550
Some of us have great stories, pretty stories...

1150
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:26,710
that take place at lakes...

1151
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:30,730
with boats and friends and noodle salad.

1152
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:32,860
Just no one in this car.

1153
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,460
But a lot of people...

1154
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:38,580
that's their story: Good times, noodle salad.

1155
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:42,000
What makes it so hard is not that you had it bad, but...

1156
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:46,000
that you're that pissed that so many others had it good.

1157
01:29:46,210 --> 01:29:50,610
- No! I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

1158
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:53,680
Not it at all, huh?

1159
01:29:57,590 --> 01:30:00,250
Let's go to the hotel.

1160
01:30:01,290 --> 01:30:04,020
Tomorrow you'll see if you can get another big wad...

1161
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:06,290
of sweaty money out of his hand.

1162
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:17,710
Can I ask you a personal question?

1163
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,100
Sure.

1164
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,410
You ever get an erection over a woman?

1165
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:33,450
I mean, wouldn't your life be easier if you weren't...

1166
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:35,660
You consider your life easy?

1167
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:40,530
All right. I give you that one.

1168
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:45,660
Nice packin'.

1169
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:57,710
- Hey, Spence.
- <i>Hi, Mom.</i>

1170
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:01,180
- <i>Wait till you hear.</i>
- Why are you out of breath?

1171
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:03,660
<i>Mom, I ran over a guy and scored a goal.</i>

1172
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:08,350
- You did?
- <i>Yeah. He was big. Charlie. You know.</i>

1173
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:10,890
Th-that's great!

1174
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,930
- <i>Yep. Amazing.</i>
- Oh, my God, right?

1175
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,730
<i>Mom, we're playing again. Gotta go. Bye.</i>

1176
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,820
Wait. Just tell me...

1177
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:24,080
- <i>He scored a goal.</i>
- Mom, I... I don't believe it.

1178
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:27,070
- Oh, you would've died.
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>

1179
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:33,880
My son was outside playing soccer. Come on.

1180
01:31:33,950 --> 01:31:37,080
Take me out for a good time. Take me out dancing.

1181
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:38,250
Dancing?

1182
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:42,020
I... I... I can't. I'm exhausted.

1183
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:44,960
- Oh, come on. Please, come on. Come on.
- No.

1184
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:46,320
No.

1185
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,950
All right. All right.

1186
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:50,160
You're right.

1187
01:31:51,230 --> 01:31:55,800
- Are you sad or something?
- No, no, no, no. I'm nervous.

1188
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:59,600
It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.

1189
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:01,970
What a nice compliment.

1190
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:16,460
I'm happy.

1191
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:19,620
And you're my date.

1192
01:32:21,930 --> 01:32:23,360
Let's get dressed.

1193
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:35,110
- I'm gonna jump in the shower.
- Okay.

1194
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:37,080
- I'll be right with you.
- Okay.

1195
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:18,350
- All set?
- Yeah.

1196
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:24,560
- Do you sell hard-shell crabs?
- Yes.

1197
01:33:25,130 --> 01:33:27,460
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1198
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,480
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

1199
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:41,730
Thank you.

1200
01:33:43,810 --> 01:33:44,710
Good evening.

1201
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:47,960
- Hi. You have hard-shells, right?
- Stop asking everyone.

1202
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:51,250
Just him. Okay, you can answer. We worked it out.

1203
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:52,840
Yes, we do.

1204
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:55,950
Oh, and I can give you a tie and jacket.

1205
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:58,990
- What?
- They require a tie and jacket.

1206
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:00,360
But we have some available.

1207
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:16,340
No, I'm not putting that on.

1208
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:21,440
I'm also not going to let you inject me with the plague, either.

1209
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,920
It's such a nice place.

1210
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:26,790
You probably have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?

1211
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,560
Actually, I don't think so.

1212
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:41,390
Well, you just wait here.

1213
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:42,900
Excuse me.

1214
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,250
Good evening.

1215
01:34:59,190 --> 01:35:02,180
- I need a coat and tie.
- Well, come on in.

1216
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:02,980
No!

1217
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:06,280
No?

1218
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:09,480
- Uh, that one.
- This one?

1219
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:11,260
That one, yeah. And this tie.

1220
01:35:21,510 --> 01:35:22,240
Excuse me.

1221
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:31,090
She's here. We saved a table for you.

1222
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:34,080
- Thanks.
- Should I get her for you?

1223
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,120
No, that's all right. I'll just watch.

1224
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:47,630
- Can I buy you another drink?
- This is plenty. No, thank you.

1225
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:33,180
Oh. Wait.

1226
01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:05,110
You look so se...

1227
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,180
You look, uh, great.

1228
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,550
You look great.

1229
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:27,030
You want to dance?

1230
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:32,010
Well, I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.

1231
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:34,100
- And?
- No.

1232
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:38,940
I don't get this place.

1233
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:44,140
They make me buy a new outfit and let you in in a housedress.

1234
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:45,750
I don't get it.

1235
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:50,120
What? No. Wait. Why?

1236
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:53,220
Where are you goin'? Why?

1237
01:37:56,270 --> 01:38:00,030
I didn't mean it that way. I mean, you ought to sit down.

1238
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:03,360
You can still give me the dirty look. Just sit down and give it to me.

1239
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:05,100
Pay me a compliment, Melvin.

1240
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:07,880
I need one. Quick.

1241
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:12,240
You have no idea how much what you just said hurt my feelings.

1242
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:15,580
The mono-minute someone gets that they need you...

1243
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:17,960
they threaten to walk out.

1244
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:21,550
A compliment is something nice about somebody else.

1245
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:25,200
- Now or never.
- Okay.

1246
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:37,100
And mean it.

1247
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:50,610
Can we order first?

1248
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:00,690
Two hard-shell crab dinners!

1249
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,530
Pitcher of ice-cold beer!

1250
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:04,880
Baked or fries?

1251
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:05,820
Fries.

1252
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:09,420
Fries.

1253
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:11,600
One baked, one fried.

1254
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:13,800
I'll tell your waiter.

1255
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:16,340
My waiter.

1256
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:22,980
Okay, now, I got a real great compliment for you...

1257
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:24,180
and it's true.

1258
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:27,650
I'm so afraid you're about to say something awful.

1259
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:31,250
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style.

1260
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:34,700
Okay, here I go.

1261
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:37,680
Clearly a mistake.

1262
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:44,470
I've got this, what, ailment?

1263
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:52,140
My doctor, a shrink that I used to go to all the time...

1264
01:39:52,210 --> 01:39:55,080
says that in 50 or 60 percent of the cases...

1265
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:57,660
a pill really helps.

1266
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:00,080
I hate pills.

1267
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:02,250
Very dangerous thing, pills.

1268
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:07,160
"Hate", I'm using the word "hate" here about pills. "Hate"

1269
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:09,820
My compliment is, that night...

1270
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,500
when you came over and told me that you would never...

1271
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:19,000
All right, well, you were there. You know what you said.

1272
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:21,680
Well, my compliment to you is...

1273
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:27,910
the next morning I started taking the pills.

1274
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:33,880
I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.

1275
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:42,560
You make me want to be a better man.

1276
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:58,360
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.

1277
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:05,740
Well, maybe I overshot a little,

1278
01:41:05,790 --> 01:41:09,080
because I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.

1279
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,270
How's it goin' with those pills?

1280
01:41:24,710 --> 01:41:27,440
Good, I hope, I hope...

1281
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:34,880
It's little by little.

1282
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:41,650
It's... it's exhausting talking like this. Exhausting

1283
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:05,500
Do you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?

1284
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:07,310
Never.

1285
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:10,450
Here's the trouble with "never."

1286
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:36,870
- You don't owe me that.
- That wasn't payment.

1287
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:42,350
When you first came in to breakfast, when I first saw you...

1288
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:43,980
I thought you were handsome.

1289
01:42:45,890 --> 01:42:47,860
Then, of course, you spoke.

1290
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:53,080
So now that your...

1291
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:56,980
soft little underbelly is all exposed...

1292
01:42:57,980 --> 01:42:59,980
tell me, why did you bring me here?

1293
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:05,780
Why?

1294
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,340
It's...

1295
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:13,750
a personal question.

1296
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:17,380
- Tell me, even if you're scared.
- Scared?

1297
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,880
Tell me why you wanted me here.

1298
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:22,520
It's okay.

1299
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:26,120
If you ask me, I'll say yes.

1300
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:28,830
Well, I...

1301
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:33,700
I don't know.

1302
01:43:33,770 --> 01:43:35,800
There's a lot of reasons.

1303
01:43:36,570 --> 01:43:40,200
I thought... one thought... maybe if you had sex with Simon...

1304
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:41,800
- maybe...
- What?

1305
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:46,540
Well, that's just one... one idea.

1306
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:48,480
That's why you brought me?

1307
01:43:49,550 --> 01:43:51,380
Like I'm a what...

1308
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:53,660
and I owe you what?

1309
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:56,810
I don't know why I brought you. I... I...

1310
01:43:56,860 --> 01:44:01,120
That was just one thought that I had. It came out first. That's all it was.

1311
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,900
I thought, you kiss him, me.

1312
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,630
When you two seemed to hit it off...

1313
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:09,360
No, wait. That's... I didn't mean...

1314
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:11,360
Forget what I said about Simon.

1315
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:14,360
- I'll never forget you said it.
- It's a mistake.

1316
01:44:15,940 --> 01:44:17,120
It was a mistake.

1317
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:26,490
- <i>Hello, this is Fred Bishop.</i>
- <i>And Betty.</i>

1318
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:28,750
<i>We're sorry to be unable to take your call right now.</i>

1319
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:31,120
<i>Please leave a message with all the pertinent information.</i>

1320
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:32,960
- <i>Say good-bye.</i>
- <i>Good-bye.</i>

1321
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:34,090
<i>Thank you.</i>

1322
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:36,830
It's Simon.

1323
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:39,400
I'm in town.

1324
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:48,640
Folks, you haven't been out later that 10:00 in your entire lives.

1325
01:44:48,710 --> 01:44:50,010
Please pick up the phone.

1326
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:54,580
Really.

1327
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:01,850
Okay, I'll try you in the morning.

1328
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,650
I need to see you...

1329
01:45:04,390 --> 01:45:06,120
or at least get you to answer the phone.

1330
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:17,510
How are you?

1331
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:21,510
- Is this gonna be your room?
- Our room.

1332
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:24,180
I don't wanna see him, and he's not gonna knock on your door.

1333
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:25,960
What happened?

1334
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:27,880
Don't ask.

1335
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:34,490
- Can you not be so violent?
- I don't think so.

1336
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:35,490
- Do you need help...
- No!

1337
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:41,560
I'm taking a big bath and ordering a big meal.

1338
01:45:42,430 --> 01:45:43,800
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1339
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:49,440
I'm tired of my own complaints. I gotta get some new thoughts.

1340
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:50,960
Why? What are you thinking about?

1341
01:45:52,570 --> 01:45:53,980
How to die, mostly.

1342
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:59,000
Can you believe, in our little mix, you're the good roommate?

1343
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:15,260
- Good night.
- Good night.

1344
01:46:58,110 --> 01:47:00,040
Hold it.

1345
01:47:20,030 --> 01:47:22,360
- I have to draw you.
- Huh?

1346
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:26,980
I have to draw you.

1347
01:47:27,670 --> 01:47:28,500
No, no, no.

1348
01:47:28,970 --> 01:47:31,600
Absolutely not. I'm a lot more shy than people think.

1349
01:47:31,670 --> 01:47:33,700
- I give off the wrong impression.
- I have to.

1350
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,480
I haven't sketched anything in weeks.

1351
01:47:35,710 --> 01:47:38,340
Stop staring. Do a vase.

1352
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:40,840
But you're beautiful, Carol.

1353
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:43,780
Your skin, your long neck...

1354
01:47:45,150 --> 01:47:46,920
the back, the line of you.

1355
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:52,230
You're why cavemen chiseled on walls.

1356
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:58,200
All right. Cut me a break.

1357
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:23,650
<i>The next thing I know she's...</i>

1358
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:25,860
sitting right there next to me.

1359
01:48:26,930 --> 01:48:29,660
Well, it's not right to go into details.

1360
01:48:29,730 --> 01:48:30,980
I got nervous.

1361
01:48:32,230 --> 01:48:34,760
I screwed up. I said the wrong thing.

1362
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:40,670
Where if I hadn't...

1363
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:44,080
I could be in bed right now with a woman...

1364
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:48,450
who if you make her laugh, you got a life.

1365
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:53,020
Instead, I'm here with you.

1366
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:58,050
No offense, but a moron pushing the last legal drug.

1367
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:04,970
Jameson, soda back.

1368
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,980
I'm sorry. I don't care how you put this.

1369
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:12,960
- We're being naughty here, pal.
- No, no.

1370
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,070
This is great. This is so great.

1371
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:20,240
I swear to God, my hand won't even keep up.

1372
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,720
- Hold it, hold it.
- I'm just turning.

1373
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:25,410
- Then hold that. Hold any of them.
- Okay. This?

1374
01:49:25,650 --> 01:49:29,480
It doesn't matter. My hand's not even bothering me.

1375
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:32,350
I can't... I just...

1376
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:35,420
I can't get the angle with this cast.

1377
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:41,070
Oh, careful.

1378
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:50,940


1379
01:49:53,210 --> 01:49:55,910
Coming in. It's late.

1380
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:04,120
Did you have sex with her?

1381
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:07,500
Okay, so you're sure you don't want your shampoos or anything?

1382
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:13,000
Sorry.

1383
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:16,830
I didn't know she was still here.

1384
01:50:17,910 --> 01:50:20,930
- Did you have sex with her?
- To hell with sex.

1385
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:23,660
It was better than sex. We held each other.

1386
01:50:25,810 --> 01:50:28,380
What I need he gave me great.

1387
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:30,440
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

1388
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:37,560
I just love her.

1389
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:45,460
How are you doin'?

1390
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:04,840
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mom? Hi.

1391
01:51:04,890 --> 01:51:08,340
<i>Hello, Simon. You were right. We were home last night.</i>

1392
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:10,450
Do you have to whisper? I can barely hear you.

1393
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:13,260
- <i>I'm not a screamer.</i>
- No, no, no, no.

1394
01:51:13,330 --> 01:51:16,060
It was the luckiest thing you didn't answer last night.

1395
01:51:16,130 --> 01:51:18,220
- <i>Your father hasn't been feeling well.</i>
- No, I can't hear you.

1396
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:21,200
- <i>It's too late to start. Hold on.</i>
- Hold for what?

1397
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:23,570
What are you gonna do? Where are you going?

1398
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:26,570
I get why you're angry with me, but it's no snap to...

1399
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:29,560
- He's talking to his parents.
- Then you listen to me.

1400
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:32,980
Truly no grudges, okay? Truly.

1401
01:51:33,010 --> 01:51:37,250
I mean, It was odd that you didn't come see me when you heard I was hurt, but...

1402
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:40,600
- <i>We almost did.</i>
- No, I don't even want to talk about it. I...

1403
01:51:40,890 --> 01:51:43,920
The important thing is that your son is happy.

1404
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:47,050
- <i>You do sound different.</i>
- Yes, I'm working again.

1405
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:50,390
- <i>Good. About money</i>...
- No, I don't need anything.

1406
01:51:50,430 --> 01:51:53,030
I'll drop you a line from wherever I land.

1407
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:56,090
Then it's up to you to make the next move, and I hope you do.

1408
01:51:56,170 --> 01:51:58,200
He's gonna want to stay.

1409
01:51:58,270 --> 01:52:01,180
They'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever.

1410
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:05,040
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- <i>Bye, dear.</i>

1411
01:52:05,110 --> 01:52:07,110
- He's gonna feel stirred up.
- Bye, Mom.

1412
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:10,450
We'll probably have a good five-hour drive.

1413
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:13,250
- It'll give us a chance to relax...
- So?

1414
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:15,880
- And be together alone.
- I'm coming with you.

1415
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:19,820
- What about your parents?
- No, no, no, no. I'll take care of myself.

1416
01:52:19,890 --> 01:52:23,920
What are you talking about? You got real problems.

1417
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:27,420
I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

1418
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:30,660
Suddenly everything seems so easy.

1419
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:35,200
Carol, a load has been lifted.

1420
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:40,450
- One night with me.
- You think you're kidding.

1421
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:47,050
- Ah, geez. No choice.
- I got a gift for you.

1422
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:49,980
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.

1423
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:51,590
Let me see.

1424
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,860
Ah. Gorgeous.

1425
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:58,800
Do it then, and pick up the dog. I can't believe you let it stay there.

1426
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:01,060
Good-bye.

1427
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:04,570
Your luck's running.

1428
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:09,600
They sublet your place. You're homeless.

1429
01:53:11,110 --> 01:53:14,000
Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.

1430
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:18,280
- Another place where?
- Does it matter?

1431
01:53:21,990 --> 01:53:24,620
No. It doesn't.

1432
01:53:26,030 --> 01:53:28,560
I'm fine. Like the hat?

1433
01:53:30,330 --> 01:53:31,630
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1434
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:50,410


1435
01:53:55,460 --> 01:53:59,050


1436
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:04,560


1437
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:06,530
I don't want to hear that music right now.

1438
01:54:07,070 --> 01:54:09,660
- What do you mean? You said you liked it.
- I don't.

1439
01:54:12,410 --> 01:54:15,260
- This one has a meaning.
- It's your call...

1440
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:18,740
but I don't want to hear it, if that means anything.

1441
01:54:38,530 --> 01:54:40,180
Yes, sir. All right.

1442
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:44,600
Here's the... here's the keys to my apartment.

1443
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:50,160
You, you go up there and wait. I'm gonna take Carol home. Wait, wait, uh...

1444
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:53,360
- I'll take a bus.
- No, I'll... I'll take you.

1445
01:54:59,650 --> 01:55:01,880
Can you... can you come here?

1446
01:55:02,420 --> 01:55:05,660
- Look, I don't care what you did for me. I...
- What's wrong?

1447
01:55:06,630 --> 01:55:09,190
I don't think I want to know you anymore.

1448
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:11,990
All you do is make me feel bad about myself.

1449
01:55:15,470 --> 01:55:16,440
You have my number.

1450
01:55:20,010 --> 01:55:21,200
Let him take you home.

1451
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:22,910
I don't want to.

1452
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:27,340
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1453
01:55:38,230 --> 01:55:39,860
Don't say anything.

1454
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:46,830
I gotta get ahold of Frank, see where I'm hanging my hat.

1455
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:47,930
Well...

1456
01:55:49,370 --> 01:55:51,670
I think you're gonna have to camp it here.

1457
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:55,300
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, look! There's Verdell!

1458
01:55:55,340 --> 01:55:56,640
Look at you!

1459
01:55:56,680 --> 01:55:58,740
- Come here.
- Look at you.

1460
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:06,910
Mommy and Daddy are home.

1461
01:56:09,820 --> 01:56:13,320
Sorry. You're just fun to mess with.

1462
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:20,490
They rented your place furnished. Jackie said she was gonna bring your personal things.

1463
01:56:20,570 --> 01:56:24,100
They were gonna set you up in here. It's an extra room.

1464
01:56:24,170 --> 01:56:25,610
I never use it.

1465
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:28,860
It's got good light. No other choice, really.

1466
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,180
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1467
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:37,820
It's... nice.

1468
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:40,080
It looks good.

1469
01:56:41,390 --> 01:56:43,360
They got your music...

1470
01:56:44,390 --> 01:56:46,860
paintings, paints.

1471
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:49,260
Have to say they did a good job.

1472
01:56:52,530 --> 01:56:54,400
Well, it's gonna be okay, huh?

1473
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:58,000
- Cozy, huh?
- Yeah.

1474
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:05,280
Thank you, Melvin.

1475
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:08,680
You overwhelm me.

1476
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:17,250
I love you.

1477
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:25,260
I tell you, buddy.

1478
01:57:26,330 --> 01:57:29,700
I'd be the luckiest guy alive if that did it for me.

1479
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:44,080
Make yourself at home.

1480
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:48,560
<i>Anything else in the bag?</i>

1481
01:57:50,530 --> 01:57:53,720
- I played soccer while you were away.
- Yeah, I know.

1482
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:56,660
I love my cookbook.

1483
01:57:57,730 --> 01:58:01,190
It's great. It's got all these wonderful recipes in here.

1484
01:58:01,270 --> 01:58:04,710
It says something for shark. I never fixed shark before.

1485
01:58:04,770 --> 01:58:07,800
"Shark With A Bite." Would you like that, Spencer?

1486
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:11,400
There's some cookies here called "Wasps' Nest."

1487
01:58:14,650 --> 01:58:17,380
Where is my big, hairy boy?

1488
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:19,350
Where is he?

1489
01:58:20,790 --> 01:58:24,280
Where is my beautiful boy? Sweetheart.

1490
01:58:25,630 --> 01:58:27,820
Oh, you're in bed.

1491
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:29,800
Oh, no. No.

1492
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:31,560
Yeah.

1493
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:34,060
Melvin.

1494
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:38,670
I just didn't think Verdell should get too comfortable...

1495
01:58:38,710 --> 01:58:40,640
- sleeping in here.
- Look.

1496
01:58:40,710 --> 01:58:43,480
- It's not gonna...
- The dog's already comfortable.

1497
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:48,580
Is this okay?

1498
01:58:51,420 --> 01:58:52,350
Hello.

1499
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:55,250
Hi, it's me. Hi!

1500
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:56,350
Yes.

1501
01:58:57,020 --> 01:59:00,790
He took me in. Yes. It's Carol for you.

1502
01:59:00,830 --> 01:59:04,220
I practically fainted when I walked in.

1503
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:06,460
- Take the dog. Take the dog.
- I gotta go.

1504
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:10,460
- Just take the dog.
- Oh, come here.

1505
01:59:12,010 --> 01:59:13,500
Come on. Move faster.

1506
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:17,370
- Don't limp. Move fast.
- Good luck.

1507
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:34,960
- Yeah.
- <i>How are you doing?</i>

1508
01:59:35,530 --> 01:59:38,690
- Not so hot.
- <i>Why? What's wrong?</i>

1509
01:59:40,030 --> 01:59:42,880
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.

1510
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:45,500
<i>Maybe both. Maybe.</i>

1511
01:59:45,570 --> 01:59:49,670
See, right there, I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.

1512
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:52,840
- Cute.
- You don't have to answer everything I say.

1513
01:59:52,910 --> 01:59:56,280
Just listen to me, okay? Listen to me.

1514
01:59:57,850 --> 02:00:01,050
It's really something that you're looking after Simon.

1515
02:00:02,290 --> 02:00:03,860
And what I said on the street...

1516
02:00:05,430 --> 02:00:07,360
that was a bad thing to say.

1517
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:12,060
It made me sick to my stomach. It was a bad thing to say.

1518
02:00:14,700 --> 02:00:19,560
I'd be lying if I didn't say I enjoy your company.

1519
02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:24,310
But the truth is, you do bother me enormously.

1520
02:00:24,380 --> 02:00:26,870
And I know that it...

1521
02:00:26,950 --> 02:00:29,710
I think that it's better for me to not have contact with you...

1522
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:31,480
because you're not ready...

1523
02:00:31,550 --> 02:00:33,750
and you're a pretty old guy to not be ready...

1524
02:00:33,790 --> 02:00:35,980
and I'm too old to ignore that.

1525
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:39,790
But there were extraordinary kindnesses...

1526
02:00:39,830 --> 02:00:41,760
that did take place.

1527
02:00:49,770 --> 02:00:51,660
So anyway, thanks for the trip.

1528
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:54,840
Good night.

1529
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:55,960
Good night.

1530
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,360
Okay if I say something now?

1531
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:04,510
Go ahead.

1532
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:09,110
I should have danced with you.

1533
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:15,200
Good night.

1534
02:01:37,180 --> 02:01:41,090
- Are you gonna talk to me or not?
- I'm coming.

1535
02:01:52,470 --> 02:01:55,770
- What did she say?
- That I'm a great guy.

1536
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:57,480
Extraordinary.

1537
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:00,560
And she doesn't want contact with me.

1538
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:04,380
I'm dying here.

1539
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:08,480
Because...

1540
02:02:09,550 --> 02:02:10,510
you love her.

1541
02:02:11,810 --> 02:02:12,610
No.

1542
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:16,700
And you people are supposed to be sensitive and sharp?

1543
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:20,180
Then you tell me why. You're the one who's "dying here."

1544
02:02:21,030 --> 02:02:22,120
I don't know.

1545
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:24,890
- Let me sleep on it.
- Oh, come on.

1546
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,960
- I'll figure it out.
- Oh, please.

1547
02:02:30,670 --> 02:02:33,000
I... I... I... I'm stuck.

1548
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:36,180
I can't get back to my old life.

1549
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:41,180
She... she's evicted me from my life.

1550
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:43,050
Did you really like it that much?

1551
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:45,480
Well, it's better than this.

1552
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:48,750
Look, you, I'm very intelligent.

1553
02:02:48,790 --> 02:02:51,760
If you're gonna give me hope, you gotta do better than you're doing.

1554
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:55,850
If you can't be at least mildly interesting, then shut the hell up.

1555
02:02:55,930 --> 02:02:59,660
I mean, I'm drowning here, and you're describing the water!

1556
02:03:00,070 --> 02:03:01,990
Picking on me won't help.

1557
02:03:04,210 --> 02:03:06,860
If that's true, I'm really in trouble.

1558
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:12,800
Melvin, do you know where you're lucky?

1559
02:03:17,050 --> 02:03:18,980
You know who you want.

1560
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:23,350
I would take your seat any day.

1561
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:26,150
So do something about it!

1562
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:29,050
Go over there, now, tonight. Don't sleep on it.

1563
02:03:29,130 --> 02:03:32,390
It's... it's... it's not always good to let things calm down.

1564
02:03:32,770 --> 02:03:36,860
You can do this, Melvin. You can do this. You can.

1565
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:38,560
Pull the stops. Tell her how you feel.

1566
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:42,940
- You can do this.
- Hey, I'm charged here.

1567
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:46,310
- Yes, you are.
- She might kill me if I go over.

1568
02:03:46,510 --> 02:03:49,280
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story.

1569
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:51,540
Listen, I really think you have a chance here.

1570
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:55,480
The best thing you have going for you is a willingness to humiliate yourself.

1571
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:58,890
So go over there, do this. Catch her off guard.

1572
02:04:04,570 --> 02:04:06,330
- Okay.
- Okay.

1573
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:10,300
- Thanks a lot.
- Okay.

1574
02:04:13,310 --> 02:04:14,240
Here I go.

1575
02:04:25,120 --> 02:04:25,920
What's wrong?

1576
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:31,120
I forgot to lock the door.

1577
02:05:51,270 --> 02:05:52,440
What do you want, Melvin?

1578
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:56,370
- I'm sorry I woke you.
- I wasn't asleep.

1579
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:02,650
What a break.

1580
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:07,190
Is it a secret what you're doing here?

1581
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:13,090
I had to see you.

1582
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:18,560
Because?

1583
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:23,830
It relaxes me.

1584
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:30,770
I'd feel better sitting outside your apartment on the curb...

1585
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:32,260
than any other place...

1586
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:35,060
I can think of or imagine.

1587
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:38,450
No, no, no, no, wait. That's overstating.

1588
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:41,880
I'd rather be sitting inside on the steps...

1589
02:06:42,120 --> 02:06:44,280
'cause I don't want to get my feet in the gutter.

1590
02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:45,950
- What would that serve?
- Stop it!

1591
02:06:46,030 --> 02:06:49,880
Why can't I just have a normal boyfriend? Why?

1592
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:53,290
Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me.

1593
02:06:53,370 --> 02:06:57,560
Everybody wants that, dear. It doesn't exist.

1594
02:07:00,770 --> 02:07:02,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

1595
02:07:03,910 --> 02:07:05,460
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1596
02:07:12,290 --> 02:07:13,280
Boyfriend.

1597
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:22,420
Come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.

1598
02:07:23,860 --> 02:07:26,900
Maybe we could live without the wisecracks.

1599
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:32,460
Maybe we could.

1600
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:02,860
It feels a little confined in here.

1601
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:04,660
Let... let... let's take a walk.

1602
02:08:08,010 --> 02:08:09,440
See, it's 4:00 in the morning.

1603
02:08:10,510 --> 02:08:12,880
A walk sounds a little screwy to me...

1604
02:08:14,210 --> 02:08:15,770
if you don't mind.

1605
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:18,520
Well, if you need an excuse...

1606
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:24,360
there's a bakery on the corner that will be open soon.

1607
02:08:24,620 --> 02:08:26,520
That way we're not screwy.

1608
02:08:26,980 --> 02:08:30,550
Just two people that like warm rolls.

1609
02:08:34,970 --> 02:08:35,830
Okay.

1610
02:08:54,820 --> 02:08:55,720
What are you doing?

1611
02:08:57,160 --> 02:09:00,090
I still want you to hear part of that car song.

1612
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:01,090
You don't have to...

1613
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:10,500
<i>And darlin'</i>

1614
02:09:11,070 --> 02:09:13,130
<i>I'm never lonely</i>

1615
02:09:14,210 --> 02:09:17,200
<i>Whenever you're in sight</i>

1616
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:19,210
Thank you.

1617
02:09:21,580 --> 02:09:23,520
You know, I was hoping...

1618
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:43,100
I'm sorry. Whatever this is is not gonna work.

1619
02:09:52,180 --> 02:09:54,980
- I'm feel...
- What?

1620
02:09:57,020 --> 02:09:58,880
I'm feeling better, Carol.

1621
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:03,250
Melvin, Even though it may seem that way now...

1622
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:06,080
you don't know me all that well.

1623
02:10:07,660 --> 02:10:09,080
I'm not the answer for you.

1624
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:12,960
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.

1625
02:10:14,330 --> 02:10:17,570
- You know what?
- Ju-ju-ju-ju-just let me...

1626
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:19,060
Let me talk.

1627
02:10:25,580 --> 02:10:29,380
I might be the only person on the face of the Earth...

1628
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:32,460
that knows you're the greatest woman on Earth.

1629
02:10:32,590 --> 02:10:36,040
I might be the only one who appreciates...

1630
02:10:36,090 --> 02:10:40,620
how amazing you are in every single thing that you do...

1631
02:10:40,690 --> 02:10:43,400
and how you are with Spencer.

1632
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:45,030
Spence.

1633
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:50,030
In every single thought you have and how you say what you mean...

1634
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:52,570
and how you almost always mean something...

1635
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:57,500
that's all about being straight and good.

1636
02:10:59,710 --> 02:11:02,310
I think most people miss that about you.

1637
02:11:02,380 --> 02:11:04,480
And I wonder how they can watch you...

1638
02:11:04,550 --> 02:11:07,540
bring their food and clear their tables...

1639
02:11:07,590 --> 02:11:11,320
and never get that they just met the greatest woman alive.

1640
02:11:12,460 --> 02:11:13,880
And the fact that I get it...

1641
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:16,630
makes me feel good...

1642
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:19,620
about me.

1643
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:31,770
Is that something that's...

1644
02:11:32,010 --> 02:11:34,560
bad for you to be around for you?

1645
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:45,800
No.

1646
02:11:49,700 --> 02:11:51,260
I'm gonna grab ya.

1647
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:55,670
I didn't mean for that to be a question.

1648
02:11:55,740 --> 02:11:57,060
I'm gonna grab ya.

1649
02:12:21,290 --> 02:12:23,800
I know I can do better than that.

1650
02:12:47,550 --> 02:12:49,850
Better. Definitely better.

1651
02:12:55,630 --> 02:12:56,720
See?

1652
02:13:12,810 --> 02:13:15,480
Oh! What's this?

1653
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:16,250
Warm rolls.

1654
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:28,220
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

1655
02:13:39,730 --> 02:13:44,730
