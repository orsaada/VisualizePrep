That's how this blessed
miracle came to be?

154
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,801
No. No, no.
The act was premeditated.

155
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,969
I mean, the sex,

156
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,263
not the whole, like,
let's-get-pregnant thing.

157
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,183
So, when did you decide

158
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,519
that you were going
to, uh, do Bleeker?

159
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,980

around in their shorts,

Well, there's nothing
like experimenting.

00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,152
Um, I did

237
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,779
the prep questions for
this lab last night.

238

247
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,629
Yeah, I have
a menstrual migraine,

248
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,589
so I can't really look at
bright lights today.

249
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,341
Amanda,
I told you to go

250
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,592
to the infirmary and lie down.

251
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,885
You never listen.

252
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,804
No, Josh, because
I don't take orders,

253
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,223
- not from you and not from any man.
- You've been acting

254
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,474
like this ever since I got back

255
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,184
from visiting my brother in Mankato.

256
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,311
I already told you,
nothing happened.

257
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,313
Well, I'm gonna set
up the apparatus.

258
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,649
Um, Juno, do you want to
plug in the Bunsen burner?

259
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,692
- It's my pleasure.
- I'm going to the infirmary.

260
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,486
Good. Call me when
you get off the rag.

261
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,488
Fine. Call me when you
learn how to love someone

262
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,114
instead of cheat at
your brother's college

263
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,658
just because you had
four Smirnoff Ices

264
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,369
and a bottle of snow peak
peach flavored Boone's.

265
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,912
Good, Amanda,
I'll be sure to do that.

266
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,872
- I'll make a note of it.
- (scoffs)

267
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,250

heard that

268
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,126
the snow peak peach flavor

269
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,254
is the best flavor of Boone's.

What?

Can you just hold on for a second?

280
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,290
I'm on my hamburger phone.

281
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,212
Y... okay, yeah, now I can...

282
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,048
Yeah, it's just, like,
really awkward to talk on.

283
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,216
Um...

284
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,718
Yeah, yeah, I...

285
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,304
I-I need an abortion.

286
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,556
Sixteen.

287
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,766
I'm gonna say it's been about, um...

288
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,895
two months and four days
since the sex.

289
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,939

the term "sexually active."

292
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,073
What does it even mean?

293
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,575
That I, like, deactivate someday?

294
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,119
Or is this some sort of
permanent state of being?

295
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,996
I guess Bleeker went live
that night we did it, I guess,

296
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,749

that look on his face.

Should've seen this
octopus furnace at work.

This cactus-gram stings even
worse than your abandonment."

308
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,445
That's my stepmom, Bren.

309
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,405
She's completely
obsessed with dogs,

310
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,657
owns a nail salon

311
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,701
and always smells like
methyl methacrylate.

312
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,287
So, Juno, how was your
little maneuver last night?

313
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,497
Which maneuver, sir?

314
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,415
The one where I move
an entire living room set

315
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,418
from one lawn to the other
or the one where I downed

316
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,671
a 64-ounce blue Slushee
in ten minutes.

317
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,922
Juno,

318
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,132
did you by any chance
barf in my urn?

319
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,804
Mac, you know that nice urn
by the front door,

320
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:13,972
the one I got up in Stillwater?

321
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,098
Mm-hmm.

322
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,224
There was some blue shit...

323
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,308
I mean, gunk,

324
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,602
stuff in there this morning.

325
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,606
I would never barf
in your urn, Brenda.

326
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,943
I mean, maybe LB did it.

327
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,696

Hey, Su-Chin.

Oh. Hi, Juno.

338
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,757
How are you?

339
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,176
You know, pretty solid.

340
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,970
Um...

341
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,763
So, did you... did
you write that paper

342
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,432
for Worth's class yet?

343
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,559
No, not yet.

344
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,227
I tried to work on it
a little last night,

345
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,062
but I'm having trouble
concentrating.

346
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,189
Oh, well, I'll sell you some
of my Adderall, if you...

347
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,399
No, thanks.

348
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,650
I'm off pills.

349
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,735
It's a wise choice.

350
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,819
'Cause I knew this girl,

351
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,612
she had this, like,
crazy freak-out

352
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,865
'cause she took too many
behavioral meds at once.

353
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,992
And she just, like,
ripped off her clothes

354
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,536
and dove into the fountain
at Ridgedale mall,

355
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,041
and was like, "Bligh, I'm
a kraken from the sea!"

356
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,461
I heard that was you.

357
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,256
Well, it's good seeing you, Su-Chin.

358
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,970
Your baby probably has
a beating heart, you know.

359
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,930
It can feel pain.

360
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,640
And it has fingernails!

361
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,979
Fingernails? Really?

362
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:04,123
Welcome to Women Now,
where women are trusted friends.

363
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,917
Please put your hands
where I can see them

364
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,418
and surrender any bombs.

365
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,755
Hey, I'm here for the big show.

366
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,132
Your name, please?

367
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,259
Juno MacGuff.

368
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,261
She thinks
I'm using a fake name,

369
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,014
like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.

370
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,768
I need you to fill these out,
both sides,

371
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,353
and don't skip the hairy details.

372
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,605
We need to know about
every score and every sore.

373
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,110
Would you like a free condom?

374
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,653
They're boysenberry.

375
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,864
No, I'm... I'm off sex right now.

376
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,325
My boyfriend uses them
every time we have intercourse.

377
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,410
They make his junk

378
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,162
smell like pie.

379
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,705
(short laugh)

380
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,386
(fingers tapping)

381
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,976
(snapping)

382
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,186
(fingers tapping, scraping)

383
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,274
(loud scratching)

384
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,317
(loud tapping,
scratching and scraping)

385
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,903
(heart beating)

386
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,365
All babies want to get borned.

387
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,576
All babies want to...

388
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,413
God appreciates your miracle!

389
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,832
Dude, what are you doing here?

390
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,750
I'm supposed to come
get you at 4:00.

391
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,502
Couldn't do it, Leah.

392
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,588
It smelled like
a dentist's office in there.

393
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,298
And there were these
horrible magazines

394
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,507
with water stains.

395
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,842
And then the friggin'
receptionist

396
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,719
is trying to get me
to take these condoms

397
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,512
that look like grape suckers.

398
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,097
And just babbling away

399
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,557
about her friggin'
boyfriend's pie balls.

400
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,350
Ooh, yum.

401
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,311
Oh, and then Su-Chin was there.
Yeah.

402
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,147
And she was like, "Oh, hi.
Babies have fingernails."

403
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,565
Fingernails.

404
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,108
That's gruesome. Do you
think the baby could all like

405
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,651
scratch your vag
on the way out

406
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,153
and then it would...?

407
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,988
I'm staying pregnant, Leah.

408
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,908
Dude! You got to keep
your voice down, okay?

409
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,284
My mom is inside.

410
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,827
She doesn't know that
we're sexually active.

411
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,162
What does that even mean?

412
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,663
I've been thinking.

413
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,541
I was thinking I could, like,
have this baby

414
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,793
and give it to someone that,
like, totally needs it.

415
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,420
You know, like,
a woman with a bum ovary

416
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,671
or a couple nice lesbos.

417
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,049
But then you're gonna
get, like, huge.

418
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,383
And your chest is gonna milktate.

419
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,594
And you're gonna have to,
like... tell people

420
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,720
that you're pregnant.

421
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,055
Yeah, but maybe they'll,
like, canonize me

422
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,389
for being so selfless.

423
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,391
Or maybe they'll,
like, totally shit

424
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,894
and be really, really mad
and not let you graduate

425
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,187
or go to Cabo for spring break.

426
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,648
I was gonna go to Gettysburg
with Bleeker anyway.

427
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,236
You should look at adoption ads.

428
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,363
I see them all the time
in the PennySaver.

429
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,990
They have ads for parents?

430
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,367
Yeah.

431
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,910
"Desperately seeking spawn"

432
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,620
right next to, like, terriers

433
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,580
and iguanas and used fitness
equipment and stuff.

434
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,041
It's... it's, like, totally legit.

435
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,297
Mm. "Wholesome, spiritually
wealthy couple

436
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,925
have found true love
with each other." Aw.

437
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,843
All that's missing is your bastard.

438
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,303
I want a parakeet.

439
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,305
Juno, you're totally
not even listening to me.

440
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,598
No, I heard you.

441
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,850
I just, like, I don't
want to give the baby

442
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,769
to a family that describes
themselves as "wholesome."

443
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:12,937
- Why?
- Well, I don't know,

444
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,313
I just want someone
a little more edgier.

445
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,440
Okay, what did you
have in mind exactly?

446
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:20,361
I was thinking more like...
graphic designer, mid-30s,

447
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,363
you know, with a cool Asian
girlfriend who, like,

448
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,615
dresses awesome and rocks out
on the bass guitar.

449
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,575
But I don't want to be
too particular.

450
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,494
Okay.

451
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,662
Uh, how about this?

452
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,789
"Educated, successful
couple seeking

453
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,166
"infant to join our family of five.

454
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,043
"You will be compensated.

455
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,921
Help us complete
the circle of love."

456
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,298
- Yeesh.
- That sounds great.

457
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,425
They sound like a freakin' cult
is what they sound like.

458
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,718
And, besides, they
already have three kids.

459
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,594
You know, they're just like
greedy little bitches.

460
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,679
Ooh, Juno.

461
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,805
How about this one?

462
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,936
They were Mark
and Vanessa Loring,

463
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,939
and they were beautiful
even in black and white.

464
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,740
(knock on door)

465
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,743
Hey, Paul, are you coming
downstairs to eat?

466
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,120
Uh, no, I don't think so.

467
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,580
You ran eight miles today, puppy.

468
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,374
I-I'm not hungry, oddly.

469
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,834
But it's breakfast for supper.

470
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,044
It's your favorite, Paul.

471
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,296
Yeah.

472
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,049
Juno MacGuff called while
you were out running today.

473
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,052
You know how I feel about her.

474
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,638
Yeah, yeah, you mentioned it
a couple times.

475
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,016
She's just...

476
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,559
different.

477
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,644
I know.

478
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,799
So I'm not really sure
how I'm gonna spit this out.

479
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,884
Hon, did you get expelled?

480
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,803
No, the school would most
likely contact you

481
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,013
in the event of my expulsion.

482
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,223
Well, I was just asking.

483
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,391
It seemed plausible.

484
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,934
What, do you need
a large amount of money?

485
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,185
Legal counsel?

486
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,105
I'm not...
I'm not asking for anything.

487
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,815
Except for maybe mercy.

488
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,109
Like, it would be friggin' sweet
if no one hit me.

489
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,402
Well, what have you done, June bug?

490
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,778
Did you hit someone with the Previa?

491
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,154
No.

492
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,241
Dude, I think it's
best to just tell them.

493
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,249
I'm pregnant.

494
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,375
Oh, God.

495
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,918
Yeah, but I'm gonna

496
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:41,961
give it up for adoption.

497
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,171
And I already found
the perfect couple.

498
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,298
They're gonna pay for the
medical expenses and everything.

499
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,301
And-and...
what, 30, er, odd weeks,

500
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,805
we can just pretend
that this never happened.

501
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,807
You're pregnant?

502
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,059
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

503
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,978
And if it is any consolation,

504
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,106
I have heartburn that is
radiating to my kneecaps,

505
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,527
and I haven't taken
a dump since... Wednesday.

506
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,028
Morning.

507
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,780
I didn't even know
you were sexually active.

508
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,990
(sighs)

509
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,116
Who is the kid?

510
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,452
The baby? I don't really
know much about it

511
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,996
other than... I mean,
it has fingernails,

512
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,581
- allegedly.
- Nails? Really.

513
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,415
Yeah.

514
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,583
No, I don't, I mean,

515
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,251
who is the father, Juno?

516
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,629
Um...

517
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,756
It's... it's Paulie Bleeker.

518
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,467
Paulie Bleeker?

519
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,386
What?

520
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,054
I didn't think he had it in him.

521
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,973
I know, right?

522
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,224
(laughing)

523
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,517
Right. This is no laughing matter.

524
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,643
JUNO: No, it's not.

525
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,229
And you know,
Paulie is actually great

526
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,314
- in, uh...
- Okay.

527
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,440
in chair.

528
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:47,443
You're thinking about adoption?

529
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:50,321
Yeah, yeah, and it,
there's this couple

530
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:51,614
they haven't had, you know,

531
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,325
they've been trying to have
a kid for, like, five years.

532
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,659
We found them
in the PennySaver

533
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,827
next to the exotic birds.

534
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,870
And they have

535
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,997
a legitimate lawyer

536
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,999
and I was gonna go
meet with them next weekend.

537
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,209
June bug, that is

538
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,877
a tough, tough thing to do.

539
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,922
It's probably tougher than
you can understand right now.

540
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,799
Oh, I... I know.

541
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,720
And I... it's just that
I'm not ready to be a mom.

542
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,388
Damn skippy, you're not.

543
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,556
You don't even remember

544
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,016
to give Liberty Bell
her breathing meds.

545
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,520
That was once, and she
did not die, if you recall.

546
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,939
Honey, had
you considered

547
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,650
you know... the alternative?

548
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,943
No.

549
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,069
Well,

550
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,946
you're a little Viking.

551
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,364
(sighs)

552
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,615
First things first.

553
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,283
All right, we have
to get you healthy.

554
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,826
You need prenatal vitamins.

555
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,287
Incidentally, they
do incredible things

556
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,872
for your nails, so that's a plus.

557
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,208
Oh, and we need to schedule
a doctor's appointment.

558
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,502
Figure out where
you're going to deliver.

559
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,296
Juno, I'm coming with you
to meet this... adoption couple.

560
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,631
You're just a kid.

561
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,383
I don't want you
to get ripped off

562
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,801
by a couple
of baby-starved wing nuts.

563
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,427
Thanks, Dad.

564
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,513
Boy, I thought you were
the kind of girl

565
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,056
who knew when to say when.

566
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,065
I don't really know
what kind of girl I am.

567
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,911
Whoa.

568
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,371
Just tell it to me straight, Bren.

569
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,831
You think this is my fault?

570
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,917
I think kids get bored
and they have intercourse.

571
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,044
And I think June bug
was a dummy about it, Mac.

572
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,422
I am not ready to be a Pop Pop.

573
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,965
You're not gonna be a Pop Pop.

574
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,594
Somebody else is gonna find
a precious blessing from Jesus

575
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,721
in this garbage dump of a situation.

576
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,932
Did you see that coming
when she sat us down here?

577
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,685
Yeah, but I was hoping she was
expelled or into hard drugs.

578
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,271
That was my first instinct, too,
or a DWI.

579
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:50,190
Anything but this.

580
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,192
And I'm gonna punch
that Bleeker kid in the wiener

581
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,611
next time I see him.

582
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,029
Mac. Come on.

583
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,364
You know it wasn't his idea.

584
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,868
Yeah.

585
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:33,817
♪ ♪

586
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,341
(doorbell chimes)

587
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,182
Hi.

588
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,850
I'm Vanessa.
You must be Juno.

589
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,519
Mr. MacGuff, hi.

590
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,020
Vanessa Loring.

591
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,855
It's, uh, Vanessa, right? Is that...

592
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,191
Thanks for having me
and my irresponsible child

593
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,401
over to your house.

594
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,444
Oh, no, thank you.
Thank you.

595
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,530
Come on in.

596
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,865
Can I take your coat or your hat?

597
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,200
Oh, yeah, sure. Thanks.

598
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,370
Oh, wicked pic in the
PennySaver, by the way.

599
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,871
Super classy,
not like those people

600
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,373
with the fake woods
in the background.

601
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,709
Honestly, who do they
think they're fooling?

602
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,669
You found us in the PennySaver?

603
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,838
Hi. Mark Loring.
I'm the husband.

604
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:36,964
How you doing?

605
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,342
- Mac MacGuff.
- Nice to meet you. Hi.

606
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,720
This is Gerta Rauss,
our, um, attorney.

607
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,389
(exaggerated German accent):
Gerta Rauss.

608
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,934
Hi. Nice to meet you.

609
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,144
And this, of course, is Juno.

610
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,730
Like the city in Alaska.

611
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,772
No.

612
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,566
No?

613
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,943
Hon? Shall we sit down,
get to know one another?

614
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,445
Well, I thought I'd get some drinks.

615
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,571
What would anyone like?

616
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,740
I have Pellegrino
or vitamin water or...

617
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,074
orange juice with...

618
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,202
I'll have
a Maker's Mark, please. Up.

619
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,663
MAC: She's kidding.

620
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,874
June bug has a wonderful
sense of humor,

621
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,042
just one of her many genetic gifts.

622
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,461
I'll sit down.

623
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:21,425
So, Juno, first off,
how far along are you?

624
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,178
I'm a junior.

625
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,929
No, I mean, in your pregnancy.

626
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,222
Oh, right.

627
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,099
Um, well, actually my stepmom

628
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,436
took me yesterday to the doctor,
and they said I was 12 weeks.

629
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,979
VANESSA:
That's great. That's marvelous.

630
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,023
So you're into your
second trimester.

631
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,108
Uh... yeah.

632
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,276
(giggles)

633
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,153
Apparently. I'm due on May 4th.

634
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,237
Great.

635
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,447
My girlfriends tell me

636
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,824
that the first couple of
months are the hardest.

637
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,910
I didn't notice it at all, actually.

638
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,454
Uh, I'm more concerned
about when they have to put

639
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,790
that, like,
elastic band, you know,

640
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,208
in the front of my jeans.

641
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,627
I think pregnancy's beautiful.

642
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,212
Oh, you're lucky it's not you.

643
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,259
Let's talk about
how we're gonna do this thing.

644
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,761
What do you mean,
don't I just

645
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:10,140
have the thing, squeeze it
on out and hand it over?

646
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,477
Mark and Vanessa are willing
to negotiate an open adoption.

647
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,645
Uh, wait,

648
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,230
what does that mean?

649
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,273
It means they'd send
annual updates, photos,

650
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,942
let Juno know how the baby is doing.

651
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,193
as he, or she, grows up.

652
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,611
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no.

653
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:26,156
I don't want photos or
any kind of notification.

654
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,950
You know. I mean...

655
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,618
Can't we just, like,
kick this old school?

656
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,829
You know, like, I-I stick
the baby in a basket

657
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,623
send it your way, like
Moses in the reeds?

658
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:38,126
Technically, that would
be kicking it Old Testament.

659
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,628
(laughs): Exactly. Right?

660
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,129
Do you know what I mean?

661
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,715
Like in the good old days,
when it was quick and dirty.

662
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,343
Well, then... we all agree?

663
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,429
A traditional closed adoption

664
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,806
would be best for all involved.

665
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,224
Shit. Yes.

666
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,517
Just close 'er on up.

667
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,810
Obviously we

668
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,020
would compensate you
for all your medical expenses.

669
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,315
Are you looking for any other
type of compensation?

670
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,026
Excuse me?

671
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,573
What? No.

672
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,117
No, I don't want to,
you know, sell the thing.

673
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:14,454
I just... I want...

674
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,709
I just want the baby to be with
people who are gonna love it

675
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,169
and be good parents, you know?

676
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,254
Um...

677
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,132
I mean, I-I'm in high school.

678
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,427
Dude, I'm-I'm just...
I'm ill-equipped.

679
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,471
Well, you're doing a beautiful

680
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,473
and a selfless thing for us.

681
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,934
Vanessa's wanted a baby
ever since we got married.

682
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,978
I want to be a mommy so badly.

683
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,063
- (laughs)
- You don't say.

684
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,733
Have you ever felt like you
were just born to do something?

685
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,859
MAC: Yes.

686
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,777
Heating and air-conditioning.

687
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,280
There you go.

688
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,948
I was born to be a mother.

689
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,199
Some of us are.

690
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,911
How about you, Mark?
Are you, uh...

691
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,204
looking forward to being a dad?

692
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,623
Mmm. Betcha.

693
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,957
Yeah.

694
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,500
Every guy wants to be a father,

695
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,960
wants to coach the soccer team

696
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,588
and help out
with the science fair...

697
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,590
the volcano goes off...
I don't know.

698
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,426
(laughs): Yeah. All that.

699
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,345
VANESSA:
Maybe Gerta could take us through

700
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,430
the preliminary documents
that you've drawn up.

701
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,557
JUNO:
Sweet. Yeah, uh,

702
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,434
could I use the facilities first?

703
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,979
'Cause being pregnant
makes me pee like Seabiscuit.

704
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,607
Sure. The downstairs
bathroom's being retiled,

705
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,108
but if you go upstairs

706
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,443
and then to the right and to the...

707
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,528
Oh, yeah.
The room with the toilet.

708
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,656
Is she all right?

709
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,330
(laughs softly)

710
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,313
(scary growl)

711
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,912
- Oh! Dude.
- Sorry.

712
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,331
Sorry. I didn't expect
to see you up here.

713
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,582
Just came up to get something.

714
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,128
Did your wife send you up here
to spy on me?

715
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,589
No. What? Do we come off as
paranoid yuppies or something?

716
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:34,428
Well, I... I stole a squirt
of your wife's perfume.

717
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,347
- Really?
- It's Clinique Happy.

718
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,058
Get a whiff
of those sparklin' top notes.

719
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,228
Oh, yeah. That supposed
to make me feel... happy?

720
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,022
You should feel happy, homes.

721
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,982
I'm giving you and Vanessa
the gift of life—

722
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,026
sweet, screaming, pooping life—

723
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,485
and you don't
even have to be there

724
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,154
- when it comes out all covered in, um...
- Viscera.

725
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,114
blood and guts.

726
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,869
Uh... Whoa!

727
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,037
Is that a Les Paul?

728
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,372
Yes, it is.

729
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,750
Vanessa gave me my own room
for all my stuff.

730
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,878
She gave you your own room
in... in... in...

731
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,088
in your whole house for your...
for your stuff?

732
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,633
Wow. She's got you
on a long leash there, Mark.

733
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,053
Oh, it's beautiful!

734
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,222
You know, I always loved Gibson
more than Fender. Like, just...

735
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,099
What do you play?

736
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,976
Um... I rock a Harmony.

737
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,770
Oh.

738
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,230
- Is it mahogany?
- Yeah.

739
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,107
And what happens
if you crack the neck?

740
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,776
I mean, that must be,
like, a bitch to...

741
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,194
Tell me about it.
I used to play

742
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,488
in this real tight band when
I lived in Chicago, and this

743
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,864
one night we opened up
for the Melvins,

744
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,075
and I busted that thing
right onstage. It cost me $800

745
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,326
just to get it fixed.

746
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,579
Whoa. So... so when was that?
Was that, like...?

747
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,456
'93.
Best time for rock 'n' roll.

748
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,041
Nuh-uh!

749
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,085
'77! Are you...?

750
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,337
- What?!
- Punk, volume number one!

751
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,421
You're crazy.

752
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,714
You weren't there.

753
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,674
You couldn't understand the magic.

754
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,468
You weren't even alive!

755
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,263
What's that?

756
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,975
It's a Pilates machine.

757
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,105
What do you make with it?

758
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,481
You don't make anything.

759
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,149
It's for exercising.

760
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,653
Yeah, my wife ordered
one of those, uh...

761
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,447
Tony Little "Gazelles" off the TV.

762
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,658
You know, from the guy
with the ponytail?

763
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,910
Guy just doesn't look right to me.

764
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:29,417
(guitar strumming,
Mark singing in distance)

765
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,879
I'll be right back.

766
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,216

Hi.

771
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,103
You're playing music.

772
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,647
Juno wanted a little
closer look at Kimber.

773
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,066
Your guitar is named Kimber?

774
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,236
- Yeah.
- That's cool. My ax is named Roosevelt,

775
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,779
but after Franklin, not Ted.

776
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,657
Franklin— he was the hot one
with the polio?

777
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,118
Yeah. Um... hey, Gerta's downstairs.

778
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,327
We still have...

779
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,913
we still have a lot of stuff
to go over and do.

780
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,998
I got it. I got it.

781
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,332
- You got it?
- Got it.

782
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,459
Not to interrupt
the jam session, but...

783
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,339
Just look these over.

784
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,967
If you have any questions,
call me at my office.

785
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,969
We would really appreciate
if you would just, you know,

786
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,721
keep us updated
on any doctor's appointments

787
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,265
or ultrasounds
or anything of that nature,

788
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,684
- if it's not too much...
- No. Right. For sure.

789
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,353
You want to know how
your kid's a-cookin'. I get it.

790
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,898
You think you're really
going to do this, then?

791
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:37,527
Yeah. Yeah. No. I...
I like you guys. Yeah.

792
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:41,031
How sure would you say you are?

793
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:45,410
Like... Would you say
you're 80% sure,

794
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,996
or 90% sure or...?

795
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,665
I'm going to say
I'm about 104% sure.

796
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,958
Really?

797
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,126
Here you go, sir.

798
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,503
No, seriously, if I could
just have the thing,

799
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,006
and give it to you now,
I totally would.

800
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,883
But I'm guessing
it looks, probably,

801
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,551
like a sea monkey
right now,

802
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,386
and, you know, we should
let it get a...

803
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,888
get a little...
get a little cuter.

804
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,056
- Right?
- Yes.
- That's great.

805
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,182
Keep it in the oven.

806
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,808
I think that's a great idea.

807
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,893
Nice to meet you both.

808
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,728
- You, too.
- Please drive carefully.

809
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,189
- Hopefully, we'll hear from you soon.
- Thank you.

810
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,149
- VANESSA: Thank you.
- All right. You take care.

Hey, Vijay.
How's it going?

822
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,983
- Did you hear? Juno MacGuff's pregnant.
- Yeah.

823
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,277
- Like our moms and teachers.
- Yeah.

824
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,736

Yep.

What a trip, huh?

827
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,952
I don't really know
too much about it.

828
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,704
You should grow a mustache.

829
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,414
I can't.

830
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,581
Me neither.

831
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,250
But I'm going
to stop wearing underpants.

832
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,294
Raise my sperm count.

833
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,795

Me and some guys are going to
go to the movies after school,

839
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,492
and we're going
to doughnut that flick

840
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,660
with the guy who has 18 kids.

841
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,329
You want to come?

842
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:56,833
Oh, it... sounds awesome,
but I got my ultrasound.

843
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,753
Oh, really?

844
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,963
Can I, uh...

845
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,007
Should I come, you think?

846
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,469
Aw, you...
you can't waste those...

847
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,387
those doughnut holes there.

848
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,765
I... But maybe I could,
you know, drop by later.

849
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,391
- (bell ringing)
- Okay. Cool.

850
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,185
Later, Bleek.

851
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,520
See ya.

852
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,522
I'll save you a seat.

853
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,369
There's your baby.

854
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,870
- Ah!
- Oh!

855
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,413
Oh, my God!

856
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,874
There's a hand.

857
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,042
- Oh!
- Oh!

858
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,835
And an arm.

859
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,799
And there's the feet.

860
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,635
Oh!

861
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,053
Would you look at that?

862
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,015
Whoa! Check out Baby Big Head!

863
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,850
Dude, that thing is freaky looking.

864
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,144
Excuse me—
I am a sacred vessel,

865
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,647
all right? All you've got
in your stomach is Taco Bell.

866
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,192
It's amazing
that there's actually saps

867
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,527
that cry at this.

868
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,488
What? I'm not made of stone.

869
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,199
Well, there you have it.

870
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,784
Would you like to know the sex?

871
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,327
- Yes.
- No.

872
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,704
- Please, Juno. Please!
- No. Definitely no. There's no sex.

873
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,623
Planning to be surprised
when you deliver.

874
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:21,084
Well, no, I want Mark
and Vanessa to be surprised,

875
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,252
and if you told me,

876
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,753
I'll just, like, ruin everything.

877
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,672
Are Mark and Vanessa
your friends at school?

878
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,173
No, no, no.
They're the adoptive parents.

879
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,093
Oh. Well, thank goodness for that.

880
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,595
What's that supposed to mean?

881
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,182
I just see a lot of teenage
mothers come through here.

882
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,600
It's obviously
a poisonous environment

883
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,852
to raise a baby in.

884
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,354
How do you know that
I'm so poisonous, you know?

885
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,773
Like, what if
these adoptive parents

886
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,400
turn out to be, like,
evil molesters?

887
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,152
Or, like, stage parents?

888
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,611
They could be utterly negligent.

889
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,822
Maybe they'll do a far
shittier job of raising a kid

890
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:51,948
than my dumbass stepdaughter
ever would.

891
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,032
Have you considered that?

892
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,618
No. I guess not.

893
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,954
Yeah.
What is your job title exactly?

894
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,790
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.

895
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,125
Well, I'm a nail technician,

896
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,335
and I think we both ought
to stick to what we know.

897
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,963
Excuse me?

898
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,798
Oh, you think you're so special

899
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,383
'cause you get
to play picture pages up there?

900
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,468
My five-year-old
daughter

901
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,844
could do that,
and let me tell you,

902
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,762
she's not the brightest bulb
in the tanning bed.

903
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,556
So why don't you go back
to night school in Manteno

904
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,141
and learn a real trade?

905
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,315
Bren, you's a dick!

906
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,651

Juno. Wow! I didn't
expect to see you here.

917
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,218
I... I have something
really cool to show you guys.

918
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,594
Is Vanessa here?

919
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,179
Uh... nope.

920
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,973
Actually,
she's working late tonight.

921
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,391
She's trying to accrue
as much time off

922
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,017
as she can before the...

923
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,895
Oh, right. I hear these
are quite the time suck.

924
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,397
Yeah. You want to come on in?

925
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,648
I'm just having a ginseng cooler.

926
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,774
Would you like one?

927
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,568
What is it with
you rich people

928
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,944
and your herb-infused juices?

929
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,862
It's probably
got something to do

930
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,824
with those 44-packs they come in.

931
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,576
They're not bad, though.

932
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,911
Wait a second.
Why aren't you at work?

933
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,122
I work mostly from home.
I'm a composer.

934
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:07,083
No shit?

935
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,002
Like Johann Brahms or...?

936
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,962
No. More commercial stuff.

937
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,171
Like what?

938
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,464
Commercials.

939
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,216
- Oh.
- Yeah.

940
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,385
Have you seen the ads for
the Titanium Power men's deodorant?

941
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:21,264
Mmm! Uh-huh. Mmm-hmm.

942
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:24,809
(heavy metal style):
♪ Titanium Power-r-r-r ♪

943
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:28,438
♪ Get more snatch
by the baa-atch. ♪

944
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,772
Right. Paid for this kitchen.

945
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,567
Whoa!

946
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,194
You're quite the sellout, Mark.

947
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,863
I mean, what would the Melvins say?

948
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:40,408
Did you say you had
something to show me?

949
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:44,287
Behold, good sir, your future child.

950
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,789
Hey, look at that.

951
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:53,463
I think it looks
like my friend Paulie.

952
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,340
Is he also bald and amorphous?

953
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,883
No. He's the dad.

954
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,385
Oh. Wow.

955
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,596
Can you tell
if it's a boy or a girl?

956
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,139
Um... I can't.

957
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,641
The doctor can.

958
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,185
But I kind of want it
to be a surprise.

959
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,270
Well, it can only
go one of two ways.

960
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,480
That's what you think.

961
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,023
I mean,
I drink tons of booze,

962
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,817
so you might end up with one
of those scary neuter babies

963
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,944
that's born without junk.

964
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,154
Junk, huh?

965
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,281
Yeah.
You know, its parts.

966
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,991
- I know what junk is.
- Yeah, right.

967
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,160
We definitely want it
to have some junk. Please.

968
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,995
You don't need
to worry about a thing.

969
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,541
My stepmom, Bren, makes me
eat super healthy, you know?

970
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,335
I can't stand
in front of the microwave,

971
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,463
and no red M&Ms—
I hope you're ready.

972
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:38,299
Ooh. Do you hear that?

973
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,926
What?

974
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,512
This is my favorite song.

975
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:45,848
This is Sonic Youth doing
"Superstar" by the Carpenters.

976
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,684
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know the Carpenters.

977
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:51,771
Chick drummer, freaky dude
not unlike the White Stripes.

978
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,022
You haven't heard
the Carpenters like this.

979
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,108
Just listen.

980
00:44:56,235 --> 00:45:01,114
♪ Your guitar ♪

981
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:05,743
- ♪ It sounds so sweet and clear... ♪
- Yeah. Yeah, I like this.

982
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,787
What... what did you say
your favorite band was?

983
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,248
Didn't.
It's a three-way tie between

984
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:13,501
the Stooges, Patti Smith
and the Runaways.

985
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,420
I am definitely
making you some CDs,

986
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,922
at least while my kid's in there.

987
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:21,718
♪ Don't you remember you told me
you love me, baby... ♪

988
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,261
The Wizard of Gore?

989
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,221
That is Herschell Gordon Lewis.

990
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,098
- He's the ultimate master of horror.
- (sputters)

991
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:31,477
Please! Dario Argento is so
the ultimate master of horror.

992
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,897
Argento? He's... he's all right.

993
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,525
But Lewis is completely demented.

994
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,777
Okay? We're talking
about buckets of goo.

995
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,779
I mean, there's red corn syrup
all over the place.

996
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,407
There's fake brains
coming out the yin-yang.

997
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,785
Quite frankly,
this looks a little stupid.

998
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,664
Give me the tape.

999
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:57,378
- (eerie music playing)
- (screaming)

1000
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:05,553
Ugh... (laughing)

1001
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,764
This is even better than Suspiria.

1002
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,890
What'd I tell you?

1003
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,224
Kudos.

1004
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,894
You have decent taste
in slasher movies.

1005
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,396
Here's to dovetailing interests.

1006
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,568
Have you guys thought
of any names for the baby yet?

1007
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,904
Uh, sort of, yes.

1008
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,573
Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.

1009
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,827
Madison?

1010
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,788
Wait, hold on.

1011
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:36,250
Isn't that, like, a little... gay?

1012
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,545
Wow, pretentious much?

1013
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,715
Should everyone just have
a mysterious name like Juno?

1014
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,886
No... you see, my dad went
through this huge obsession

1015
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,846
with Roman and Greek mythology.

1016
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,391
- So he decided to name me after Zeus' wife.
- I got it.

1017
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,143
Zeus, like, he had
tons of lays,

1018
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,813
but I'm pretty sure Juno
was his only wife.

1019
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:01,192
And she was supposed to be, like,
really beautiful, but really mean.

1020
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,402
Like Diana Ross.

1021
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,822
That suits you.

1022
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,199
Thanks?

1023
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,495
You are something else.

1024
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,497
Ah...

1025
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,915
(garage door opening
in distance)

1026
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:20,127
There's Vanessa.
You'd better go.

1027
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,295
What? Why?

1028
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,506
She hates when I sit around
and I watch movies

1029
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,132
and I don't contribute.

1030
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,843
No, I'll handle this.

1031
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,511
I'm really good at
defusing mom-type rage.

1032
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,679
No, no, Juno...

1033
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,514
- Hey, seriously...
- Hey, Mark, where are you?!

1034
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,516
- I got some stuff...
- Hey, Vanessa.

1035
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,142
- Juno. What's going on?
- Oh, nothing.

1036
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,103
- What are you doing here? What's wrong?
- I went to the doctor today.

1037
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,729
Is something wrong with the baby?

1038
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:39,856
The baby's great.

1039
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,107
It's the right size and everything.

1040
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,358
I even saw its phalanges today.

1041
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:45,361
Here.

1042
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:46,529
It's a baby.

1043
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,489
- Oh...
- It's your baby.

1044
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:54,996
Kind of looks like
it's waving, you know.

1045
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,330
Like it's saying...

1046
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,125
"Hey, Vanessa, will you be my mom?"

1047
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,668
Oh, it kind of does.

1048
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,086
Right?

1049
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,463
Juno was nice enough to bring
that over for us today.

1050
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,673
Yeah, I came as soon

1051
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,050
as I got that ultrasound
goo off my pelvis.

1052
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,219
It was crazy actually.

1053
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,264
My stepmom verbally abused
the ultrasound tech

1054
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,933
and we got escorted
off the premises.

1055
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,898
Wow, what kind of
swag did you score?

1056
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,900
MARK: Mall madness, huh?

1057
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,068
It's just some stuff I picked up
for the baby.

1058
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,113
Don't you usually get all that
stuff at like a baby shower?

1059
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,616
'Cause my stepmom— she was
pregnant with my little sister

1060
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,910
and she got a million gifts,
you know?

1061
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:34,994
But I wasn't jealous,

1062
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,287
'cause they all super lame.

1063
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,164
I doubt anyone's going
to throw us a shower.

1064
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,957
Why wouldn't they throw you
a baby shower?

1065
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,083
VANESSA:
I don't think people know...

1066
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,753
how to feel about
the situation

1067
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,964
because it's...
not set in stone.

1068
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,382
What isn't set?

1069
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,469
No, no, no, no, no.

1070
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,763
You don't think that I'm going
to flake out on you?

1071
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,222
No, I don't, Juno.

1072
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,266
We went through
a situation before

1073
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,768
where it didn't work out.

1074
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:00,603
Yeah, cold feet.

1075
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,313
Oh.

1076
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,652
You should have gone to China.

1077
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,488
You know, 'cause I hear
they give away babies

1078
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:11,614
like free iPods.

1079
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,074
You know,

1080
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,201
they pretty much just put them
in those T-shirt guns

1081
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,827
and shoot them out
at sporting events.

1082
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:22,083
Your parents are probably
wondering where you are.

1083
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,794
Nah.
I mean, I'm already pregnant,

1084
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,963
so what other kind of shenanigans
could I get into?

1085
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,924
Though, I should...
I should probably bounce.

1086
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,092
Hey, don't forget your bag.

1087
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,551
Oh, bag.

1088
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,514
Thank you.

1089
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:39,392
Okay, take care.

1090
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,955
(door opening)

1091
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,165
Where the hell
have you been, June bug?

1092
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,669
I just drove to St. Cloud to show
Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound.

1093
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,838
I ended up staying
for a couple hours.

1094
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:10,131
A couple hours?!

1095
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,008
What are you going over there
in the first place?

1096
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:15,511
Oh, they just... you know,
they wanted to know about the stuff

1097
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,805
and I said I'd keep
them updated, so I did.

1098
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,515
Well, you could have
mailed it to them.

1099
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,435
Why would you drive an hour
out to East Jesus Nowhere?

1100
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,021
♪ Mm-mm! ♪
I just did.

1101
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,523
You know, and while Mark and I
were waiting for Vanessa,

1102
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,859
we, uh, we watched
The Wizard of Gore

1103
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,194
and then he burnt me

1104
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,071
a couple CDs of this weird music.

1105
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,365
So, it was cool.
He's kind of cool.

1106
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:42,496
Juno, you can't just
drop in on them like that.

1107
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,874
No, it... it was not a big deal.

1108
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,584
He was totally cool with it.

1109
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:47,960
You don't understand.

1110
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,420
Mark is a married man.

1111
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,671
There are boundaries.

1112
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,715
Oh, come on.

1113
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,384
Listen, Brenda...

1114
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,845
Now you're acting
like you're the one

1115
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,597
who has to go through this.

1116
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,682
Like you're the one
who has to get huge

1117
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,101
and shove a baby out
of your vag for someone else.

1118
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,062
And what does it even matter
if he's married?

1119
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,730
I can have friends that are married.

1120
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,106
It doesn't work that way, kiddo.

1121
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,983
You don't know squat about
the dynamics of marriage.

1122
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,818
You don't know anything about me.

1123
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,570
I know enough.

1124
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,990
We don't even have a dog.

1125
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,533
Yeah, we don't have a dog

1126
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,993
because you're allergic
to their saliva.

1127
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,079
I have sacrificed a lot

1128
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,581
for you, Juno, and in a
couple years, when you move out,

1129
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,541
I'm going to get Weimaraners.

1130
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,460
Oh, dream big.

1131
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:32,505
Oh, go fly a kite!

1132
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,529
Hey, Juno.

1133
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,531
What can I do for you?

1134
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,866
Uh, Bleeker home?

1135
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,869
Bleeker's mom was possibly
attractive once,

1136
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:08,040
but now she looks like a hobbit.

1137
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,417
You know the fat one
that was in The Goonies?

1138
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,300
Hey, man.

1139
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,593
Don't concentrate so hard.

1140
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,138
I think I can smell
your hair a-burnin'.

1141
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,347
Hey, what's up?

1142
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,308
Not much. I just...
wanted to come say hey.

1143
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,644
I mean, I miss like...just
hanging out with you

1144
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,146
on school nights, you know.

1145
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:34,859
Orange tic tacs are Bleeker's
one and only vice.

1146
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,527
The day I got pregnant,

1147
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:39,530
his mouth tasted really tangy
and delicious.

1148
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,165
Boy, you really...

1149
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,334
really seem to be getting,
uh, pregnant-er these days.

1150
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,586
Yeah.

1151
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,174
You know, I set up this
whole private adoption,

1152
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,217
and this... this
married couple

1153
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,678
in like St. Cloud, they're...
they're going to be the parents.

1154
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:03,804
- So, it's...
- Really?

1155
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,139
Yeah.

1156
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,473
Wow, what are they like?

1157
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:10,060
Well, I mean, the guy- he's awesome.

1158
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,313
His name is Mark and, um...

1159
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,981
he likes old
horror movies

1160
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,608
and he plays the guitar.

1161
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,651
We actually hung out this afternoon.

1162
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,445
Is that normal?

1163
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,238
Probably not, but...

1164
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,365
Listen, I talked

1165
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:27,411
to Dad and Bren and they said they
wouldn't narc you out to your folks, so...

1166
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,038
Okay.

1167
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,706
I think we should be cool, you know?

1168
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,541
That's a relief.

1169
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:41,884
I'm gonna start looking like
a pretty big dork soon.

1170
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:46,138
You still going to think
I'm cute when I'm huge?

1171
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,308
I always think you're cute.

1172
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,601
I think you're beautiful.

1173
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,020
Geez, Bleek.

1174
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,147
I do.

1175
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,486
Hey, June bug, you know,
when this is all over

1176
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,112
we should get the band
back together.

1177
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:05,616
Yeah. I mean, that would be...
that would be awesome.

1178
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,327
I mean, once Tino gets
the new drumhead,

1179
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,287
we're just, like, ready to rock.

1180
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,997
And, I mean, we could...

1181
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,250
we could always
get back together, too.

1182
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,459
It's an option.

1183
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,632
Oh... were we together?

1184
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:27,054
Yeah, we were once, you know...
that... that time.

1185
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,771
What about Katrina De Voort?

1186
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,606
You could totally go out
with Katrina De Voort.

1187
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:38,774
I don't like Katrina.

1188
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,359
She smells like soup.

1189
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,194
I mean, have you ever smelled her?

1190
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,238
And her whole house
smells like soup.

1191
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,872
Okay...

1192
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:58,168
So we have custard and cheesecake.

1193
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,422
They're yellow.

1194
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:04,800
Right. I wanted to pick something
that was gender-neutral

1195
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:07,428
until we get the baby
and then we can just add

1196
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:08,971
a more decisive palette.

1197
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,223
Why does everybody think
yellow is gender-neutral?

1198
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:14,935
- I don't know any guy with a yellow bedroom.
- It's for babies.

1199
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,855
I'm thinking more custard.

1200
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,315
Just with this light.

1201
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,942
I don't know, maybe I should
paint a larger swatch

1202
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,403
or just try it on
a different wall...

1203
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,450
Or you can wait a few more months.

1204
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:31,535
Like the baby's going
to come storming in here

1205
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,454
demanding dessert-colored walls.

1206
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:41,462
What to Expect says
that readying the baby's room

1207
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:44,256
is an important
process for the woman.

1208
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,008
Especially if you're adopting.

1209
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,593
It's called "nesting."

1210
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,136
Nesting?

1211
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,929
Yeah.

1212
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,558
Are you going to build
a crib out of sticks and spit?

1213
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,268
Hmm?

1214
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,020
Well, you should read the book.

1215
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,439
I flagged the daddy
chapters. They're...

1216
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,066
I think it's too early to paint.

1217
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,734
That's my opinion.

1218
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:06,278
I disagree.

1219
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,284
This wall is going
to need something.

1220
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,331
Our first family photo
right in the middle.

1221
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,458
Right up there.

1222
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,129
Can you see it?

1223
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,803
Yum! This pretzel tastes
like a friggin' donut.

1224
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:31,887
Well, share the love, sweetie.

1225
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,014
No, you can't have any.

1226
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,433
She's assaulting me.

1227
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,228
She's denying me
fresh-baked goodness.

1228
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,188
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1229
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,648
That's her.

1230
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,650
That's Vanessa Loring.

1231
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,235
Of the PennySaver Lorings?

1232
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:52,241
Dude, she's, like, really pretty.

1233
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,118
You sound, like,
totally shocked or something.

1234
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:58,705
She's totally going to, like, steal
that little kid for her collection.

1235
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,707
Right? Seriously.

1236
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,759
Boring.

1237
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:12,469
Ah...

1238
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,980
Oh, I could so go for, like,
a huge cookie right now

1239
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,774
with, like, a lamb
kebab simultaneously.

1240
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,944
God, spermie, must you always feed?

1241
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:32,823
It's like never ending,
pretty much, you know.

1242
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,158
Juno!

1243
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,492
- Hi.
- Hi, Juno.

1244
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,245
Vanessa, what, what
brings you to the mall today?

1245
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:41,331
I was just shopping, you know,
with my girlfriends, and...

1246
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,749
You're gay?

1247
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,084
- No.
- Oh, please, just ignore her.

1248
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,461
Okay.

1249
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,004
Well, how are you feeling?

1250
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:49,715
Great. Everything's
stupendous, you know.

1251
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,551
Oh, coming in on that snooze button.

1252
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,971
Wow. It's incredible.

1253
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,848
Huh. Oh, God.

1254
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,766
What?

1255
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,352
Kicking... kicking away.

1256
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:07,107
Could... could I feel it?

1257
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,734
Are you kidding?

1258
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,360
Oh.

1259
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,820
God, at school,

1260
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,114
everyone's just, like,
grabbing my belly all the time.

1261
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,033
It's crazy, but I'm
a legend, you know.

1262
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,659
They call me the cautionary whale.

1263
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,499
I can't feel anything.

1264
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:28,712
It's not moving for me.

1265
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,923
Well, you should try
talking to it,

1266
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,758
'cause, like, supposedly
they can hear you

1267
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,636
even though it's all, like,
10,000 leagues under the sea.

1268
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,269
(clears throat)

1269
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,110
Hi, baby.

1270
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,697
Um...

1271
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,366
It's me.

1272
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,451
It's... Vanessa.

1273
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,916
I can't wait to meet you.

1274
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:16,218
Can you hear me, baby?

1275
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,303
Sweet angel?

1276
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:29,856
I felt him!

1277
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,817
Oh, God.

1278
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,528
That was magical.

1279
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:35,946
(cooing)

1280
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:42,160
(quietly): Thank you. Thank you.

1281
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:53,589

Hello?

1296
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,131
Hey!

1297
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:37,174
Hi.

1298
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,258
So, um,

1299
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,301
I've been listening to that

1300
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,677
really weird CD that you made me.

1301
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,054
Yeah, what's the verdict?

1302
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,805
Well, it's cute.

1303
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,641
"It's cute"?

1304
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:46,683
When you're used to listening

1305
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,602
to the raw power
of Iggy and The Stooges,

1306
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,646
everything else just sounds
kind of like...

1307
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,105
precious in comparison.

1308
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,566
Well, I imagine you've got
a collection of punk chestnuts

1309
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,692
to prove your point.

1310
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:59,571
Well... consider it
your musical education.

1311
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,990
Can't wait to see what
you've got to teach me.

1312
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,618
Stop surfing porn
and get back to work.

1313
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:05,827
(chuckles)

1314
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,788
I just wanted to call and say hi.

1315
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:10,165
Right.
Go learn something.

1316
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,794
I'll have a little trip
down Mexico way.

1317
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,338
And Greece and China apparently.

1318
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,964
How many months has it been now?

1319
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,091
You're getting huge.

1320
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,468
Oh, it's honing in on eight.

1321
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,345
You should see
how weird I look naked.

1322
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,347
I wish my fun bags would get bigger.

1323
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,015
God, trust me, you don't.

1324
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,518
I have to actually wear
a frickin' bra now

1325
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:32,354
and rub all this nasty
cocoa butter stuff on myself

1326
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,690
so, like... I don't know,
my skin won't explode.

1327
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:35,899
Hot.

1328
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:38,902
(humming)

1329
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:41,071
Why is everyone
always staring at me?

1330
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,949
Well, you are kind of
convex, you know.

1331
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,450
Whoa-uh!

1332
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,619
Who's been doing their
geometry homework for once?

1333
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,995
I have no choice.

1334
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,790
Keith's been grading me, like,
so hard lately.

1335
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,334
Do not call Mr. Connors Keith.

1336
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,794
Why?

1337
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,879
'Cause my barf reflex
is really heightened these days.

1338
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,005
But Keith's hot.

1339
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:03,844
JUNO: Ew, he's all beardy.

1340
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:07,848
Did you hear that Bleek is going
to prom with Katrina De Voort?

1341
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,726
Katrina?!

1342
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,728
No, way, no,
he doesn't like Katrina.

1343
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,396
Must be, like, a pity date
or something.

1344
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,439
I heard he asked her.

1345
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,232
And that they're
going to Benihana

1346
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:20,193
and then prom and
then Vijay's parents' cabin.

1347
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,403
Oh, what're you talk...

1348
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:23,447
He told me that Katrina's
house smells like soup.

1349
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,073
Oh. Oh, my God, it totally does.

1350
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,409
I was there, like, four years
ago for a birthday party.

1351
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,494
Oh, my God,
it's like Lipton Landing.

1352
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:33,290
But, you know, boys have endured
way worse things for nookie.

1353
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,875
Oh, please.

1354
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:37,127
There is no way
that they're having sex.

1355
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,337
I mean, they wouldn't even
be holding hands.

1356
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,173
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.
He did it with you.

1357
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,175
Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me,
you know.

1358
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,676
We're best friends.

1359
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,553
Are you jealous?

1360
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,680
I thought you said
you didn't care what he did.

1361
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,682
Not jealous, don't care.

1362
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,101
It's just, I know Bleek
doesn't like Katrina, you know.

1363
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,770
He shouldn't toy
with her emotions like that,

1364
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,229
'cause she seems pretty nice.

1365
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,565
Uh-huh,
I'm really convinced.

1366
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,275
You know, prom is
for weenuses anyway.

1367
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:04,029
As soon as you you're old enough
to go, it's so not cool anymore.

1368
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:16,166
Are you honestly and truly going
to prom with Katrina De Voort?

1369
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,460
Uh, hi.

1370
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,170
Leah just-just said that
you were going to go with her.

1371
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:22,297
Yeah, I did ask her
if she wanted to go.

1372
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,965
Um, a bunch of us
from the team

1373
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,468
are going to go to Benihana
and then go to the prom

1374
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,553
and then go
to Vijay's parents' cabin,

1375
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,555
so...

1376
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,017
We-we-we're getting a stretch limo.

1377
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:37,395
Your mom must be pretty stoked
that you're not taking me.

1378
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,315
You're mad. Why are you mad?

1379
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,150
I'm not mad. I'm in a...

1380
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,985
I'm in a great mood.

1381
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,779
I mean, despite the fact
that well, I'm in a fat suit

1382
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:47,280
that I can't take off
and despite the fact

1383
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,075
that pretty much everyone's
making fun of me behind my back

1384
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,536
and despite the fact
that your little girlfriend

1385
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,080
gave me the stink eye
in art class yesterday...

1386
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,206
Katrina's not my girlfriend,
all right?

1387
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,874
And I doubt that
she gave you the stink eye.

1388
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,876
That's just... the way
her face looks, you know.

1389
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,503
That's just her face.

1390
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:06,633
Yeah, what... You-you just take
Soupy Sales to prom.

1391
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:09,135
I can think of so many
cooler things to do that night.

1392
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,555
Like, you know what, Bleek?
I might pumice my feet.

1393
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:13,723
I might go to
Bren's dumb Unitarian Church.

1394
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,560
Maybe get hit by a truck full of
hot garbage juice, you know,

1395
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,062
'cause all those things
would be exponentially cooler

1396
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:20,981
than going to prom with you.

1397
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,902
You're being really immature.

1398
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,321
You have no reason to be mad at me.

1399
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,657
I mean, you know,
you broke my heart.

1400
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:33,493
I... I should be royally
ticked off at you, you know.

1401
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,828
I should be really cheesed off.

1402
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,205
I shouldn't want to talk
to you anymore.

1403
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,333
Ooh, what, 'cause I got bored
and had sex with you

1404
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,544
and I didn't want
to, like, marry you?

1405
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:44,546
Like I'd marry you?
You'd be the meanest wife ever,

1406
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,007
okay? And I know that you
weren't bored that day,

1407
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,925
because there was a lot
of stuff on TV,

1408
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,928
and-and the Blair Witch Project
was coming on Starz.

1409
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,347
And you were like, "I haven't
seen this since it came out."

1410
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,765
And if so, we should watch it.

1411
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,518
And then but, "Oh, no, we should
make out instead," la, la, la.

1412
01:04:58,603 --> 01:04:59,895
(scoffs)

1413
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,898
You just, you just take Katrina
the douche packer to prom.

1414
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:06,234
I'm, I'm sure you two will have,
like, a real bitchin' time.

1415
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,237
Well, I still have your underwear.

1416
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,239
I still...
I have your virginity.

1417
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,366
Would you shut up?

1418
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:14,951
What, are you ashamed
that we did it?

1419
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,286
No.

1420
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,746
Because at least
you don't have to have

1421
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,789
the evidence under your sweater.

1422
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,960
I'm a planet.

1423
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,423
Wait, wait, let me get your bag.

1424
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:29,591
You shouldn't be carrying...

1425
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,134
What's another ten pounds?

1426
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:33,219

Oh, that's hilarious.

1456
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,541
Now, this is where I keep
all my old comics,

1457
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,167
- Huh.
- and I want to show you one.

1458
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,585
You're one of those guys?

1459
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,587
Take a look.

1460
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,256
Huh?

1461
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,509
Most Fruitful Yuki.

1462
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:55,593
Mm-hmm.

1463
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,595
Is this a pregnant superhero?

1464
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,888
Isn't that great?

1465
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,598
I found it in Japan
when I was there with my band.

1466
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,683
It reminds me of you.

1467
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:04,185
- Hells, yeah!
- Yeah.

1468
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,981
This actually makes me feel
way less of a fat dork.

1469
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:10,650
Well, Yuki is a real bad-ass.

1470
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:13,111
You should be very proud
to be in the same condition.

1471
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:16,197
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1472
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:17,407
Oh, how about some tuneage?

1473
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,034
- Tuneage?
- Yeah.

1474
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,327
- I got a bunch...
- All right, don't look. Número trois.

1475
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:22,579
Not looking.

1476
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:25,540
Um, okay, this one
is actually kind of slow,

1477
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:29,586
but it's Mott The Hoople,
so it's still totally rad...

1478
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,087
and hardcore.

1479
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,173
(rock intro begins)

1480
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:36,760
- What?
- I know this one.

1481
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,053
- You do?
- Yeah.

1482
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,555
This song is older than I am,
if you can believe it.

1483
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:42,348
I danced to this at my senior prom.

1484
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,976
Who'd you dance with?

1485
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,771
Cynthia Vogel.
Great dance partner.

1486
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,065
- She let me put my hands all over her butt.
- Hot.

1487
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:51,191
Very hot.

1488
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:55,070
I can just totally
picture you dancing

1489
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:57,238
- like a total dork.
- (chuckles)

1490
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,866
Actually...

1491
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:02,327
her hands...

1492
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,661
were there.

1493
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,455
I put my hands down here.

1494
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:08,166
Th-this, this... this
is how we did it in '88.

1495
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,584
- Like this?
- Just like this.

1496
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:11,503
Have you ever been
to a dance before?

1497
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:14,172
Dances are for nerds and squares.

1498
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:16,758
What are you?

1499
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,927
I don't know.

1500
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,180
Does it feel like there's
something between us?

1501
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,932

Got it all planned.

1511
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,708
This is something I've been
wanting to do for a long time.

1512
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:51,960
- No.
- No?

1513
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:54,254
No, you definitely...
can't do that.

1514
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:57,298
That's one big, fat sack of... no!

1515
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,884
- What is the matter?
- Wh— di— I...

1516
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:03,805
I mean... you guys are supposed
to take care of this, you know?

1517
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,559
- I thought you'd be cool with this.
- Cool?

1518
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:10,228
I-I want things to be perfect.

1519
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,564
I don't want them to be
shitty and broken

1520
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,232
like everyone else's family.

1521
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,485
Look, I'll have the baby,

1522
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,821
and Vanessa's going to be so happy.

1523
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,322
You just...

1524
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,408
A baby's not going to fix
everything, besides I don't know

1525
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:24,993
if I'm even ready to be a father.

1526
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:26,035
But you're old.

1527
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,370
(scoffs)

1528
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:32,000
How do you think of me?

1529
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,627
You know, why are you over here?

1530
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:41,050
I... I just like being

1531
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,553
a piece of furniture
in your weird life.

1532
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,763
This? This is what
my life has become.

1533
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,308
I mean, you know,
I got stuff in boxes.

1534
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:49,392
You know, I'm underground.

1535
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:51,102
That's appealing to you?

1536
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,520
- Is this my fault?
- No.

1537
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,023
Is Vanessa, like, mad at you
because of me or something?

1538
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:56,357
That's got nothing to do with it.

1539
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,650
Vanessa and I aren't
in love anymore.

1540
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,694
Well, you were in love
when you married her.

1541
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:02,363
And if you're in love once,
you can be in love again

1542
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,490
like my friend, Leah,
who's been with the same guy,

1543
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,075
like, four different times.

1544
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,119
- You're just not trying hard enough.
- I'm such an idiot.

1545
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,412
I can't believe what an idiot I am.

1546
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:10,580
No, no, you know what, Mark...

1547
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:14,209
Just do not divorce your wife.

1548
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,419
Will you please
just do me a solid

1549
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:18,171
and stay with Vanessa?

1550
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:20,840
You're so young.

1551
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,884
Oh, I'm not that young.
Okay, I'm 16.

1552
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:24,761
All right, I'm old enough
to know when someone's

1553
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:26,554
acting like a total a-hole.

1554
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,806
Oh, and you know what?

1555
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,684
I bought another Sonic Youth
album and it sucks!

1556
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,436
It's just noise.

1557
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:40,109
Juno? What's going on?

1558
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,445
Nothing.

1559
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:44,322
Why are you crying?

1560
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:45,907
I'm not crying,

1561
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:48,451
I'm just allergic
to fine home furnishings.

1562
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:50,453
Hold on. What's the matter?

1563
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:51,663
What's the matter?

1564
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,623
Just a little hormonal.

1565
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:54,916
Right, Juno?

1566
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,502
Just part of the process.

1567
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:02,423
What did you do?

1568
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:05,843
I didn't do anything.

1569
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,930
Just, um...

1570
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:14,769
I've been thinking...

1571
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:16,312
- What?
- You know, I've just—

1572
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:18,940
I'm thinking if this
is the right thing.

1573
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:21,317
What are you talking about?

1574
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,821
Just wondering if it's...

1575
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:26,239
just wondering if we're ready.

1576
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:28,783
Yeah, we're ready.

1577
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,034
We're ready.
We've read the books.

1578
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,286
We've taken all the classes.

1579
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:32,954
We've have a nursery

1580
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:34,289
- that is completely...
- Vanessa.

1581
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:35,707
I know we're prepared.

1582
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:38,126
I'm just wondering if...

1583
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:41,004
I'm ready.

1584
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,383
Wait a minute.

1585
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:46,551
Wait, Juno,

1586
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:47,635
don't listen to him.

1587
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,137
He's just got cold feet.

1588
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:50,680
He's just being a guy.

1589
01:11:50,764 --> 01:11:52,390
The books all say the same thing.

1590
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:54,559
"A woman becomes a mother
when she gets pregnant.

1591
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,228
A man becomes a father
when he sees his baby."

1592
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,188
He's going to get there.

1593
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:01,816
- He's... he's going to get there.
- It happened so fast.

1594
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,651
You know, we put
the ad in the paper

1595
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,654
and I thought that it was going
to take months, if at all,

1596
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,740
and then, two weeks later,
she's on that couch.

1597
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,491
Well, she answered our prayers.

1598
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:13,870
Ever since then, it's been,
like, a ticking clock.

1599
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:18,750
What are you saying?

1600
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:23,046
That it feels a little
like bad timing.

1601
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:29,344
What would be a good time
for you, Mark?

1602
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,972
There's just some things
that I still want to do.

1603
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,767
Like what? Be a rock star?

1604
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,852
Don't mock me.

1605
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:41,606
I'm just saying that this is...

1606
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,691
this is something
that's never going to happen.

1607
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,695
You know...

1608
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,322
your shirt is stupid.

1609
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:51,616
Grow up.

1610
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,369
If I have to wait for you
to become Kurt Cobain,

1611
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:56,371
I'm never going to be a mother.

1612
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,585
I never said I'd be a good father.

1620
01:15:57,844 --> 01:16:00,179
I called Gerta Rauss
and she said that

1621
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,223
she can represent both of us.

1622
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:04,100
It's called
a "collaborative divorce."

1623
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:07,270
It's all the rage
right now, supposedly.

1624
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:08,521
It'd be pretty easy

1625
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:09,814
'cause we don't have any children.

1626
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,316
Thanks for making the call, I guess.

1627

Yeah, downtown.

A hotel?

1630
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,414
No, it's not a hotel, it's a loft.

01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,500
Well, aren't you the cool guy.

1632
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:37,049

Hey, Dad.

1644
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,633
Hey, big puffy version of June bug.

1645
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:02,677
Where you been?

1646
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:06,430
Oh, just out dealing with things

Well, Bren took Liberty Bell
to her tot ice-skating class.

1650
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:18,150
When will you guys learn
that tots can't ice-skate?

1651
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:21,362
You're looking
a little morose, honey.

1652
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:22,780
What's eating you?

1653
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,282
Oh...

1654
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:34,083
I'm just, like, losing
my faith with humanity.

1655
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:36,794
Wow, can you narrow that down
for me?

1656
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:40,631
I just... wonder if, like,

1657
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:44,427
two people can
stay together for good.

1658
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:46,762
You mean, like couples?

1659
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:49,640
Yeah, like...
people in love.

1660
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,183
Are you having boy trouble?

1661
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:53,728
'Cause I got to be honest,
I don't really much approve

1662
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,438
of you dating in your condition.

1663
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:57,898
That's...
that's kind of messed up.

1664
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,234
- No, Dad, it's not...
- I mean, that's pretty skanky.

1665
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:02,820
Isn't that what
you girls call it— skanky?

1666
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:04,196
- Skeevy?
- Please stop.

1667
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:05,281
Tore up from the floor up?

1668
01:19:05,365 --> 01:19:08,242
That's... that's
not what it's about, it...

1669
01:19:11,204 --> 01:19:14,498
I just... I need to know
that it's possible

1670
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:18,461
that two people can stay happy
together forever.

1671
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:21,756
Well, it's not easy,
that's for sure.

1672
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,467
And, uh, I don't have the best
track record in the world,

1673
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:26,177
I know, but...

1674
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,429
I've been with your stepmother
for ten years now,

1675
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:31,432
and, um, I'm proud to say,
we're very happy.

1676
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,393
Look...

1677
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:39,315
in my opinion, the best thing
you can do is find a person

1678

for exactly what you are.

still gonna think

that's worth sticking with.

01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:02,338
Yeah.

1686
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:08,385
Yeah, and I think
I've found that person.

1687
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,679

Hey, did you put, like,

1712
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:37,725
a hundred things of
tic tacs in my mailbox?

1713
01:21:37,809 --> 01:21:39,935
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that was me.

1714
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,228
Why?

1715
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:43,564
Well, you know,
they're your fave,

1716
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:45,816

Yeah, well, thanks.

1720
01:21:49,529 --> 01:21:51,614

I'm pretty much set

1721
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:54,199
until college on the tic tac front.

1722
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:55,951
You know, Bleek, I was thinking...

1723
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:58,787
and I'm sorry
I was such a huge bitch to you.

1724
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:00,331
You don't deserve it.

1725
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:03,417

it's okay.

1729
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:16,931
No. I mean, for real.

1730
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:21,644
'Cause you're, like, the coolest
person I've ever met,

1731
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:25,064
and you don't even have to try.

1732
01:22:25,148 --> 01:22:27,733
I try really hard, actually.

You're, like, naturally smart,

1734

1735
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,281
