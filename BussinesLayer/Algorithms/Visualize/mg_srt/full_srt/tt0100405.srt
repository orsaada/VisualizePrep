1
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,853
...broke in right on the tour.

2
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:21,189
No matter what they say,
it's all about money.

3
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:24,151
So let's imagine, ladies, that you're
a savings and loan officer.

4
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:26,653
Watch. One, two, three.

5
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:29,990
See? You've got it all,
and we've got nothin'.

6
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:32,367
- And you have all four. Take a look.
- Oh!

7
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,038
But I wouldn't trust you with
real gold. That's why this one's
only worth about a penny.

8
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:39,666
- Hmm.
- And if you wonder where
the other one went, watch.

9
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,210
Penny from the ear.
How much for the rest?

10
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:45,047
- Have you seen Edward?
- No, I haven't. Great party, Philip.

11
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,799
Well, my wife went to a lot of trouble.
She called a caterer.

12
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:49,885
- Excuse me, Anne. Howard, how are ya?
- Philip, good.

13
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:52,012
Hey, I understand Edward's
taking over Morse Industries.

14
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:54,348
- Yeah, well, he's not
here to get a suntan.
- Can I get in on it?

15
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:56,224
- Yeah, call me.
- When?
- Just call me.

16
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:58,935
Uh, hi. I'm Philip Stuckey,
Edward Lewis' lawyer.

17
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:01,104
- Hey, where's
the guest of honour anyway?
- Well, if I know him,

18
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:06,026
he's probably off in a corner
somewhere charming a very
pretty lady. How are you?

19
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,820
I told my secretary to make
the arrangements. Didn't she call you?

20
00:01:08,904 --> 00:01:12,824
<i>Yes, she did. I speak to your secretary</i>
<i>more than I speak to you.</i>

21
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:15,702
- I see.
- <i>I have my own life too,</i>
<i>you know, Edward.</i>

22
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:18,747
This is a very important week for me.
I need you here.

23
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,085
<i>But you never give me any notice. You</i>
<i>just think I'm at your beck and call.</i>

24
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:26,254
I do not believe that you
are at my "beck and call."

25
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:29,591
<i>Well, that's the way you always make me</i>
<i>feel. Maybe I should just move out.</i>

26
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:33,095
- If that's what you want, yes.
- <i>All right, when you get back</i>
<i>to New York, we'll discuss it.</i>

27
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:36,515
- Now is as good a time as any.
- <i>That's fine with me, Edward. Goodbye.</i>

28
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,517
Goodbye, Jessica.

29
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:46,108
- Phil suggested that maybe
I should take a look...
- Phil is just my lawyer, okay?

30
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:49,069
- Yes, sir.
- How did the Morse stock open
at the Nikkei?

31
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,071
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

32
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:54,282
Tokyo opened maybe 90 minutes ago.
You have to keep on top
of these things, all right?

33
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:56,284
- Done.
- Hello, Mr Lewis.
- Hi, hi. How ya doin'?

34
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:59,413
I want this whole thing
wrapped up as soon as possible.
I gotta get to New York by Sunday.

35
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:00,956
- I got tickets to the Met.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,501
- Your coat, Mr Lewis.
- Thank you.

37
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:07,212
- Edward!
- Susan!

38
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,922
- Hi.
- Hi.

39
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:12,092
- I was sorry to hear about Carter.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

40
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:16,304
- Heard you got married.
- Well, yeah, I couldn't wait for you.

41
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:20,434
- Susan, tell me something.
- Yes?

42
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:25,939
When you and I were dating,
did you speak to my secretary
more than you spoke to me?

43
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:28,608
She was one of my bridesmaids.

44
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,695
Huh.

45
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:35,407
- Your husband's a very lucky guy. Bye.
- Thanks. Bye.

46
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,659
...up to you.
- Absolutely.
- Wonderful.

47
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:40,203
He's leaving.
Edward's leaving.

48
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:42,205
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

49
00:02:43,457 --> 00:02:46,376
Is this Mr Stuckey's car?

50
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,838
- Edward, where ya goin'?
- You got the keys to your car?

51
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,465
Why? What's wrong with the limo?

52
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:54,676
Look, the limo is buried back there.
Darryl can't get it out.

53
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:56,887
- Please give me the keys.
- All right, look.
I don't think you should drive.

54
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,806
You're a little excited. Don't drive
my car. Let me work something out here.

55
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:03,185
Fellas, what kind of a system is this?
Can you move these cars out of here?

56
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:06,396
- Look, Edward, Edward.
Are you familiar with a stick shift?
- Oh, yeah.

57
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,856
- Have you driven a shift?
- Yeah. Yeah.

58
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:10,150
Listen... All right. Just...
Just be ginger with it. Don't...

59
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:13,362
- It's a new car. Don't...
- Okay, I can do it.
- It's just a little... Edward!

60
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,614
- Give me a break, please?
- I love this car.

61
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:17,616
I love it too. Look, you don't
even know where you're going.

62
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:20,077
You... You're gonna
get lost in the dark!

63
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,079
Beverly Hills is down the hill!

64
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,212
<i>I don't need to fall at your feet</i>

65
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:33,340
<i>Just 'cause you cut me to the bone</i>

66
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,596
- <i>And I won't miss</i>
<i>the way that you kiss me</i>
- Oh, shit!

67
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,891
<i>We were never carved in stone</i>

68
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:49,398
<i>If I don't listen</i>
<i>to the talk of the town</i>

69
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,901
<i>Then maybe I can fool myself</i>

70
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:57,114
<i>I'll get over you</i>
<i>I know I will</i>

71
00:03:57,197 --> 00:04:01,743
<i>I'll pretend my ship's not sinking</i>

72
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:05,997
<i>And I'll tell myself I'm over you</i>

73
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:09,167
<i>- 'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking</i>
- Maps here! Maps!

74
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,503
Good one.

75
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:18,093
- What do you say, blondie?
- Hi, honey. Want some fun?

76
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:23,265
- Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date?
- Yeah, honey, we're lookin'.

77
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:26,059
- Well, here I am.
- I'm Al, and this is my friend, Joe.

78
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:28,020
Get in the car.

79
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:02,471
<i>Well, I'm just outta school</i>
<i>Like I'm real, real cool</i>

80
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:04,097
<i>Gotta dance like a fool</i>

81
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,143
<i>Got the message</i>
<i>and I gotta be a wild one</i>

82
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:10,354
<i>Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one</i>

83
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:15,317
<i>Gonna break the news</i>
<i>Gonna keep on movin' wild</i>

00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:19,696
<i>Gonna keep on swingin', baby</i>
<i>I'm a real wild child</i>

85
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:27,412
Now wait a minute.
You don't seem to understand me.

86
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:32,250
That's my job. At the end of the month,
I collect everybody's rent.

87
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:35,170
Now give me the money,
or you're outta here.

88
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,967
<i>Gonna meet all my friends</i>
<i>Gonna have ourself a ball</i>

89
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:46,598
<i>Gonna tell my friends</i>
<i>Gonna tell them all that I'm a wild one</i>

90
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:49,101
<i>Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one</i>

91
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:53,814
<i>Gonna break the news</i>
<i>Gonna keep on movin' wild</i>

92
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:57,526
<i>Gonna keep on swingin', baby</i>

93
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:19,381
<i>I'm a real wild one</i>

94
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:22,634
<i>In a world goin'crazy</i>

00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:24,928
<i>I'm a wild one</i>

96
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:27,264
<i>Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one</i>

97
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:32,185
<i>Gonna break the news</i>
<i>Gonna keep on movin' wild</i>

98
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:36,898
<i>Gonna keep on swingin', baby</i>
<i>I'm a real wild child</i>

99
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,610
Welcome to Hollywood! Everybody
comes to Hollywood got a dream.

100
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:42,612
What's your dream?

101
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:47,409
What's your dream? Hey, mister?
Hey! What's your dream?

102
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:51,872
Have a good one.

103
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:55,625
- What happened?
- Some chick. She bought it over there.

104
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:58,754
Detective Albertson.
What do you know about that girl?

105
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:00,964
I'll tell you, man.
I don't know who she hang with.

106
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:04,092
Come on, guy. We just pulled her
out of a Dumpster in the back.
Who was her pimp?

107
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:06,345
Cocaine her pimp.
She a strawberry.

108
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:11,266
She be out on these streets
day in, day out, tradin' her
sorry self for some crack.

109
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,685
- And, and what do you do?
- I cool.

110
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:15,854
Oh, I'll bet. Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

111
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:17,898
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Awful.
- What are you, from the press?

112
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,567
- No, no. We're from Orlando.
- Oh, I don't believe this.

113
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:22,819
Do you see... I got tourists
photographing the body, Al.

114
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:25,614
I don't know what happened.
A man in a blue...

115
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:40,295
<i>In a world that can be so insane</i>

116
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:44,299
<i>I don't think it's very strange</i>
<i>for me to be in love with you</i>

117
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:47,219
<i>I wanna know more than your brain</i>

118
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:52,307
- Hey, Pops, has Kit been in here?
- Upstairs in the pool room.

119
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:56,061
<i>Not something that I'm expecting</i>
<i>Now I smile for your affection</i>

120
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:58,146
<i>We have made a soul connection</i>

121
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,148
<i>Just for me does your bell toll</i>

122
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:02,109
<i>Don't be cold</i>
<i>Show me your soul</i>

123
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:07,155
- Yo, Viv!
- Is it all gone?

124
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:10,158
Carlos, you know my roommate, Vivian.
This is Angel. That's Bermuda.

125
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,369
I know everybody.
Is it all gone, Kit?

126
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:15,247
Carlos sold me some great shit. We just
had this party. I was the hostess.

127
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,834
I can't believe you
bought drugs with our rent!
What is going on with you, Kit?

128
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:21,920
- I needed a little pick-me-up.
- Oh, well, we need rent money!

129
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:25,382
- Whoa. Calm down, <i>chica.</i>
She only owes me 200 more.
- Carlos!

130
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:27,843
- Another 200 dollars?
- That was from way before.

131
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:29,845
That's right, 200, Vivian.

132
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:33,181
But if you wanna work off her money
with me, we can work something out.

133
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:35,517
That's a very sweet offer,
Carlos, but not now.

134
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,312
- Come on, Viv. Come downstairs.
- Work out... Work out what?
What do we work out?

135
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:42,774
- You really like her, Carlos?
- You took it while I was sleeping?

136
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:45,610
- You were unavailable for consultation.
- Hey, let's go.

137
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:48,864
Snack! Snack!

138
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:52,367
- Besides, it's my apartment.
- Yeah, well, I have
to live there too, Kit.

139
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:56,038
Look, you came here, I gave you
some money, I gave you a place to stay,

140
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:58,040
and some valuable vocational advice.

141
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:01,877
He was on my case. I had to give him
something. So don't irritate me.

142
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,046
This ain't a buffet, Kit!

143
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:06,131
"Irritate you"? "Irritate you"?

144
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:09,301
I just saw a girl
pulled out of a Dumpster.

145
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:13,513
I know. Skinny Marie.
But she was a, a flake.

146
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:16,224
She was a crackhead. Dominic was
trying to straighten her out for months.

147
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:19,144
- Hey, you just knocked my drink...
- Get off of her!
- Leave her alone!

148
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:22,564
Don't you wanna get outta here?

149
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:26,568
Get out where?
Where the fuck you wanna go?

150
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,614
Ah, this stuff.
There's nothin' but garbage.

151
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:33,617
- Uh, excuse me.
- Huh?
- Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?

152
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,830
You're here! That's
Sylvester Stallone's house right there!

153
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:40,916
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

154
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:45,295
- Hey, yo, Rachel?
- What?

155
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:48,674
- Yeah, you see the stars
on the sidewalk, babe?
- Yeah.

156
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:51,093
Well, Vivian and me,
we work Bob Hope,

157
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:53,136
we work the Ritz Brothers,
we work Fred Astaire...

158
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,639
we work all the way down
to Ella Fitzgerald.

159
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:58,975
This is our turf. We got seniority.
You better get off our corner.

160
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:02,312
Forgive me. I was just takin'
a rest here. Besides, she's new.

161
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:06,650
Yeah, well, I'm old. So go rest up
by Monty Hall or Esther Wilson.

162
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,860
- Williams.
- Esther Williams, where you belong!

163
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:11,446
Back off, Kit. You know,
you're really becoming a grouch.

164
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:17,786
- Am I really a grouch?
- Yes. Sometimes.

165
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:21,206
Well, just 'cause I'm hungry!
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

166
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:24,543
- Hey, girls!
- Hey, yo, baby!

167
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:26,628
How 'bout a freebie?
It's my birthday!

168
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:28,630
Dream on!

169
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:33,051
It's looking really slow tonight.

170
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:37,139
Yeah, well, maybe we should get a pimp,
you know. Carlos really digs you.

171
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:41,852
And then he'll run our lives
and take our money. No.

172
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:45,480
You're right. We say who,
we say when, we say how much.

173
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:50,986
- Do you think I look
like Carol Channing?
- No, I love this look.

174
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:54,031
It's very glamorous.
Glamour choice.

175
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:57,034
Oh, yo! Oh, yo! Catch this.

176
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:01,538
Wait a minute.
That's a Lotus Esprit.

177
00:11:03,498 --> 00:11:06,418
No, that's rent.
You should go for him.

178
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:08,795
You look hot tonight.
Don't take less than a hundred.

179
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:11,173
Call me when you're through.
Take care of you.

180
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:13,175
Take care of you.

181
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:19,765
Work it. Work it, baby. Work it.

182
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,767
Work it! Own it!

183
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,189
Yes, you can handle this.
First is here somewhere.

184
00:11:28,774 --> 00:11:31,693
Hey, sugar,
you lookin' for a date?

185
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:34,196
No, I wanna find Beverly Hills.
Can you give me directions?

186
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:36,865
Sure, for five bucks.

187
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:42,120
- Ridiculous!
- Price just went up to ten.

188
00:11:42,204 --> 00:11:46,291
- You can't charge me for directions.
- I can do anything I want to, baby.
I ain't lost.

189
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:56,593
All right. Okay. All right. You win,
I lose. Got change for a twenty?

190
00:11:56,677 --> 00:12:00,472
For twenty I'll show you personal.
Even show you where the stars live.

191
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:02,641
Oh, that's all right.
I already been to Stallone's.

192
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:05,894
Right. Uh, down the street.
Make a right.

193
00:12:07,437 --> 00:12:09,606
Lights!
Lights would be good here.

194
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:16,279
- This is a hot car!
- It's a little, little temperamental.

195
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:18,156
- Yours?
- No, it isn't.

196
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:20,951
- Stolen?
- N-Not exactly.

197
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:23,120
What's your name?

198
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:25,414
What do you want it to be?

199
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,043
Vivian. My name is Vivian.

200
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:32,587
Vivian.

201
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:36,008
- So what hotel you staying at?
- The, uh, Regent Beverly Wilshire.

202
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:38,010
Then down the block,
right at the corner.

203
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:47,561
Man, this baby must corner
like it's on rails.

204
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:50,605
Beg your pardon?

205
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:53,525
Well, doesn't it blow your mind?
This is only four cylinders!

206
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:57,112
You know about cars.
W-Where did that come from?

207
00:12:57,154 --> 00:13:01,283
<i>Road and Track.</i> Boys back home
I grew up with, they were really
into American heavy metal.

208
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:05,620
Mustangs, Corvettes.
They bought 'em cheap and fixed 'em up.
I paid attention.

209
00:13:05,704 --> 00:13:08,540
So how is it you know
so little about cars?

210
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:10,625
My first car was a limousine.

211
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:17,966
So where is this... heavy metal home?

212
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:20,761
Millageville, Georgia.

213
00:13:20,802 --> 00:13:23,263
You know, I think you left
your transmission back there.

214
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:25,724
You're not shifting right.
This is a standard "H."

215
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:28,226
Standard "H."
Like I know what that means.

216
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:32,314
You ever driven a Lotus?

217
00:13:32,356 --> 00:13:35,484
- No.
- You're gonna start right now.

218
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:38,278
- You're joking.
- No, it's the only way
I can get you off my coat.

219
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,870
Fasten your seat belt. I am taking you
for the ride of your life.

220
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:49,498
I'm gonna show you what this car
can really do. Are you ready?

221
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:50,707
- I am ready.
- Hang on.

222
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,250
- Okay.
- Here we go.

223
00:13:58,048 --> 00:14:01,843
This has pedals like a race car.
They're really close together.

224
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:05,263
So it's probably easier for a woman
to drive 'cause they have little feet.

225
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:09,351
Except me. I wear a size nine.

226
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:11,770
You know, your foot's as big as your arm
from your elbow to your wrist?

227
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:16,149
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

228
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:18,235
Just a little bit of trivia.

229
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,201
Tell me, what kind of... What kind
of money you girls make these days?

230
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:29,329
- Ballpark.
- Can't take less than a hundred dollars.

231
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:32,958
- Hundred dollars a night?
- For an hour.

232
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:36,461
An hour?

233
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:39,548
You make a hundred dollars an hour
and you got a safety pin
holding your boot up?

234
00:14:40,924 --> 00:14:43,969
- You gotta be joking.
- I never joke about money.

235
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:46,888
Neither do I.

236
00:14:46,972 --> 00:14:49,975
Hundred dollars an hour.
Pretty stiff.

237
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:56,940
Well, no, but it's got potential.

238
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:19,755
Good evening, Mr Lewis. Will you
be needing the car any more tonight?

239
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:21,757
I hope not!

240
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,262
Ah... you're here.

241
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:30,265
Yeah.

242
00:15:34,186 --> 00:15:39,316
- So you'll be all right?
- Yeah, I'm gonna grab
a cab with my 20 bucks.

243
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,778
Go back to your office.

244
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:45,155
Yeah! My office. Yeah.

245
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:48,533
Well, thanks for the ride.

246
00:15:51,536 --> 00:15:53,538
- See ya.
- Goodbye.

247
00:16:06,802 --> 00:16:08,720
No taxis?

248
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:12,391
No, I like the bus.

249
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:19,356
I was thinking. Did you really
say a hundred dollars an hour?

250
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:21,358
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Hmm.

251
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:25,862
Well, if you don't have
any prior engagements,

252
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:29,574
I would be very pleased if you
would accompany me into the hotel.

253
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:31,576
You got it.

254
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:37,833
- What is your name?
- Edward.

255
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:40,335
Edward? That's my favourite name
in the whole world.

256
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:42,629
- No!
- I tell you what.

257
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:44,840
This is fate, Edward.
That's what this is.

258
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:50,971
- Now why don't you put this on?
- Why?

259
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:56,601
Well, this hotel is not
the kind of establishment
that rents rooms by the hour.

260
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:57,853
Ah.

261
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:06,403
- Wow!
- It's all right.

262
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:12,743
- Holy shit.
- You're gonna be fine.

263
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:16,204
Come with me.
And stop fidgeting.

264
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:20,375
- Good evening, Mr Lewis.
- Hello. You have messages?

265
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,377
- Yes, we have several.
- Thank you.

266
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:29,885
Would you send up some champagne
and strawberries, please?

267
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:33,388
Of course.
Room service for Mr Lewis, please.

268
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:50,364
Oh, honey. You know what's happened?
I've got a runner in my panty hose!

269
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:54,451
I'm not wearing panty hose!

270
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:02,417
Well, colour me happy!
There's a sofa in here for two!

271
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:06,588
- First time in an elevator.
- Ah.

272
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:10,217
Close your mouth, dear.

273
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:16,890
- Sorry. Couldn't help it.
- Try.

274
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:28,110
- Penthouse.
- The penthouse! Mm!
- Yes.

275
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:31,613
To the left.

276
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:51,258
Oh, I miss keys.

277
00:19:06,815 --> 00:19:10,277
- Impressed?
- You kidding me?
I come here all the time.

278
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:13,321
- As a matter of fact,
they do rent this room by the hour.
- Sure they do.

279
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:19,161
Wow! Great view!

280
00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:22,164
I bet you can see all the way
to the ocean from out here.

281
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:25,167
I'll take your word for it.
I don't go out there.

282
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,419
Why don't you go out there?

283
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:30,005
- I'm afraid of heights.
- You are?

284
00:19:30,088 --> 00:19:32,382
So how come you rented the penthouse?

285
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:36,303
It's the best. I looked all around
for penthouses on the first floor,

286
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:38,305
but I can't find one.

287
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:45,937
Well, now that you have me here,
what are you going to do with me?

288
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:48,565
- Wanna know something?
I don't have a clue.
- No?

289
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:50,901
I hadn't exactly planned this.

290
00:19:50,984 --> 00:19:53,695
Well, do you plan everything?

291
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:58,575
- Always.
- Yeah. Me too.

292
00:19:58,658 --> 00:20:01,244
I'm actually... No, I'm not a planner.
I wouldn't say I was a planner.

293
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:05,332
I would say I was, um, a kinda
"fly by the seat of my pants" gal.

294
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:09,294
You know? Moment to moment.
That's me. That's... Yeah.

295
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:13,423
Mm-hmm.

296
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:17,010
You know, you could pay me.
That's one way to maybe break the ice.

297
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:19,513
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

298
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:21,723
Uh, I assume cash is acceptable?

299
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:24,059
Cash works for me. Yeah.

300
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:34,027
You're on my fax.

301
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,447
Well, that's one
I haven't been on before.

302
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:43,203
Cute. Very cute. Thank you.

303
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:46,081
All right. Here we go.

304
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:48,083
Pick one. I got red,
I got green, I got yellow.

305
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,753
I'm outta purple, but I do have
one Gold Circle Coin left.

306
00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:55,549
The condom of champions.
The one and only.
Nothin' is gettin' through this sucker.

307
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,343
- What do you say? Hmm?
- A buffet of safety.

308
00:20:58,427 --> 00:21:00,804
I'm a safety girl.

309
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:07,853
- All right.
Let's get one of these on you.
- Hey, hey, no. I...

310
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:14,860
Why don't we just talk
for a little bit, okay?

311
00:21:14,943 --> 00:21:17,112
Talk. Yeah.

312
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:19,156
Um, okay.

313
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:24,077
Edward, are you in town on,
uh, business or pleasure?

314
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:27,956
- Business, I think.
- Business, you think.

315
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:33,420
Well, let me guess.

316
00:21:33,462 --> 00:21:36,715
That would make you... a lawyer.

317
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,427
- A lawyer?
- Mm-hmm.

318
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:42,429
What makes you think I'm a lawyer?

319
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:45,932
You've got that, um,
sharp, useless look about you.

320
00:21:48,602 --> 00:21:50,937
Bet you've known a lot of lawyers.

321
00:21:50,979 --> 00:21:52,981
I've known a lot of everybody.

322
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:57,652
What is that?

323
00:21:59,237 --> 00:22:02,824
- Champagne.
- Oh. Well.

324
00:22:02,866 --> 00:22:06,661
Might as well make myself useful.
Take a load off.

325
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,837
- Good evening.
- Hi.

326
00:22:18,715 --> 00:22:22,010
- Uh, where would you like it?
- Where would we like it?

327
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:24,096
Uh, over by the bar.

328
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:35,524
- Excuse me.
- It'll be on your bill, Mr Lewis.

329
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:37,526
Thank you.

330
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:42,447
What are you looking at?

331
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:46,493
- What is he looking at?
- Uh, yes. Here we go.

332
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:49,746
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much, sir.
Have a nice evening.

333
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,792
Tip. Wow.
I missed that one. I'll...

334
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,794
Don't worry about it.

335
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:58,630
- You mind if I take my boots off?
- Not at all.

336
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:01,633
So, do you have a wife?
Girlfriend?

337
00:23:01,717 --> 00:23:05,762
- I have both.
- Where are they? Shopping together?

338
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:09,266
My ex-wife...

339
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:12,728
is now in Long Island
in my ex-home...

340
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:14,730
with my ex-dog.

341
00:23:17,941 --> 00:23:23,864
There you go. My ex-girlfriend,
Jessica, is in New York,

342
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:26,992
moving out of my apartment
even as we speak.

343
00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:37,753
- Try a strawberry.
- Why?

344
00:23:37,794 --> 00:23:40,130
It brings out the flavour
in the champagne.

345
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:42,132
Oh, groovy.

346
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:52,809
Pretty good.

347
00:23:54,895 --> 00:23:57,314
- Don't you drink?
- No.

348
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:04,654
Listen, I, I appreciate this whole
seduction scene you got going,

349
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:07,366
but let me give you a tip:
I'm a sure thing. Okay?

350
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:10,577
So, I'm on an hourly rate.
Could we just move it along?

351
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:14,039
Somehow I'm sensing that this
time problem is a major issue with you.

352
00:24:14,122 --> 00:24:16,833
- Why don't we just get
through that right now?
- Great. Let's get started.

353
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:19,419
How much for the entire night?

354
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:22,964
Stay here?

355
00:24:24,716 --> 00:24:27,469
- You couldn't afford it.
- Try me.

356
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,473
- Three hundred dollars.
- Done.

357
00:24:31,556 --> 00:24:33,684
Thank you. Now we can relax.

358
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:46,822
I'll be out in just a minute.
That champagne kinda got to me.

359
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:50,659
- I didn't hear you. What did you say?
- Um, I said I'd be out in just a minute.

360
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:54,162
What is... What do you have
in, uh, your hand there?

361
00:24:54,246 --> 00:24:56,289
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

362
00:25:00,794 --> 00:25:04,214
All right, look. I do not want any
drugs here. I don't want any of this.

363
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:07,175
- Get your things and your
money and please leave.
- I don't do drugs, all right?

364
00:25:07,217 --> 00:25:10,178
- I stopped doing drugs when I was 14.
- What is this? What is this?

365
00:25:14,016 --> 00:25:16,852
- This is dental floss.
- Yeah? So?

366
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:19,855
I had all those strawberry seeds.

367
00:25:19,938 --> 00:25:21,940
And you shouldn't neglect your gums.

368
00:25:23,775 --> 00:25:26,820
- I'm sorry. Please, continue.
- Thank you.

369
00:25:34,077 --> 00:25:36,496
- Are you gonna watch?
- No, I'm going.

370
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,338
Thank you.

371
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:49,134
It's just that, uh,
very few people surprise me.

372
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:51,887
Yeah, well, you're lucky.
Most of'em shock the hell outta me.

373
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:58,393
- You're watching.
- I'm going.

374
00:26:13,742 --> 00:26:16,578
Yes, that may be true, Vance.

375
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,748
Yes, I know, but I still need
the numbers on Morse Industries.

376
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,627
Uh-huh. I've got 'em from London.

377
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:28,632
I need 'em now from Tokyo.
I'll call down and get them when
I want them. Thank you very much.

378
00:26:31,051 --> 00:26:34,930
I have a little carpet picnic here.
Are you sure you don't want a drink?

379
00:26:36,973 --> 00:26:39,768
I'm high on life.
Can't you tell?

380
00:26:50,737 --> 00:26:52,656
You know, I never saw this episode.

381
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,387
- What do you want?
- What do you do?

382
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,098
Everything.

383
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:43,100
But I don't kiss on the mouth.

384
00:28:43,183 --> 00:28:45,811
Neither do I.

385
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:49,041
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Good. Thanks.

386
00:29:49,124 --> 00:29:51,460
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Mr Thompson.

387
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:53,545
- Good morning, good morning.
- Morning, sir.

388
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:55,964
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Mr Thompson.
- Good morning, Marjorie.

389
00:29:56,048 --> 00:29:58,467
Of course Morse is going to fight.
It's to be expected.

390
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,635
He's run his company
for a very long time now.

391
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:03,347
I don't think he's ready to have
his name taken off the stationery.

392
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,682
He wants to meet you
face-to-face. Hmm?

393
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:07,476
- Okay.
- <i>I wouldn't do it.</i>

394
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:10,479
Sure you wouldn't, but do it anyhow.
Tonight, dinner. Set it up.

395
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,482
Oh, Edward, Edward. I... Look. It's
really not a good idea that you see him.

396
00:30:13,523 --> 00:30:16,651
Definitely not alone, you know?
He's a feisty old guy.

397
00:30:16,735 --> 00:30:19,404
You know, we say the wrong thing,
we could wind up in court.

398
00:30:19,488 --> 00:30:22,074
Well, you know, there's always
a possibility things are gonna go wrong.

399
00:30:22,157 --> 00:30:25,160
That's why I enjoy this so much.

400
00:30:25,243 --> 00:30:28,705
- Oh, by the way, Phil, about your car.
- Oh, God. What?

401
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:32,417
- It corners like it's on rails.
- What? What does that mean?

402
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:34,419
<i>Edward. Edward!</i>

403
00:30:36,505 --> 00:30:38,548
Hi.

404
00:30:38,632 --> 00:30:40,676
Well, good morning.

405
00:30:42,094 --> 00:30:45,013
- Red.
- Better.

406
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:50,185
You didn't wake me.
I can see you're really busy.

407
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:53,605
- I'm gonna be outta here
in just a minute.
- No, there's no hurry.

408
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:57,025
Are you hungry? You must be. Why don't
you sit and have something to eat?

409
00:31:00,362 --> 00:31:05,784
I, uh, took the liberty of
ordering everything on the menu.
I didn't know what you'd like.

410
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:09,079
- Thanks.
- All right? Good.

411
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:16,712
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah. Too good.

412
00:31:16,795 --> 00:31:20,215
- Forgot where I was.
- Occupational hazard?

413
00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:24,302
Yeah. Did you sleep?

414
00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:27,472
Uh, yes, a little, on the couch.

415
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:31,560
I was, uh, working last night.

416
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:36,398
You don't sleep, you don't do drugs,
you don't drink. You hardly eat.

417
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,193
What do you do, Edward?
'Cause I know you're not a lawyer.

418
00:31:40,235 --> 00:31:42,237
That's right.

419
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:44,489
There are four other chairs here.

420
00:31:45,574 --> 00:31:47,492
Oh.

421
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:56,501
- So what do you do?
- I buy companies.

422
00:31:56,585 --> 00:31:58,587
What kind of companies?

423
00:31:58,628 --> 00:32:03,300
Well, I buy companies that are
in financial difficulty.

424
00:32:03,383 --> 00:32:05,802
If they have problems, you must
get 'em for a bargain, huh?

425
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:08,138
Well, the company
I'm buying this week...

426
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:10,932
I'm getting for the bargain price
of about one billion.

427
00:32:13,101 --> 00:32:15,937
- A billion dollars?
- Yes.

428
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:18,523
Wow! You must be really smart, huh?

429
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:23,111
I only got through the 11 th grade.

430
00:32:24,154 --> 00:32:26,114
How far did you go in school?

431
00:32:27,157 --> 00:32:30,118
I went all the way.

432
00:32:32,412 --> 00:32:34,456
Your folks must be really proud, huh?

433
00:32:43,423 --> 00:32:46,968
So you don't actually have
a billion dollars, huh?

434
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:50,972
No, I get some of it
from banks, investors.

435
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:53,225
It's not an easy thing to do.

436
00:32:53,308 --> 00:32:55,310
- And you don't make anything?
- No.

437
00:32:55,394 --> 00:32:57,229
- And you don't build anything?
- No.

438
00:32:57,312 --> 00:33:00,023
- So what do you do with
the companies once you buy 'em?
- I sell 'em.

439
00:33:00,107 --> 00:33:02,984
Here, let me do that.
You sell them.

440
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,654
Well, I don't sell the whole company.

441
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:09,032
I break it up into pieces,
and then I sell that off.
It's worth more than the whole.

442
00:33:09,116 --> 00:33:13,912
So it's sort of like, um, stealing cars
and selling 'em for the parts, right?

443
00:33:15,997 --> 00:33:19,334
- Yeah, sort of. But legal.
- Mm-hmm.

444
00:33:19,376 --> 00:33:22,379
- There. See? Now it's perfect.
- Not bad.

445
00:33:22,462 --> 00:33:24,881
Not bad at all.
Where'd you learn to do that?

446
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:27,676
Well, I screwed the debate team
in high school.

447
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,055
I had a grandpa who was nice to me.

448
00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:34,266
He liked ties on Sundays.

449
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:37,019
Mind if I, uh, take a swim
in your tub before I go?

450
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:39,187
Not at all.
Just stay in the shallow end.

451
00:33:42,774 --> 00:33:44,651
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Edward, it's Phil.

452
00:33:44,693 --> 00:33:46,445
Listen, I'm running out the door.
I just wanna let you know.

453
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:49,698
- <i>Morse is all set for tonight.</i>
- Oh, that's good.
<i>- He's bringing his grandson.</i>

454
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:51,950
He's grooming him to take over.
I don't know.

455
00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:56,747
Ah, yes. Very intense young man
named David. Plays polo.

456
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:00,208
Look, I gotta say this again.
I don't like you going alone.

457
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,211
<i>I want your extra time and your</i>

458
00:34:03,295 --> 00:34:07,215
<i>Look. Wh... I just think</i>
<i>it'd be better if you, if you</i>
<i>went with a date, you know?</i>

459
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:09,593
<i>Keep it social.</i>

460
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:12,220
<i>- You got to know how to talk dirty, baby</i>
<i>- Edward, do you hear me?</i>

461
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:16,725
- Uh, yes. Yeah, I'm here.
- <i>What is that?</i>
- <i>If you wanna impress me</i>

462
00:34:16,808 --> 00:34:20,937
- Housekeeping is singing.
- <i>Oh, oh, oh, you can't be</i>
<i>too flirty, mama</i>

463
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:24,733
- <i>I know how to undress me</i>
- Yeah. Listen,

464
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:28,236
- <i>Edward, I know a lot of nice girls.</i>
- No, you don't.

465
00:34:28,278 --> 00:34:32,240
<i>I just want your extra time and your</i>

466
00:34:34,076 --> 00:34:36,953
- <i>Kiss</i>
- Besides, I already have one.

467
00:34:37,037 --> 00:34:41,583
- <i>If you wanna impress me</i>
- You just concentrate on
finding out what Morse is up to.

468
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:44,127
- <i>You can't be too flirty, mama</i>
- I'm on my way.

469
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:47,464
<i>I know how to undress me</i>

470
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:49,508
<i>Mm-hmm, yeah, baby</i>

471
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:53,387
<i>I wanna be your fantasy</i>

472
00:34:53,428 --> 00:34:56,306
<i>Well, maybe you could be mine</i>

473
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:02,604
<i>Mm-hmm, you just leave it</i>
<i>all up to me</i>

474
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:07,526
- Don't you just love Prince?
- More than life itself.

475
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:10,445
- Don't you knock?
- Vivian,

476
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:13,365
I have a business
proposition for you.

477
00:35:13,448 --> 00:35:15,784
- What do you want?
- I'm gonna be in town until Sunday.

478
00:35:15,826 --> 00:35:17,786
I'd like you to spend
the week with me.

479
00:35:19,788 --> 00:35:22,124
- Really?
- Yes.

480
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:25,627
Yes, I'd like to hire you
as an employee.

481
00:35:25,669 --> 00:35:27,796
Would you consider
spending the week with me?

482
00:35:29,881 --> 00:35:32,300
And I will pay you to be
at my beck and call.

483
00:35:34,136 --> 00:35:36,388
Look, I'd love to be
your beck-and-call girl,

484
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:39,016
but, um, you're a rich,
good-lookin' guy.

485
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:42,227
You could get
a million girls free.

486
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,481
I want a professional. I don't need
any romantic hassles this week.

487
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:51,737
If you're talkin' 24 hours a day,
it's gonna cost you.

488
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,990
Oh, yes, of course.

489
00:35:55,032 --> 00:35:57,576
All right. Here we go.

490
00:35:57,659 --> 00:35:59,661
Give me a ballpark figure.
How much?

491
00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:02,873
Six full nights. Days too.

492
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:08,837
- Four thousand.
- Six nights at 300 is 1,800.

493
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:11,340
- You want days too.
- Two thousand.

494
00:36:11,423 --> 00:36:14,051
- Three thousand.
- Done.

495
00:36:14,134 --> 00:36:16,053
Holy shit!

496
00:36:19,973 --> 00:36:21,892
Vivian?

497
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:23,894
Vivian, is that a yes?

498
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:29,816
Y-Y-Yes.

499
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:31,234
Yes!

500
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:34,738
I'll be gone most of the day.
I want you to buy some clothes.

501
00:36:34,821 --> 00:36:37,908
- You really should think
about traveller's cheques.
- We may be going out evenings.

502
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:40,660
- You'll need something to wear.
- Like what?

503
00:36:40,702 --> 00:36:44,039
Oh, nothing too flashy.
Not too sexy.

504
00:36:44,122 --> 00:36:47,584
- Conservative. You understand?
- Boring.

505
00:36:47,668 --> 00:36:50,379
Elegant. Any questions?

506
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:53,507
- Can I call you "Eddie"?
- Not if you expect me to answer.

507
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:55,550
I would've stayed for 2,000.

508
00:36:57,552 --> 00:37:00,430
I would've paid four.
I'll see you tonight.

509
00:37:00,514 --> 00:37:04,476
Baby, I'm gonna treat you so nice,
you're never gonna wanna let me go.

510
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:10,941
Three thousand for six days,
and, Vivian, I will let you go.

511
00:37:15,195 --> 00:37:17,155
But I'm here now.

512
00:37:29,126 --> 00:37:31,753
Three thousand dollars!

513
00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:39,428
Whoo!

514
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:48,145
- Hello.
- I called and called.
Where were you last night?

515
00:37:48,228 --> 00:37:50,272
- Ma?
- <i>It's Viv.</i>

516
00:37:50,313 --> 00:37:52,941
Oh, hi. I had to party.
Where are you?

517
00:37:52,983 --> 00:37:57,112
Oh, man, are you ready for this?
The guy? The Lotus?

518
00:37:57,154 --> 00:37:59,281
I am in his hotel room
in Beverly Hills.

519
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:02,617
The penthouse. His bathroom
is bigger than the Blue Banana.

520
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:08,040
- Do I have to hear this?
- Kit, he wants me to stay the whole week.
And you know what he's gonna give me?

521
00:38:08,123 --> 00:38:10,125
<i>Guess. You'll never guess.</i>

522
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:12,961
- <i>Three thousand dollars.</i>
- Bullshit!

523
00:38:13,003 --> 00:38:15,547
I swear to God, and extra
money to buy clothes.

524
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:19,301
Oh, man, I am bummed!
I gave that guy to you!

525
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:21,803
Three thousand. Really?
Is he twisted?

526
00:38:21,887 --> 00:38:24,890
- No.
- <i>Ugly?</i>
- He's good-looking.

527
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:26,683
- <i>Oh, what's wrong with him?</i>
- Nothing.

528
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:29,144
- Did he give you the money yet?
- <i>The end of the week.</i>

529
00:38:29,186 --> 00:38:32,606
- That's what's wrong with him.
- Well, he gave me 300 for last night,

530
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:36,193
and, Kit, I'm gonna leave some
at the front desk for you.

531
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:39,112
<i>I want you to pick it up.</i>
<i>I'm at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.</i>

532
00:38:39,154 --> 00:38:41,740
<i>Write it down. Are you writing it down?</i>
<i>You'll forget it.</i>

533
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:43,575
<i>Write it down.</i>

534
00:38:43,658 --> 00:38:48,538
- Reg... Bev... Wil.
- <i>Now, one more thing.</i>

535
00:38:48,622 --> 00:38:51,083
Where do I go for the clothes?
Good stuff. On him.

536
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:55,504
- In Beverly Hills?
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Rodeo Drive, baby.

537
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:02,302
- Hi.
- Yes, ma'am. May I help you?

538
00:39:02,344 --> 00:39:04,680
Yeah, I'm leaving this here for
Kit De Luca. She's gonna pick it up.

539
00:39:06,598 --> 00:39:09,017
- Don't open that.
- Uh, no, ma'am.

540
00:39:17,901 --> 00:39:20,153
- Miss Wilson, do you know that lady?
- No, sir.

541
00:39:21,655 --> 00:39:24,074
<i>Wild women do</i>

542
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:27,327
<i>And they don't regret it</i>

543
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:35,627
<i>Wild women show what</i>
<i>they're goin'through</i>

544
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:37,337
<i>Ooo-whoo</i>

545
00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:43,260
<i>Wild women do what you</i>
<i>think they'll never</i>

546
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:47,931
<i>What you only dream about</i>

547
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:50,225
<i>Wild women do</i>

548
00:39:51,893 --> 00:39:54,062
<i>Oh, yes, they do</i>

549
00:39:57,232 --> 00:40:00,235
<i>You tell me you want a woman who</i>

550
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:03,238
<i>Is simple as a flower</i>

551
00:40:05,157 --> 00:40:07,576
<i>Well, if you want me</i>
<i>to act like that</i>

552
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:11,079
<i>You've got to pay me by the hour</i>

553
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:15,125
<i>Wild women do</i>

554
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:18,628
<i>And they don't regret it</i>

555
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,008
<i>Oh, wild women show</i>

556
00:40:23,091 --> 00:40:25,635
<i>What they're going through</i>

557
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:28,430
<i>Ooo-whoo, yeah, ha</i>

558
00:40:28,472 --> 00:40:32,809
- <i>Wild women do what you</i>
<i>think they'll never</i>
- May I help you?

559
00:40:32,893 --> 00:40:35,854
I'm just checking things out.

560
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:38,106
Are you looking for something
in particular?

561
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:42,944
No. Well, yeah.
Um, something conservative.

562
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:44,946
Yes.

563
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:49,576
- You got nice stuff.
- Thank you.

564
00:40:49,618 --> 00:40:53,872
- How much is this?
- I don't think this would fit you.

565
00:40:53,955 --> 00:40:57,668
Well, I didn't ask if it would fit.
I asked how much it was.

566
00:40:57,751 --> 00:41:01,463
- How much is this, Marie?
- It's very expensive.

567
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:03,382
It's very expensive.

568
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:05,801
Look, I got money to spend in here.

569
00:41:05,884 --> 00:41:08,970
I don't think we have anything for you.

570
00:41:09,012 --> 00:41:13,058
You're obviously in the wrong place.
Please leave.

571
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:32,869
Doctor's office.
Two blocks down, to the left.

572
00:41:32,953 --> 00:41:34,955
You have an appointment?

573
00:41:41,378 --> 00:41:44,673
Tiffany's taking the corner space.
They'll like the project.

574
00:41:44,715 --> 00:41:46,883
I've very excited
about the whole thing.

575
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:51,263
Did you realize that Via Rodeo
is the first new street in
Beverly Hills in 75 years?

576
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:56,309
- Excuse me, miss. May I help you?
- I'm going to my room.

577
00:41:56,351 --> 00:42:00,188
- Uh, do you have a key?
- Oh, I forgot that cardboard thing.

578
00:42:00,272 --> 00:42:03,025
- I'm on the top floor.
- You're a guest here?

579
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:06,486
- I'm with a friend.
- Oh? And who would that be?

580
00:42:06,528 --> 00:42:08,488
- Edward.
- Edward?

581
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,490
Edward. Edward, uh...

582
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:14,244
- He knows me.
- Dennis.

583
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:19,041
Dennis, did you just come
off the night shift? Hmm?

584
00:42:19,124 --> 00:42:22,044
- Yes, sir.
- Do you know this young lady?

585
00:42:22,127 --> 00:42:24,212
- She's with Mr Lewis.
- Mr Lewis.

586
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:27,049
That's it. Edward Lewis.
Thanks, Dennis.

587
00:42:27,132 --> 00:42:29,551
- Evidently, she joined him last night.
- Thank you.

588
00:42:31,553 --> 00:42:34,723
Oh, God, what now? What? What?

589
00:42:34,806 --> 00:42:36,808
- What is with everybody today?
- I am the manager of the hotel.
Now just come with me.

590
00:42:36,892 --> 00:42:39,853
- We'll have a little chat.
- I'm coming. Yeah, I'm coming.
- Thank you, Dennis. Thank you.

591
00:42:39,895 --> 00:42:43,231
- And what is your name, miss?
- What do you want it to be?

592
00:42:43,273 --> 00:42:45,859
- Don't play with me, young lady.
- Vivian.

593
00:42:45,901 --> 00:42:48,070
Thank you. Vivian.

594
00:42:48,153 --> 00:42:51,323
Well, Miss Vivian,

595
00:42:51,406 --> 00:42:55,786
things that go on in other hotels don't
happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

596
00:42:55,869 --> 00:42:58,663
Now, Mr Lewis, however,
is a very special customer,

597
00:42:58,747 --> 00:43:01,666
and we'd like to think of
our special customers as friends.

598
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:06,463
Now, as a customer, we would expect Mr
Lewis to sign in any additional guests,

599
00:43:06,546 --> 00:43:08,924
but as a friend,
we're willing to overlook it.

600
00:43:09,007 --> 00:43:10,967
Now, I'm assuming that you're a...

601
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,305
relative?

602
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:18,225
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm. I thought so.

603
00:43:18,266 --> 00:43:20,811
Then you must be his...

604
00:43:22,604 --> 00:43:24,856
- Niece?
- Of course.

605
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,944
Naturally, when Mr Lewis leaves,
I won't see you in this hotel again.

606
00:43:30,821 --> 00:43:33,115
I assume you have
no other uncles here?

607
00:43:34,366 --> 00:43:36,284
Good. Then we understand
each other.

608
00:43:36,368 --> 00:43:40,455
I would also encourage you
to dress a little more appropriately.
That'll be all.

609
00:43:40,497 --> 00:43:42,457
No, that's not all.
That's what I was trying to do.

610
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:46,378
I tried to go get a dress on Rodeo Drive
today, and the women wouldn't help me.

611
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:48,922
And I have all this money now
and no dress.

612
00:43:48,964 --> 00:43:51,299
Not that I expect you to help me,
but I have all of this, okay?

613
00:43:51,383 --> 00:43:56,221
I have to buy a dress for dinner
tonight, and nobody will help me.

614
00:44:08,692 --> 00:44:10,652
Oh, man, if you are
calling the cops...

615
00:44:10,694 --> 00:44:12,821
Yeah, call the cops.
That's... That's great.

616
00:44:12,863 --> 00:44:15,490
- Tell 'em I said hi.
- Women's clothing.

617
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:18,869
Bridget, please.

618
00:44:28,045 --> 00:44:31,840
Yes, Bridget. Hello.
This is Barnard Thompson here
at the Regent Beverly Wil...

619
00:44:33,717 --> 00:44:38,180
Oh, thank you. Yes, but I'd like you
to do a favour for me, please.

620
00:44:38,221 --> 00:44:40,766
I'm sending someone over.
Her name is Vivian.

621
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:45,771
She's a special guest.
She's the niece of a very special guest.

622
00:44:48,273 --> 00:44:50,275
Now, this is the jewel
in Morse's crown.

623
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:53,779
Prime industrial property straddling
the port of Long Beach and Los Angeles.

624
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:58,700
The real estate possibilities
are endless, but most of the
yard we'll just level.

625
00:44:58,742 --> 00:45:00,619
We just got the information,
Mr Stuckey.

626
00:45:00,702 --> 00:45:04,414
Edward, we just got the Morse update.
Don, can you hold
the projection, please?

627
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:09,878
- Yeah, what? Speak.
- Old man Morse just got
the inside track...

628
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,549
on a $350 million contract
to build destroyers for the Navy.

629
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:17,344
Navy contract?
I can't believe this.

630
00:45:17,386 --> 00:45:20,347
I thought you said they had
nothing in the hopper on this one!

631
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:23,141
- I thought they didn't.
- Hey, you know, if that's true,
it could cost a lot more.

632
00:45:23,225 --> 00:45:26,186
- Those stocks could go through the roof.
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock!

633
00:45:26,228 --> 00:45:28,939
Maybe we're lucky to get
this information now, sir.

634
00:45:29,022 --> 00:45:30,941
- See, we can still walk away from it.
- "Walk away"?

635
00:45:31,024 --> 00:45:33,694
Hey, forget it, pal.
We got a thousand man-hours in on this.

636
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:36,029
- Nobody's walking away from anything.
- Philip, I think he's right.

637
00:45:36,071 --> 00:45:38,031
- Forget it, Mark.
- I do too, but why is he...
- I don't wanna hear it! Well, at least you're...

638
00:45:38,073 --> 00:45:40,701
Gentlemen, relax. Relax.

639
00:45:40,742 --> 00:45:43,912
Who do we know on the Senate
Appropriations Committee?

640
00:45:43,995 --> 00:45:47,082
- Senator Adams.
- All right, Senator Adams.
Let's find out where he is.

641
00:45:47,165 --> 00:45:51,420
The Navy's not going to spend
$350 million on anything without
going to Appropriations first.

642
00:45:51,461 --> 00:45:53,922
I don't understand what's
going on here today, gentlemen.

643
00:45:54,006 --> 00:45:57,092
- Hello?
- Well, that's why I hired you, Phil...
to do my worrying for me.

644
00:45:57,175 --> 00:45:59,928
I'll be in your office. Bob, if you
want to send over the geologicals.

645
00:46:00,012 --> 00:46:02,097
- No problem.
- Thank you.
- Edward.

646
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,851
- Listen. Everything all set
for the meeting tonight?
- Yes, Senator Adams, please.

647
00:46:05,934 --> 00:46:08,103
- Well, who, who is this girl
you're goin' with?
- Yes?

648
00:46:09,771 --> 00:46:13,567
- Nobody you know.
- Yes, Edward Lewis Enterprises.

649
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:16,028
Phil Stuckey.
Yes, I have him right here.

650
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:19,197
Don't worry, Mrs Rainey.
I'll call you the minute it comes in.

651
00:46:19,281 --> 00:46:21,366
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

652
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:31,043
- Hello. You must be Vivian.
My name's Bridget.
- Yeah, hi.

653
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:34,796
- Barney said you'd be nice to me.
- He's very sweet.

654
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,466
What are your plans
while you're in town?

655
00:46:37,507 --> 00:46:39,801
- We're gonna have dinner.
- Oh, don't sit up there. Here.
- Oh.

656
00:46:39,843 --> 00:46:42,262
- You're gonna go out? Dinner?
- Mm-hmm.

657
00:46:42,304 --> 00:46:45,223
Well, you'll need a cocktail dress then.
Come with me.

658
00:46:45,307 --> 00:46:48,435
Now, I'm sure we're gonna find something
here that your uncle would love.

659
00:46:48,477 --> 00:46:52,147
- You're a size six, right?
- Yeah. How'd you know that?

660
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,567
- Well, that's my job.
- Bridge, he's not really my uncle.

661
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,819
They never are, dear.

662
00:47:01,907 --> 00:47:04,493
Barney. Sorry, mister.

663
00:47:04,576 --> 00:47:07,329
- I got a dress.
- Well, I'd rather hoped
you'd be wearing it.

664
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:09,831
Oh, no. I didn't wanna get it messed up.
Listen, I got shoes too. You wanna see?

665
00:47:09,915 --> 00:47:12,584
No, that won't be necessary. I'm sure
they're quite lovely. Thank you.

666
00:47:12,668 --> 00:47:15,128
Okay, well, listen.
I didn't mean to interrupt you,
but Bridget was really great,

667
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,130
and I just wanted to say thanks.

668
00:47:17,172 --> 00:47:19,216
- You're cool.
- You're welcome, Miss Vivian.

669
00:47:26,848 --> 00:47:29,685
- Hello.
- Never ever pick up the phone.

670
00:47:29,768 --> 00:47:33,146
- Then why are you calling me?
- <i>Did you buy clothes today?</i>

671
00:47:33,188 --> 00:47:35,565
- I got a dress. A cocktail one.
<i>- That's good.</i>

672
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:38,485
I'll be in the hotel lobby
7:45 sharp.

673
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:41,863
<i>- What, you're not comin'up to the door?</i>
- This isn't a date. It's business.

674
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:46,118
- Where are you takin' me, anyway?
- I'm taking you to a restaurant
called the Voltaire.

675
00:47:46,201 --> 00:47:48,829
- <i>Very elegant.</i>
- All right.

676
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:51,707
I'll meet you in the lobby,
but only 'cause you're payin' me to.

677
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:54,084
Well, thank you very much.

678
00:47:56,461 --> 00:47:59,715
Get her back for me, please.

679
00:47:59,798 --> 00:48:03,802
- Mr Stuckey wanted to see you.
- Yes, tell him I'm in the middle
of a very important phone call.

680
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,224
- Hello.
- I told you not to pick up the phone.

681
00:48:09,307 --> 00:48:11,268
Then stop callin' me.

682
00:48:14,604 --> 00:48:15,939
Sick.

683
00:48:17,649 --> 00:48:19,735
Barney...

684
00:48:19,818 --> 00:48:22,571
- It didn't fit.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

685
00:48:22,654 --> 00:48:25,115
Uh, I've got a little problem.

686
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:27,325
All right, Miss Vivian.
One more time.

687
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:31,538
- Dinner napkin.
- Dinner napkin, lay gently in the lap.

688
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,083
Good. Elbows off the table.
Don't slouch.

689
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:41,798
Shrimp fork, salad fork, dinner fork.

690
00:48:41,882 --> 00:48:45,969
I definitely have the salad fork.
The rest of the silverware
is a little confusing.

691
00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:48,597
All right. If you get nervous,
just count the tines.

692
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,766
Now four tines: dinner fork.

693
00:48:50,807 --> 00:48:54,644
And sometimes there are
three tines: the salad fork.

694
00:48:54,728 --> 00:48:56,146
And sometimes...

695
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:12,662
Pardon me, Mr Lewis. I'm Mr Thompson.
I'm the manager of the hotel.

696
00:49:12,746 --> 00:49:14,664
Uh-huh. Excuse me.
I just wanna make one call.

697
00:49:14,748 --> 00:49:16,875
Yes, I'm sorry.
I have a message for you, sir.

698
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:19,836
- From who?
- From your niece, sir.

699
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,340
- My what?
- The young lady's who's staying
with you in your room, sir.

700
00:49:24,424 --> 00:49:27,344
Oh. Hmm.

701
00:49:27,427 --> 00:49:30,305
- I think we both know
that she's not my niece.
- Of course, sir.

702
00:49:30,389 --> 00:49:33,600
The reason I know that
is that I am an only child.

703
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:36,269
- Yes, sir.
- What's the message?

704
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:39,356
She's waiting for you in the lounge.

705
00:49:39,439 --> 00:49:41,441
Intriguing young lady, Miss Vivian.

706
00:49:42,984 --> 00:49:44,945
- Intriguing.
- Have a good evening, sir.

707
00:49:46,738 --> 00:49:49,324
- Thank you, Mr...
- Thompson. I'm the...
- Thompson.

708
00:49:49,408 --> 00:49:52,160
manager... manager
of the hotel, sir.

709
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,450
- You're late.
- You're stunning.

710
00:50:32,826 --> 00:50:34,745
You're forgiven.

711
00:50:36,747 --> 00:50:38,707
Shall we go to dinner?

712
00:50:51,345 --> 00:50:55,307
- This way, Mr Lewis.
Your party's waiting.
- Stop fidgeting.

713
00:50:58,685 --> 00:51:02,314
- Mr Morse.
- Yes. Mr Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.

714
00:51:02,397 --> 00:51:06,902
This fireball is my grandson, David.

715
00:51:06,985 --> 00:51:10,238
Yeah, well, I don't know
about the fireball part,
but grandson's true enough.

716
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,783
Well, I'm pleased to meet you both.
This is a friend of mine, Vivian Ward.

717
00:51:12,866 --> 00:51:15,285
- Hi. Really glad to meet you.
- Mr Morse, David.

718
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:17,287
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Please sit.

719
00:51:23,835 --> 00:51:25,754
Excuse me.

720
00:51:27,631 --> 00:51:31,259
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the ladies' room.

721
00:51:33,428 --> 00:51:37,391
- Upstairs, to the right.
- Okay. Excuse me.

722
00:51:37,432 --> 00:51:39,393
- Shall I order for you?
- Yeah.

723
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:44,398
- Please do so. Thank you.
- I'll do that.

724
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:54,658
Mr Lewis,
my grandfather believes...

725
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:57,285
the men who create a company
should control its destiny.

726
00:51:57,369 --> 00:51:59,955
Where's the salad?

727
00:51:59,996 --> 00:52:04,376
- Oh, the salad comes
at the end of the meal.
- But that's the fork I knew.

728
00:52:07,045 --> 00:52:09,089
Let me, uh, put it another way.

729
00:52:09,131 --> 00:52:12,467
Between your public statements and
the rumours flying around on this thing,

730
00:52:12,551 --> 00:52:15,345
we find it very hard to figure out
what your real intentions are.

731
00:52:15,429 --> 00:52:19,141
I don't know about you,
but I've never been able
to figure which goes with what.

732
00:52:35,449 --> 00:52:38,577
You know, there was a time
when we built ships the size of cities.

733
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,704
Men like my grandfather
made this country.

734
00:52:40,787 --> 00:52:43,915
- Who ordered this?
- The gentleman did, ma'am. <i>Bon appétit.</i>

735
00:52:43,999 --> 00:52:48,337
These are escargot. It's French
for snails. It's a delicacy. Try it.

736
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,008
- David.
- Mr Lewis, if you were to get control...

737
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:55,844
and I don't think you will...
but if you did,

738
00:52:55,886 --> 00:52:58,013
what do you plan to do
with the company?

739
00:52:58,096 --> 00:53:00,849
Break it up and sell off
the pieces.

740
00:53:00,932 --> 00:53:03,393
I'm sure you understand
I'm not thrilled at the idea...

741
00:53:03,477 --> 00:53:07,731
of your turning 40 years of
my work into your garage sale.

742
00:53:07,814 --> 00:53:12,027
At the price I'm paying
for this stock, Mr Morse,
you are going to be a very rich man.

743
00:53:12,069 --> 00:53:15,530
I'm rich enough.
I just wanna have my shipyard.

744
00:53:19,242 --> 00:53:22,954
Slippery little suckers.

745
00:53:23,038 --> 00:53:24,790
It happens all the time.

746
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:31,171
I met your father. What's his name?

747
00:53:31,213 --> 00:53:35,050
- Carter.
- Yeah. Carter. Carter Lewis.

748
00:53:35,133 --> 00:53:37,386
He's not quite the bastard
everybody says he is.

749
00:53:37,427 --> 00:53:41,056
- No, I have the franchise on that.
- Does that make him proud?

750
00:53:41,139 --> 00:53:43,600
I doubt it.

751
00:53:43,684 --> 00:53:46,937
It doesn't really matter now.
He passed away.

752
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,607
- I hadn't heard. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

753
00:53:50,691 --> 00:53:54,403
Mr Morse, you asked for this meeting.
What can I do for you?

754
00:53:54,486 --> 00:53:59,616
- Leave my company alone!
- I can't do that.
I own ten million shares.

755
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,411
- I'll buy your stock back.
- You don't have the money.

756
00:54:02,494 --> 00:54:05,080
We will. We're getting a contract
to build ten destroyers.

757
00:54:05,163 --> 00:54:09,751
There will be no contract. The contract
is now buried in Appropriations
Committee and it will remain there.

758
00:54:09,876 --> 00:54:12,337
And how the hell do you pull something
like that? What, you got a...

759
00:54:12,379 --> 00:54:15,173
- You got dirty politicians
in your pockets now or something?
- Easy, easy, easy.

760
00:54:15,215 --> 00:54:20,929
- Calm down. Calm down, David.
Mr Lewis plays hardball.
- Yes. Yes, I do.

761
00:54:21,013 --> 00:54:24,558
I've heard enough of this. Vivian,
it was a great pleasure to meet you.

762
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:28,562
I'm sorry, Grandfather.
I've got to get some air. Mr Lewis.

763
00:54:28,603 --> 00:54:31,023
I better join my grandson.

764
00:54:31,064 --> 00:54:35,485
You two enjoy your dinner. I'm sure
it'll be delicious. Good luck, miss.

765
00:54:36,903 --> 00:54:39,990
Watch out, Lewis.
I'm gonna tear you apart.

766
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,410
I look forward to it, sir.

767
00:54:53,795 --> 00:54:56,006
Edward?

768
00:54:57,591 --> 00:54:59,593
Edward, you said
you never come out here.

769
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:04,848
Well, I'm only halfway out.

770
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:07,601
You didn't say much in the car
on the way home.

771
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:11,271
You thinking about dinner?
I was a maniac.

772
00:55:11,396 --> 00:55:14,983
I mean, the business was good,
I think, you know?

773
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:18,779
He's in trouble.
You want his company.

774
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,866
- He doesn't wanna let it go.
- Thanks for the recap.

775
00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:26,703
Problem is, I think
you like Mr Morse.

776
00:55:26,787 --> 00:55:29,122
What I would like is
for you to get down from there.
You're making me very nervous.

777
00:55:29,164 --> 00:55:31,666
- Please, come down.
- It's making you nervous?

778
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:33,752
What if I just lean back
a little bit like this?

779
00:55:33,835 --> 00:55:36,421
- Would you...
Would you rescue me if I fell?
- Vivian, I'm serious.

780
00:55:36,505 --> 00:55:40,133
- Come... I'm not looking.
- It's really high. Look.
No hands. No hands!

781
00:55:40,175 --> 00:55:42,678
Okay. All right. I'm sorry.

782
00:55:44,012 --> 00:55:46,264
The truth is,

783
00:55:46,348 --> 00:55:49,476
it really is totally irrelevant
whether I like this man or not.

784
00:55:49,518 --> 00:55:52,938
I will not let myself become
emotionally involved in business.

785
00:55:54,272 --> 00:55:57,734
I know.
Kit's always saying to me,

786
00:55:57,818 --> 00:56:00,028
"Don't get emotional
when you turn tricks."

787
00:56:00,112 --> 00:56:02,864
That's why no kissing.
It's too personal.

788
00:56:02,948 --> 00:56:06,410
It's like what you're saying.
You stay numb, you don't get involved.

789
00:56:06,493 --> 00:56:09,162
When I'm with a guy,
I'm like a robot. I just do it.

790
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,172
- Well, I mean, except with you.
- Of course not with me.

791
00:56:21,466 --> 00:56:25,512
You and I are
such similar creatures, Vivian.

792
00:56:25,554 --> 00:56:27,806
We both screw people for money.

793
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:37,232
I was sorry to hear
about your dad.

794
00:56:37,315 --> 00:56:39,651
- When did he die?
- Last month.

795
00:56:42,487 --> 00:56:45,657
Do you miss him?

796
00:56:45,741 --> 00:56:48,535
I hadn't spoken to him
in 14 and a half years.

797
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,581
I wasn't there when he died.

798
00:56:54,499 --> 00:56:56,668
- Do you wanna talk about this?
- No.

799
00:56:56,752 --> 00:56:59,421
Well, I'll tell ya what.
'Cause I got an idea.

800
00:57:01,048 --> 00:57:03,759
Let's watch old movies all night.

801
00:57:03,842 --> 00:57:06,303
We'll just veg out
in front of the TV.

802
00:57:06,386 --> 00:57:11,224
- Veg out?
- Yeah. Be still like vegetables.
Lay like broccoli.

803
00:57:13,935 --> 00:57:17,773
Look, I'll tell you what. I'll be back.
We'll do broccoli tomorrow.

804
00:57:20,442 --> 00:57:23,111
- Where are you going?
- I'm going downstairs for a while.

805
00:57:26,073 --> 00:57:29,076
<i>- Did you say "marriage licence"?</i>
<i>- Now don't change the subject.</i>

806
00:57:29,117 --> 00:57:31,078
<i>- Just give me the stand.</i>
<i>- Ohhh!</i>

807
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:36,625
<i>Oh, I love you, Adam Alex Bider Bryan,</i>
<i>whatever your name is!</i>

808
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:38,627
<i>Oh, I love you.</i>

809
00:57:50,681 --> 00:57:54,935
Hi, uh, I'm in the penthouse.
The guy that was here, Mr Lewis?

810
00:57:54,976 --> 00:57:56,937
Have you seen him
down there anywhere?

811
00:58:37,769 --> 00:58:40,313
Thank you. Thank you very much.

812
00:58:40,397 --> 00:58:45,610
- I didn't know you played.
- I only play for strangers.

813
00:58:45,652 --> 00:58:48,196
I was getting lonely upstairs
all by myself.

814
00:58:53,744 --> 00:58:57,831
Gentlemen, would you mind
leaving us, please?

815
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:02,711
Thank you.

816
00:59:05,088 --> 00:59:07,799
People always do
what you tell them to do?

817
00:59:38,997 --> 00:59:41,249
I guess so.

818
01:00:40,475 --> 01:00:42,561
Wake up. Time to shop.

819
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:49,401
Now, if you have any trouble
using this card, have 'em call
the hotel. All right?

820
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:54,281
- Oh, more shopping.
- Mm-hmm.

821
01:00:56,033 --> 01:00:58,577
I'm surprised you didn't buy
more than one dress yesterday.

822
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,330
It wasn't as much fun
as I thought it was gonna be.

823
01:01:02,414 --> 01:01:05,083
- Why not?
- They were mean to me.

824
01:01:06,752 --> 01:01:09,046
Mean to you?

825
01:01:11,673 --> 01:01:15,969
- People are looking at me.
- They're not looking at you.
They're looking at me.

826
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:18,513
The stores are not nice to people.
I don't like it.

827
01:01:18,597 --> 01:01:21,516
Stores are never nice to people.
They're nice to credit cards.

828
01:01:23,435 --> 01:01:25,354
Okay. Stop fidgeting.

829
01:01:25,437 --> 01:01:27,356
- All right.
- Get rid of your gum.

830
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,818
I don't believe you did that.

831
01:01:34,237 --> 01:01:37,949
- Yes?
- I am Mr Hollister, the manager.
May I help you?

832
01:01:38,033 --> 01:01:40,410
- Edward Lewis.
- Ah. Yes, sir.

833
01:01:40,452 --> 01:01:43,997
- You see this young lady over here?
- Yes.

834
01:01:44,081 --> 01:01:46,583
Do you have anything in this shop
as beautiful as she is?

835
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:49,336
Oh, yes. Oh, no.

836
01:01:49,419 --> 01:01:54,132
No, no, no. I'm saying we have
many things as beautiful
as she would want them to be.

837
01:01:54,174 --> 01:01:57,010
That's the point I was getting at,
and I think we can all agree with that.

838
01:01:57,094 --> 01:01:59,471
- That's why when you came in here,
you knew from the first...
- Excuse me. You know what we're gonna need here?

839
01:01:59,513 --> 01:02:03,016
We're gonna need a few more people
helping us out. I'll tell you why.

840
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:06,978
We are going to be spending
an obscene amount of money in here.

841
01:02:07,062 --> 01:02:10,065
So we're gonna need a lot more help
sucking up to us, 'cause that's
what we really like.

842
01:02:10,148 --> 01:02:12,109
- You understand me.
- Oh. Sir, if I may say so,

843
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:14,569
you're in the right store,
and the right city, for that matter.

844
01:02:14,653 --> 01:02:16,571
Anything you see here,
we can do, by the way.

845
01:02:16,655 --> 01:02:18,323
- Get ready to have some fun, okay?
- Okay.

846
01:02:18,365 --> 01:02:20,951
Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary Francis,
Tovah. Let's see it. Come on.

847
01:02:20,992 --> 01:02:22,953
- Pick it up, girls.
- Oh, this is absolutely divine!
- You're doing great, but you...

848
01:02:22,994 --> 01:02:24,705
- Excuse me, sir. Uh...
- Yeah.

849
01:02:24,788 --> 01:02:28,333
Exactly how obscene an amount
of money were you talking about?

850
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:31,169
Just profane or really offensive?

851
01:02:31,211 --> 01:02:33,672
- Really offensive.
- I like him so much.

852
01:02:51,106 --> 01:02:54,109
Mr Lewis, sir? Mr Lewis? How's it
going so far? Pretty well, I think.

853
01:02:54,192 --> 01:02:57,654
- I think we need some major sucking up.
- You should just see you!

854
01:02:57,696 --> 01:03:01,533
Very well, sir. You're not only
handsome, but a powerful man.

855
01:03:01,575 --> 01:03:04,369
I could see the second you walked in
here you were someone to reckon with...

856
01:03:04,453 --> 01:03:06,246
- Hollister.
- Yes, sir.

857
01:03:06,329 --> 01:03:08,665
Not me. Her.

858
01:03:08,707 --> 01:03:12,586
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
How are we doing, ladies?

859
01:03:12,669 --> 01:03:15,797
Oh, Edward, Edward. Where the hell
are you? The word's all over the street.

860
01:03:15,881 --> 01:03:20,927
- <i>Morse is gonna raise your offer, pal.</i>
- He's countering?
God, he is a tough old bird.

861
01:03:21,011 --> 01:03:23,638
<i>He knows the Navy contracts are stalled.</i>
<i>Where's he gonna get the money?</i>

862
01:03:23,722 --> 01:03:26,141
I don't know. He... I think
he's throwing in with the employees.

863
01:03:26,224 --> 01:03:28,602
He still needs someone
to underwrite the paper.

864
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:31,521
<i>- Find out who it is.</i>
<i>I'll be in the office in an hour.</i>
- Yeah, okay. You got it.

865
01:03:31,563 --> 01:03:35,692
You're on your own. I have to go
back to work. You look great.

866
01:03:35,734 --> 01:03:38,570
- She has my card.
- And we'll help her use it, sir!

867
01:03:41,907 --> 01:03:45,285
<i>Pretty woman</i>
<i>walkin'down the street</i>

868
01:03:45,369 --> 01:03:49,247
<i>Pretty woman</i>
<i>the kind I like to meet</i>

869
01:03:49,331 --> 01:03:51,875
<i>Pretty woman</i>

870
01:03:51,917 --> 01:03:56,129
<i>I don't believe you</i>
<i>You're not the truth</i>

871
01:03:56,213 --> 01:04:00,175
<i>No one could look</i>
<i>as good as you</i>

872
01:04:00,258 --> 01:04:02,427
<i>Mercy</i>

873
01:04:05,972 --> 01:04:08,266
- Edward would love that tie.
- Would you give her the tie?

874
01:04:08,308 --> 01:04:09,976
- The tie?
- Take off the tie. Give her the tie.

875
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:11,436
- Oh, the tie.
- He really wants to do this.

876
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,105
- He would go crazy about this tie.
- Give her the tie.

877
01:04:13,146 --> 01:04:14,898
- He really would.
- Who ordered pizza?

878
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:18,443
<i>Pretty woman, stop a while</i>

879
01:04:18,527 --> 01:04:22,197
<i>Pretty woman, talk a while</i>

880
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:27,619
<i>Pretty woman,</i>
<i>give your smile to me</i>

881
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:33,458
<i>Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

882
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:37,129
<i>Pretty woman, look my way</i>

883
01:04:37,212 --> 01:04:41,049
- <i>Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me</i>
- May I help you?
- No, thank you.

884
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:43,593
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Do you remember me?

885
01:04:43,635 --> 01:04:47,222
- No, I'm sorry.
- I was in here yesterday.
You wouldn't wait on me.

886
01:04:47,305 --> 01:04:49,808
- Oh.
- You work on commission, right?

887
01:04:49,891 --> 01:04:53,145
- Uh, yes.
- Big mistake.

888
01:04:53,228 --> 01:04:56,273
Big. Huge.
I have to go shopping now.

889
01:04:58,275 --> 01:05:01,820
<i>Pretty woman,</i>
<i>don't walk on by</i>

890
01:05:01,862 --> 01:05:05,657
<i>Pretty woman,</i>
<i>don't make me cry</i>

891
01:05:05,741 --> 01:05:08,368
<i>Pretty woman</i>

892
01:05:08,452 --> 01:05:13,081
<i>Don't walk away, hey</i>

893
01:05:15,334 --> 01:05:17,461
Oh. Thank you.

894
01:05:18,545 --> 01:05:23,633
<i>Oh, oh, pretty woman</i>

895
01:05:23,675 --> 01:05:24,384
...just where it is.
- Mr Lewis.

896
01:05:24,426 --> 01:05:25,427
- Gentlemen.
- Let's see that...

897
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:27,679
Fellas, let's finish this up
this afternoon, huh?

898
01:05:27,763 --> 01:05:32,684
Jake, set something up with Blair.
About, uh, 2:00, 2:30 would be good.

899
01:05:32,726 --> 01:05:36,313
You were right about Morse.
He mortgaged everything he owns
right down to his underwear...

900
01:05:36,355 --> 01:05:38,523
to secure a loan from the bank.

901
01:05:38,607 --> 01:05:41,318
It's not just any bank.
Plymouth Trust, huh?

902
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,904
- Hmm.
- So it goes without saying...

903
01:05:43,987 --> 01:05:46,198
that your business means a lot more
to them than our friend Mr Morse.

904
01:05:46,281 --> 01:05:48,784
So all you gotta do is call the bank.

905
01:05:52,871 --> 01:05:54,164
Yeah.

906
01:05:58,752 --> 01:06:03,048
Edward, excuse me for saying this,
but what the hell is
wrong with you this week?

907
01:06:03,131 --> 01:06:05,092
Are you giving Morse
a chance to get away?

908
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:08,887
You know what I used to love
when I was a kid, Phil?

909
01:06:11,723 --> 01:06:14,685
- What?
- Blocks.

910
01:06:17,479 --> 01:06:19,731
Building blocks. Erector sets.

911
01:06:19,773 --> 01:06:22,693
So I liked Monopoly. Huh?
Boardwalk, Park Place.

912
01:06:22,734 --> 01:06:26,905
- Well, wh... what's the point?
- We don't build anything, Phil.
We don't make anything.

913
01:06:28,448 --> 01:06:30,742
We make money, Edward.

914
01:06:30,784 --> 01:06:36,415
We worked for a year on this deal.
It's what you said you wanted.
I'm handing it to you.

915
01:06:36,456 --> 01:06:40,377
Morse's jugular is exposed.
It's time for the kill.

916
01:06:40,419 --> 01:06:43,880
Let's finish this. Call the bank.

917
01:07:05,819 --> 01:07:07,779
How was your day, dear?

918
01:07:11,283 --> 01:07:13,452
Nice tie.

919
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,495
I got it for you.

920
01:07:17,831 --> 01:07:20,959
Well, my mother was a music teacher,

921
01:07:21,001 --> 01:07:25,297
and married my father,
whose family was extremely wealthy.

922
01:07:25,339 --> 01:07:27,966
Then he divorced my mother
to be with another woman,

923
01:07:29,426 --> 01:07:31,345
and he took his money with him.

924
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,517
And then she died.
I was very angry with him.

925
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:40,437
It cost me $ 10,000 in therapy
to say that sentence.

926
01:07:40,479 --> 01:07:42,481
"I was very angry with him."

927
01:07:42,522 --> 01:07:45,275
I do it very well, don't I? I'll say it
again. I was very angry with him.

928
01:07:45,317 --> 01:07:48,862
Hello, my name is Mr Lewis.
I'm very angry with my father.

929
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:50,906
I would've been angry
at the $ 10,000.

930
01:07:52,908 --> 01:07:58,080
My father was president of
the third company I ever took over.

931
01:08:00,165 --> 01:08:04,002
I bought it.
I sold it off, piece by piece.

932
01:08:04,086 --> 01:08:08,006
- What'd the shrink say?
- Said I was cured.

933
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:11,009
Well, so, you got even.
That must've made you happy.

934
01:08:17,015 --> 01:08:21,186
Did I mention my leg
is 44 inches from hip to toe?

935
01:08:21,228 --> 01:08:23,855
So basically we're talkin' about...

936
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:27,317
88 inches of therapy...

937
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,362
wrapped around you
for the bargain price of...

938
01:08:30,404 --> 01:08:33,532
- $3,000.
- $3,000.
- Yeah.

939
01:08:38,203 --> 01:08:40,455
<i>Ebersol of the Falcons</i>
<i>passes to Keenan.</i>

940
01:08:40,539 --> 01:08:44,501
<i>This is Bill Fricker with Gwen Olsen</i>
<i>giving you play-by-play</i>
<i>of this marvellous charity event.</i>

941
01:08:44,543 --> 01:08:48,505
Watch where you're walking,
because if you step in something,
we're not going back in the car.

942
01:08:48,547 --> 01:08:51,049
Not too near the tree.
I don't like the ants. Hello!

943
01:08:51,091 --> 01:08:53,510
- Hello! How are you?
- Have you seen Edward anywhere?

944
01:08:53,552 --> 01:08:56,263
- What if someone recognizes me?
- Not likely.

945
01:08:56,346 --> 01:08:58,890
- They don't spend too much time
on Hollywood Boulevard.
- You did.

946
01:08:58,974 --> 01:09:01,309
Come on. Let go. Let go.

947
01:09:01,393 --> 01:09:04,813
All right. You look great.
You look like a lady.

948
01:09:04,896 --> 01:09:07,232
You're gonna have a wonderful time.

949
01:09:08,275 --> 01:09:10,235
Okay, don't fidget and smile.

950
01:09:11,528 --> 01:09:13,071
<i>Humboldt's coming</i>
<i>around from the side.</i>

951
01:09:13,113 --> 01:09:16,366
<i>Toquenee is on Keenan.</i>
<i>Penalty on that play.</i>

952
01:09:16,408 --> 01:09:19,703
This is Gwen and Gretchen,
the infamous Olsen sisters...

953
01:09:19,745 --> 01:09:22,247
who have made marrying well
an art form.

954
01:09:22,289 --> 01:09:24,499
- Edward!
- Be back in just a second. Hold on.

955
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:27,461
So, you're the flavour
of the month, hmm?

956
01:09:27,544 --> 01:09:31,715
Uh, she's just being testy.
Edward's our most eligible bachelor.

957
01:09:31,757 --> 01:09:34,593
- Everybody is trying to land him.
- Well, I'm not trying to land him.

958
01:09:34,634 --> 01:09:36,595
I'm just using him for sex.

959
01:09:37,763 --> 01:09:38,722
Oh!

960
01:09:38,764 --> 01:09:41,600
Go on!

961
01:09:41,641 --> 01:09:45,354
- Well done.
- Well done! Woof! Woof! Woof!

962
01:09:48,023 --> 01:09:50,025
Tell me again why we're here.

963
01:09:50,108 --> 01:09:52,444
- Business.
- Business mingling?

964
01:09:52,486 --> 01:09:54,821
Yeah.

965
01:09:54,905 --> 01:09:56,865
<i>That's the chukker,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

966
01:09:56,948 --> 01:09:59,034
<i>Falcons, 7, Gems, 4.</i>

967
01:09:59,117 --> 01:10:02,788
Excuse me. Edward.
Edward. Over here.

968
01:10:02,829 --> 01:10:04,915
- Phil.
- Ah, it's good to see you.

969
01:10:04,956 --> 01:10:07,167
You too. I want you to meet
a new friend of mine, Vivian Ward.

970
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:10,212
Well, hi. Philip Stuckey, Vivian.
This is my wife, Elizabeth.

971
01:10:10,295 --> 01:10:13,215
It's always a pleasure
meeting one of Edward's girls.

972
01:10:13,298 --> 01:10:15,717
Oh, my God!
It's Tate Whitley Wallington!

973
01:10:15,801 --> 01:10:20,305
Tate! It's me,
Elizabeth from Workout World!

974
01:10:20,347 --> 01:10:22,641
She's an aerobics queen.

975
01:10:22,683 --> 01:10:25,560
Feel the burn. Well, hey,
let me get you something to drink.

976
01:10:25,644 --> 01:10:27,646
- Eli... Vivian, why don't
you start with that, okay?
- Thank you.

977
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:30,023
I'll be right back. By the way,
did you notice Senator Adams is here?

978
01:10:30,107 --> 01:10:32,401
Mm-hmm. I asked him.

979
01:10:32,484 --> 01:10:35,487
That is why I have pledged
my eternal love to you. Mmph!

980
01:10:37,114 --> 01:10:39,116
Real genuine guy. Who is he?

981
01:10:40,534 --> 01:10:42,661
He's my lawyer. He's all right.

982
01:10:42,703 --> 01:10:44,788
You could freeze ice
on his wife's ass.

983
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:48,667
- Maybe we'll try that later.
- Are these people your friends?

984
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:52,337
- I spend time with them, yeah.
- Well, no wonder.

985
01:10:52,379 --> 01:10:55,549
- No wonder what?
- No wonder why
you came looking for me.

986
01:10:57,509 --> 01:11:00,345
<i>And I do need some help from you</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen in the audience.</i>

987
01:11:00,387 --> 01:11:03,724
<i>We need you to help us replace some</i>
<i>of the divots out here on the grass.</i>

988
01:11:03,807 --> 01:11:07,352
<i>- So come on out now.</i>
<i>- Come on! Come on, folks.</i>

989
01:11:07,436 --> 01:11:09,604
<i>You heard her.</i>
<i>The stomping of the divots.</i>

990
01:11:09,688 --> 01:11:12,315
<i>This is a time-honoured tradition,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

991
01:11:12,357 --> 01:11:14,901
<i>As old as the game</i>
<i>of polo itself.</i>

992
01:11:14,985 --> 01:11:17,195
<i>Kings and queens</i>
<i>used to do this.</i>

993
01:11:19,781 --> 01:11:23,577
She's sweet, Edward.
Wherever did you find her?

994
01:11:24,578 --> 01:11:26,538
976-BABE.

995
01:11:28,915 --> 01:11:30,959
<i>Only one word of advice.</i>

996
01:11:31,043 --> 01:11:33,920
<i>Avoid the steaming divot.</i>

997
01:11:40,927 --> 01:11:43,055
No, it's all part
of the game of polo.

998
01:11:43,138 --> 01:11:45,599
You get to have your shoes polished
by a member of the club.

999
01:11:45,682 --> 01:11:47,601
Think I've got something
in the car that'll buff that up.

1000
01:11:47,684 --> 01:11:49,561
Thank you.

1001
01:11:49,603 --> 01:11:52,898
- Vivian. Hi. David Morse.
- Excuse me.

1002
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:56,360
- David.
- How are you?

1003
01:11:56,401 --> 01:11:59,363
- I'm okay.
- I thought that was you.
I like this hat.

1004
01:11:59,404 --> 01:12:01,907
- It's new.
- Yeah? It's nice.
- Yeah. Thanks.

1005
01:12:01,948 --> 01:12:04,534
- Come meet my horse, Vivian.
- Well, Edward's waiting for me.
I don't wanna...

1006
01:12:04,576 --> 01:12:08,205
- Well, come on. He's right here.
- Okay, I'll...
Just for a second, though.

1007
01:12:08,246 --> 01:12:10,791
I didn't know
you were playing today.

1008
01:12:10,874 --> 01:12:13,418
Uh, I was asking for directions.
There she was.

1009
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:16,213
Oh, so you just ran into her?
That's great. Jesus.

1010
01:12:16,254 --> 01:12:18,256
So, then, what does she do?
She... Does she work?

1011
01:12:20,634 --> 01:12:22,844
- She's in sales.
- Sales? That's terrific.

1012
01:12:22,928 --> 01:12:24,805
That's good. What does she sell?

1013
01:12:27,182 --> 01:12:30,769
Why do you wanna know?

1014
01:12:30,852 --> 01:12:34,481
Now just hear me out on this, okay?
I've known you a long time, you know.

1015
01:12:34,564 --> 01:12:38,610
I, uh, I see some differences in you
this week, like the tie and, uh...

1016
01:12:38,694 --> 01:12:41,029
I'm wondering if maybe this girl
isn't the difference.

1017
01:12:41,113 --> 01:12:43,407
Especially when I see her
talking to David Morse.

1018
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,580
I introduced them
at dinner the other night.

1019
01:12:50,622 --> 01:12:53,792
So, what? Now they're best friends?
I mean, this girl appears
from out of nowhere.

1020
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:55,669
Now she's talkin' to a guy
whose company we're tryin' to buy.

1021
01:12:55,752 --> 01:12:57,170
- That's a little convenient,
don't you think?
- I don't believe this.

1022
01:12:57,254 --> 01:12:58,964
Edward, how...

1023
01:12:59,006 --> 01:13:01,049
How do you know that this girl
hasn't attached herself to you...

1024
01:13:01,133 --> 01:13:03,176
because she's bringing
information back to Morse?

1025
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,554
- This happens.
- Phil. Phil.
- Industrial espionage goes on almost every...

1026
01:13:05,637 --> 01:13:07,764
- Phil. Phil! Listen to me.
- What?

1027
01:13:07,806 --> 01:13:11,852
- She is not a spy. She is a hooker.
- Oh!

1028
01:13:12,644 --> 01:13:14,563
She is a hooker.

1029
01:13:15,981 --> 01:13:19,985
I picked her up on Hollywood
Boulevard... in your car.

1030
01:13:24,698 --> 01:13:26,324
- Yes.
- Oh, you are...

1031
01:13:26,366 --> 01:13:28,326
- Yes.
- Oh, man!

1032
01:13:30,328 --> 01:13:32,330
You know, you're the only millionaire
I ever heard of...

1033
01:13:32,414 --> 01:13:34,541
who goes looking for a bargain-basement
streetwalker, you know?

1034
01:13:34,624 --> 01:13:36,460
Edward!

1035
01:13:36,501 --> 01:13:39,921
I'm sorry I told you. Senator.

1036
01:13:40,005 --> 01:13:42,049
Senator Adams.
I'm pleased you could make it.

1037
01:13:42,132 --> 01:13:44,551
Thank you. I hope the information
I gave you was helpful.

1038
01:13:44,634 --> 01:13:47,679
Oh, absolutely, yes. Thank you for it.
Now there's no change in it, is there?

1039
01:13:47,763 --> 01:13:50,182
No, it's still bogged down.

1040
01:13:52,559 --> 01:13:56,229
- Having a nice time, Vivian?
- Yeah, I'm having a great time.

1041
01:13:56,313 --> 01:13:58,815
Must be quite a change
from Hollywood Boulevard, hmm?

1042
01:14:00,859 --> 01:14:02,402
What?

1043
01:14:02,486 --> 01:14:04,404
Yeah, Edward told me.

1044
01:14:04,488 --> 01:14:06,573
But don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

1045
01:14:08,533 --> 01:14:11,036
Listen. Maybe, uh,

1046
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:13,997
you and I could get together
sometime after Edward leaves.

1047
01:14:16,291 --> 01:14:18,710
Yeah, sure. Why not?

1048
01:14:20,379 --> 01:14:22,339
Well, then we'll just
have to do that, hmm?

1049
01:14:22,381 --> 01:14:24,341
Philip!

1050
01:14:27,386 --> 01:14:30,681
<i>Hi, tailgaters. I'd like to mention</i>
<i>a couple of our silver sponsors:</i>

1051
01:14:30,722 --> 01:14:33,350
<i>Jacobs Distributors</i>
<i>and Norrell Saddlery.</i>

1052
01:14:33,392 --> 01:14:37,062
<i>And we'd like to give a great big thanks</i>
<i>to our platinum sponsor,</i>

1053
01:14:37,145 --> 01:14:39,064
<i>Edward Lewis Enterprises.</i>

1054
01:14:41,358 --> 01:14:43,985
<i>The ball is in</i>
<i>for chukker number four.</i>

1055
01:14:48,407 --> 01:14:50,367
Ay!

1056
01:14:52,619 --> 01:14:55,414
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

1057
01:14:55,455 --> 01:14:59,584
"Fine." Oh, that's good.
Seven "fines" since we left the match.

1058
01:14:59,668 --> 01:15:01,670
Could I have another word, please?

1059
01:15:01,753 --> 01:15:05,257
Asshole. There's a word.

1060
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:08,969
- Think I liked "fine" better.
- You know what? Just tell me one thing.

1061
01:15:09,052 --> 01:15:11,471
Why did you make me
get all dressed up?

1062
01:15:11,555 --> 01:15:13,890
Well, for one thing,
the clothing was appropriate.

1063
01:15:13,932 --> 01:15:17,811
No. What I mean is, if you
were gonna tell everybody I'm a hooker,

1064
01:15:17,894 --> 01:15:20,480
- why didn't you just let me
wear my own clothes, okay?
- I did not... I did not...

1065
01:15:20,564 --> 01:15:23,692
I mean, in my own clothes, when someone
like that guy Stuckey comes up to me,

1066
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,611
I can handle it... I'm prepared.

1067
01:15:26,653 --> 01:15:31,324
I'm very sorry.
I'm not happy with Stuckey at all
for saying that or doing that.

1068
01:15:31,408 --> 01:15:34,494
But he is my attorney.
I've known him for ten years.

1069
01:15:34,578 --> 01:15:38,040
He thought you were some kind of
an industrial spy. The guy's paranoid.

1070
01:15:38,123 --> 01:15:41,293
What are you, my pimp now?
You know, you think you can just
pass me around to your friends?

1071
01:15:41,376 --> 01:15:43,754
- I'm not some little toy!
- No, you're not my toy.

1072
01:15:43,795 --> 01:15:48,175
I know you're not my toy. Vivian.
Vivian! I'm speaking to you.
Come back here.

1073
01:15:48,258 --> 01:15:52,262
I hate to point out the obvious,
but you are, in fact, a hooker,
and you are my employee.

1074
01:15:52,304 --> 01:15:53,930
Look, you don't own me!
I decide! Okay?

1075
01:15:53,972 --> 01:15:56,600
- I say who, I say when,
- I...
- I say who!

1076
01:15:56,641 --> 01:15:59,061
I refuse to spend the next
three days fighting with you!

1077
01:15:59,144 --> 01:16:01,438
I said I was sorry. I meant it!
That's the end of it!

1078
01:16:03,774 --> 01:16:06,360
I'm sorry I ever met you.

1079
01:16:06,443 --> 01:16:08,987
I'm sorry I ever got
into your stupid car.

1080
01:16:09,029 --> 01:16:11,990
As if you had so many
more appealing options.

1081
01:16:13,867 --> 01:16:18,747
I've never had anyone make me feel
as cheap as you did today.

1082
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:20,999
Somehow I find that
very hard to believe.

1083
01:16:30,092 --> 01:16:33,053
- Where you going?
- I want my money.
I wanna get outta here.

1084
01:17:21,351 --> 01:17:23,270
Come on!

1085
01:17:34,906 --> 01:17:36,867
I'm sorry.

1086
01:17:38,577 --> 01:17:42,205
I wasn't prepared to answer
questions about us.

1087
01:17:44,624 --> 01:17:46,668
It was stupid and cruel.

1088
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:51,048
I didn't mean it.

1089
01:17:51,089 --> 01:17:53,383
I don't want you to go.

1090
01:17:53,425 --> 01:17:57,429
- Could you stay the week?
- Why?

1091
01:17:59,473 --> 01:18:03,560
I saw you talking to David Morse.
I didn't like it.

1092
01:18:04,936 --> 01:18:06,855
We were just talking.

1093
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:12,402
I didn't like it.

1094
01:18:15,238 --> 01:18:16,740
Down?

1095
01:18:30,504 --> 01:18:33,799
- You hurt me.
- Yes.

1096
01:18:36,593 --> 01:18:38,679
Don't do it again.

1097
01:19:00,992 --> 01:19:04,996
First guy I ever loved
was a total nothing.

1098
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:08,959
The second was worse.
My mom called me a bum magnet.

1099
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:13,797
If there was a bum
within a 50-mile radius,
I was completely attracted to him.

1100
01:19:13,839 --> 01:19:17,259
That's how I ended up here.
I followed bum number three.

1101
01:19:19,219 --> 01:19:22,723
So here I was:
no money, no friends, no bum.

1102
01:19:26,852 --> 01:19:28,812
And you chose this
as your profession?

1103
01:19:30,522 --> 01:19:32,566
I worked at
a couple fast-food places.

1104
01:19:33,859 --> 01:19:36,820
Parked cars at wrestling.

1105
01:19:36,862 --> 01:19:39,656
I couldn't make the rent.
I was too ashamed to go home.

1106
01:19:40,907 --> 01:19:43,118
That's when I met Kit.

1107
01:19:43,201 --> 01:19:45,203
She was a hooker
and made it sound so great.

1108
01:19:47,205 --> 01:19:49,124
So one day I did it.

1109
01:19:50,876 --> 01:19:52,836
I cried the whole time.

1110
01:19:55,714 --> 01:19:59,760
But then I got some regulars and, you
know, it's not like anybody plans this.

1111
01:19:59,843 --> 01:20:02,387
It's not your childhood dream.

1112
01:20:06,224 --> 01:20:08,185
You could be so much more.

1113
01:20:11,813 --> 01:20:14,232
People put you down enough,
you start to believe it.

1114
01:20:17,652 --> 01:20:22,407
I think you are a very bright,
very special woman.

1115
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:27,204
The bad stuff is easier to believe.

1116
01:20:28,872 --> 01:20:30,791
You ever notice that?

1117
01:20:39,925 --> 01:20:42,678
- No, I don't want to talk to him now.
Tell him I'll call him on Monday.
- Yes, sir.

1118
01:20:42,761 --> 01:20:45,389
- Where you going? Did he sign this?
- No, he said he had to leave.

1119
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:47,641
Hey, Edward, you can't disappear now.
We're in this too deep.

1120
01:20:47,724 --> 01:20:51,561
Don't panic, Philip.
Morse isn't going anywhere.
I'll be back here in the morning.

1121
01:20:51,603 --> 01:20:53,647
- Did you send the tickets to the hotel?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

1122
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:56,358
- Where are you going?
- I have a date.
- With the hooker?

1123
01:21:01,571 --> 01:21:03,532
Be careful, Philip.

1124
01:21:24,886 --> 01:21:27,014
- Do I look okay?
- Mm.

1125
01:21:27,097 --> 01:21:30,475
- Mm?
- Something's missing.

1126
01:21:30,559 --> 01:21:33,395
Well, nothing else is gonna fit
into this dress, I'll tell ya that.

1127
01:21:33,478 --> 01:21:35,689
Oh, maybe something in this box.

1128
01:21:35,772 --> 01:21:38,233
I don't want you to get too excited.
This is only on loan.

1129
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:51,038
They really let you borrow this
from the jewellery store?

1130
01:21:51,121 --> 01:21:53,999
I'm a very good customer.

1131
01:21:54,082 --> 01:21:57,169
- If you were gonna buy this,
how much would it cost?
- Quarter of a million.

1132
01:21:59,087 --> 01:22:01,006
A quarter of a million dollars?

1133
01:22:06,845 --> 01:22:09,139
So where we going?

1134
01:22:09,181 --> 01:22:11,183
It's a surprise.

1135
01:22:13,477 --> 01:22:17,064
If I forget to tell you later,
I had a really good time tonight.

1136
01:22:19,024 --> 01:22:21,026
Thank you.

1137
01:22:39,544 --> 01:22:43,215
When you're not fidgeting, you look
very beautiful... and very tall.

1138
01:22:43,298 --> 01:22:46,718
<i>You're a dream coming true</i>

1139
01:22:48,136 --> 01:22:50,889
<i>I can't believe how</i>

1140
01:22:50,931 --> 01:22:54,393
<i>I have fallen for you</i>

1141
01:22:56,436 --> 01:22:59,815
<i>You are the one</i>

1142
01:22:59,898 --> 01:23:02,401
<i>Who's led me to the sun</i>

1143
01:23:04,778 --> 01:23:08,615
- <i>How could I know</i>
- You don't want to go all the way to
San Francisco in a limousine, do you?

1144
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:12,452
- <i>That I was lost without you</i>
- I've never been on a plane before.
- How'd you get to L. A?

1145
01:23:12,536 --> 01:23:15,914
- Like this.
- <i>And I want to tell you</i>

1146
01:23:15,997 --> 01:23:19,459
<i>You control my brain</i>

1147
01:23:21,378 --> 01:23:24,131
<i>And you should know that</i>

1148
01:23:24,214 --> 01:23:27,342
<i>You are life in my veins</i>

1149
01:23:27,426 --> 01:23:29,678
<i>Well, it should be</i>
<i>a pretty smooth flight, Mr Lewis.</i>

1150
01:23:29,761 --> 01:23:32,097
<i>The weather is clear</i>
<i>all the way up to San Francisco.</i>

1151
01:23:32,139 --> 01:23:34,099
<i>We should be there</i>
<i>in about 50 minutes.</i>

1152
01:23:45,944 --> 01:23:49,114
- We're late.
- No, it's all right.

1153
01:23:49,197 --> 01:23:51,491
- Opening night never starts on time.
- Okay.

1154
01:23:53,452 --> 01:23:55,412
- Programme, sir?
- Thank you.

1155
01:23:59,291 --> 01:24:01,293
Nice to meet you.

1156
01:24:04,629 --> 01:24:06,590
Right this way, Mr Lewis.

1157
01:24:11,636 --> 01:24:13,305
- Doris.
- Edward, how are you?
- It's nice to see you.

1158
01:24:13,388 --> 01:24:15,182
- Always nice to see you.
- Sir?
- Good evening, Edward.

1159
01:24:15,265 --> 01:24:17,059
- Wonderful. Wonderful news.
Congratulations.
- Hey, come here.

1160
01:24:17,142 --> 01:24:21,146
- You gotta look at this.
- It's all right. I've already seen it.

1161
01:24:21,188 --> 01:24:23,940
Oh. If you're afraid of heights,
why do you get seats up here?

1162
01:24:23,982 --> 01:24:26,318
Because they're the best.

1163
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,487
- Is there anything else, sir?
- No, thank you.

1164
01:24:28,528 --> 01:24:30,572
- The glasses are there. Enjoy the opera.
- Oh.

1165
01:24:32,491 --> 01:24:35,452
So... you said this is in Italian.

1166
01:24:35,494 --> 01:24:37,496
- Mm-hmm.
- So how am I gonna know
what they're saying?

1167
01:24:37,537 --> 01:24:39,539
These are broken.
Mine are broken.

1168
01:24:39,623 --> 01:24:41,541
No, no, it's okay.
It's all right.

1169
01:24:43,835 --> 01:24:46,254
- Oh.
- You'll know. Believe me,
you'll understand.

1170
01:24:46,338 --> 01:24:49,383
The music's very powerful.

1171
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:52,969
There's a band.

1172
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:59,226
People's reactions to opera the first
time they see it is very dramatic.

1173
01:24:59,309 --> 01:25:02,187
They either love it or they hate it.

1174
01:25:02,229 --> 01:25:05,399
If they love it, they will
always love it. If they don't,

1175
01:25:05,482 --> 01:25:08,110
they may learn
to appreciate it,

1176
01:25:08,193 --> 01:25:10,404
but it will never become
part of their soul.

1177
01:26:57,010 --> 01:27:00,514
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

1178
01:27:00,597 --> 01:27:03,100
Bravo!

1179
01:27:07,479 --> 01:27:09,815
Did you enjoy the opera, dear?

1180
01:27:09,856 --> 01:27:12,651
Oh, it was so good
I almost peed in my pants.

1181
01:27:12,693 --> 01:27:15,112
What?

1182
01:27:15,153 --> 01:27:18,657
She said she liked it better
than <i>Pirates of Penzance.</i>

1183
01:27:18,699 --> 01:27:20,701
- Oh!
- Yes.

1184
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:30,544
- No, don't touch.
- I move the queen. I like the queen.

1185
01:27:30,627 --> 01:27:32,838
No, you can't move
the queen there.

1186
01:27:32,879 --> 01:27:35,007
I thought you were gonna do that!

1187
01:27:36,925 --> 01:27:40,262
Why don't we finish this tomorrow?
It's really late, and I have to work.

1188
01:27:41,847 --> 01:27:44,766
Why don't you not go to work tomorrow?
Take the day off.

1189
01:27:46,184 --> 01:27:48,770
- Me not work?
- Yeah.

1190
01:27:52,524 --> 01:27:54,443
I do own the company.

1191
01:28:06,496 --> 01:28:10,167
Here are the storage reports you wanted,
and Mr Lewis called.

1192
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:14,379
- What'd he say?
- He said he's taking the day off.

1193
01:28:14,421 --> 01:28:16,465
- He's taking the day off?
- That's what he said.

1194
01:28:20,552 --> 01:28:24,556
I'm starving. There's a snap dog vendor
over there. Do you have any money?

1195
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:26,641
I have money. I don't know
what a snap dog is, but I have money.

1196
01:28:26,725 --> 01:28:31,188
Well, I'm gonna give...
You'll buy a snap dog, we'll cop
a squat under a tree somewhere.

1197
01:28:31,229 --> 01:28:33,190
- Cop a what?
- Cop a squat.

1198
01:28:33,231 --> 01:28:35,817
All right.
Read the first two pages.

1199
01:28:35,901 --> 01:28:37,819
Okay.

1200
01:28:43,533 --> 01:28:46,036
I was talking to someone.
I was talking to...

1201
01:28:46,078 --> 01:28:48,705
"...death ever,
my hopeless cries,

1202
01:28:49,915 --> 01:28:53,085
and look upon myself
and curse my fate."

1203
01:29:24,491 --> 01:29:26,451
He sleeps.

1204
01:31:56,768 --> 01:31:58,729
I love you.

1205
01:32:10,949 --> 01:32:13,035
What are you thinking about,
sitting here all by yourself?

1206
01:32:13,118 --> 01:32:16,246
The fact that this will be
our last night together.

1207
01:32:16,288 --> 01:32:18,540
Then you'll finally be rid of me.

1208
01:32:18,623 --> 01:32:22,127
Well, you've been
pretty tough to take.

1209
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:24,629
My business is almost over,
so I'll be going back to New York.

1210
01:32:30,302 --> 01:32:32,971
I'd really like to see you again.

1211
01:32:33,013 --> 01:32:36,016
- You would?
- Yes. Yes, I would.

1212
01:32:36,099 --> 01:32:39,144
I've arranged for you to have
an apartment, have a car,

1213
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:42,147
have a wide variety of stores
guaranteed to suck up to you...

1214
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:44,191
any time you wanna go shopping.

1215
01:32:44,274 --> 01:32:46,193
Everything's done.

1216
01:32:46,276 --> 01:32:48,195
What else?

1217
01:32:48,278 --> 01:32:51,156
You gonna leave some money by the bed
when you pass through town?

1218
01:32:52,699 --> 01:32:55,494
Vivian, it really
wouldn't be like that.

1219
01:32:55,535 --> 01:33:00,332
- How would it be?
- Well, for one thing, it would
get you off the streets.

1220
01:33:00,415 --> 01:33:02,417
That's just geography.

1221
01:33:13,637 --> 01:33:15,555
Vivian, what is it you want?

1222
01:33:18,225 --> 01:33:22,229
- What do you see happening between us?
- I don't know.

1223
01:33:26,858 --> 01:33:29,861
When I was a little girl,

1224
01:33:29,903 --> 01:33:33,407
my mama used to lock me in the attic
when I was bad, which was pretty often.

1225
01:33:35,325 --> 01:33:39,538
And I would... I would
pretend I was a princess...

1226
01:33:39,579 --> 01:33:42,999
trapped in a tower
by a wicked queen.

1227
01:33:43,041 --> 01:33:46,670
And then suddenly, this knight...

1228
01:33:46,712 --> 01:33:49,256
on a white horse,
with these colours flying,

1229
01:33:49,339 --> 01:33:53,385
would come charging up
and draw his sword.

1230
01:33:53,427 --> 01:33:58,265
And I would wave, and he would climb
up the tower and rescue me.

1231
01:34:02,644 --> 01:34:05,772
But never, in all the time...

1232
01:34:05,856 --> 01:34:09,651
that I had this dream,
did the knight say to me,

1233
01:34:09,735 --> 01:34:12,237
"Come on, baby. I'll put you up
in a great condo."

1234
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,749
- Yes.
- <i>I had to call.</i>

1235
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:26,251
I just got off the phone
with James Morse. Get this.

1236
01:34:26,293 --> 01:34:28,253
<i>He wants to meet with you today.</i>

1237
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:29,755
- What about?
- <i>He wouldn't say.</i>

1238
01:34:29,796 --> 01:34:32,758
Edward, I think we got him.
His nuts are on the block.

1239
01:34:32,799 --> 01:34:34,301
We got him.

1240
01:34:34,384 --> 01:34:36,136
<i>Look, if he's really caving in,</i>
<i>I want to get him...</i>

1241
01:34:36,219 --> 01:34:38,221
<i>to commit his stocks</i>
<i>to us this afternoon. Hmm?</i>

1242
01:34:38,263 --> 01:34:41,433
No, that's no good.
If he's really caving in, I don't
want to wait 'til this afternoon.

1243
01:34:41,475 --> 01:34:43,685
Have Morse meet me downtown
this morning. Goodbye.

1244
01:34:52,402 --> 01:34:55,322
I have to go now.

1245
01:34:55,405 --> 01:34:57,324
I want you to understand.

1246
01:34:59,326 --> 01:35:01,328
I heard everything you said,

1247
01:35:02,579 --> 01:35:04,498
but this is all
I'm capable of right now.

1248
01:35:05,874 --> 01:35:07,834
It's a very big step for me.

1249
01:35:09,544 --> 01:35:13,215
I know. It's a really good offer
for a girl like me.

1250
01:35:16,134 --> 01:35:18,178
I've never treated you
like a prostitute.

1251
01:35:25,227 --> 01:35:27,145
You just did.

1252
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,651
Yes, Barnard Thompson here,
Miss Vivian.

1253
01:35:32,734 --> 01:35:36,697
Could you come down to the front desk?
There's someone here who wants
to speak to you.

1254
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:39,324
- She says her name is Miss De Luca.
- Let me talk to her.

1255
01:35:39,366 --> 01:35:41,326
Let me... Let me
just talk to her.

1256
01:35:42,661 --> 01:35:44,871
Yo, Viv, babe.
Would you come down here?

1257
01:35:44,955 --> 01:35:47,499
The sphincter police
won't let me through.

1258
01:35:47,582 --> 01:35:50,711
- Okay. She's on her way.
- Fine.

1259
01:35:50,794 --> 01:35:52,212
- Mr Thompson.
- Yes.

1260
01:35:52,295 --> 01:35:54,965
The window washer
is refusing to come down.

1261
01:35:55,007 --> 01:35:57,968
It's a Saturday.
Wait here, please. Watch her.

1262
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:00,012
Yes, sir.

1263
01:36:11,356 --> 01:36:15,027
Fifty bucks, Grandpa.
For 75, the wife can watch.

1264
01:36:20,907 --> 01:36:24,453
- Listen, I've been calling you.
- Yeah, I know. They told me
at the Banana you were looking for me.

1265
01:36:24,536 --> 01:36:26,455
You were supposed to come by Tuesday.
I left the money at the desk.

1266
01:36:26,538 --> 01:36:28,540
- I was hidin' out from Carlos.
- Well, if you picked up the money,

1267
01:36:28,623 --> 01:36:30,167
you wouldn't have to hide.

1268
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:32,586
Hey, I was busy. I had a life,
you know. Nino got beat up.

1269
01:36:32,669 --> 01:36:36,131
We had to visit him in the hospital.
Rachel got arrested. It was a mess!

1270
01:36:36,214 --> 01:36:38,884
Anyway, I got the money.
Thank you very much for saving my ass.

1271
01:36:38,925 --> 01:36:42,512
Now Carlos can get off of it. You know,
he was talking about you last night.

1272
01:36:42,554 --> 01:36:44,973
He would bust something
if he saw you in this outfit.

1273
01:36:45,057 --> 01:36:47,476
I was afraid to hug you up there.
I might wrinkle you!

1274
01:36:49,436 --> 01:36:52,397
- You look really good.
- Over there?
- No, something in the shade.

1275
01:36:54,024 --> 01:36:56,651
You clean up real nice.

1276
01:36:56,735 --> 01:37:00,072
Sure don't fit in down on
the boulevard looking like you do,
not that you ever did.

1277
01:37:00,155 --> 01:37:03,658
Well, thanks, but it's easy
to clean up when you got money.

1278
01:37:03,742 --> 01:37:06,620
Yeah.

1279
01:37:06,703 --> 01:37:11,583
- So, when does he leave?
- Tomorrow.

1280
01:37:11,666 --> 01:37:14,002
- You get to keep the clothes?
- Yeah.

1281
01:37:15,253 --> 01:37:17,255
Edward asked me if I
wanted to see him again,

1282
01:37:19,424 --> 01:37:21,343
but I think,
I think definitely no.

1283
01:37:21,426 --> 01:37:24,262
I mean, it's just
another week, right?

1284
01:37:24,346 --> 01:37:27,265
- Definitely no.
- Yeah.

1285
01:37:28,392 --> 01:37:31,269
- Oh, no!
- What?

1286
01:37:31,353 --> 01:37:34,606
- I know this weepy look on your face.
- Oh, no, you don't!

1287
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:37,275
- You fell in love with him, didn't you?
- No. Kit, please!

1288
01:37:37,317 --> 01:37:39,277
- Oh, stop it.
- You've fallen in love with him?
- Kit!

1289
01:37:39,319 --> 01:37:42,447
- Did you kiss him on the mouth?
- Uhhh, uh, yeah. I did.

1290
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:44,449
- You kissed him on the mouth?
- I did. It was nice.

1291
01:37:44,491 --> 01:37:47,536
You fall in love with him
and you kiss him on the mouth?
Did I not teach you anything?

1292
01:37:47,619 --> 01:37:50,789
Look, I'm not stupid, okay?
I'm... I'm not in love with him.

1293
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:54,501
I just... I like him.

1294
01:37:55,585 --> 01:37:58,130
- You like him?
- Yeah.

1295
01:37:58,213 --> 01:38:01,383
You definitely like him.

1296
01:38:01,466 --> 01:38:03,885
Well, he's not a bum.
He's a rich, classy guy.

1297
01:38:03,969 --> 01:38:06,680
Who's gonna break my heart, right?

1298
01:38:06,763 --> 01:38:09,391
Oh, no. Come on. You don't know that.
Hey, he asked you, right?

1299
01:38:09,474 --> 01:38:12,644
Maybe you guys could, like, um,
you know, get a house together,

1300
01:38:12,728 --> 01:38:14,896
and like, buy some diamonds
and a horse.

1301
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:17,983
I don't know.
Anyway, it could work. It happens.

1302
01:38:19,901 --> 01:38:23,113
When does it happen, Kit?
When does it really happen?

1303
01:38:23,155 --> 01:38:26,783
Who does it really work out for? Did it
work out for Skinny Marie or Rachel? No.

1304
01:38:26,825 --> 01:38:28,910
Those were very specific cases
of crackheads.

1305
01:38:28,994 --> 01:38:30,912
I just wanna know
who it works out for.

1306
01:38:30,996 --> 01:38:33,498
You give me one example of somebody
that we know that it happened for.

1307
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,834
- Name someone?
You want me to name someone?
- Yeah, one person that it worked out for.

1308
01:38:35,917 --> 01:38:37,836
- You want me to, like, give you
a name or something?
- Yeah, I'd like a name.

1309
01:38:37,919 --> 01:38:40,380
Oh, God, the pressure of a name.

1310
01:38:44,968 --> 01:38:46,636
Cinder-fuckin'-rella.

1311
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:55,729
Mr Morse, you said this morning
you wish to speak to Mr Lewis.

1312
01:38:55,812 --> 01:38:57,981
Mr Lewis is now listening.

1313
01:38:58,065 --> 01:39:02,444
I've reconsidered my position
on your acquisition offer.

1314
01:39:02,527 --> 01:39:04,529
On one condition.

1315
01:39:04,613 --> 01:39:09,159
I'm not so concerned about me,
but the people who are working for me.

1316
01:39:09,242 --> 01:39:12,204
It's not a problem.
They'll be taken care of.

1317
01:39:12,287 --> 01:39:15,457
Now then, gentlemen,
if we could address ourselves
to the contracts in front of you.

1318
01:39:15,499 --> 01:39:19,336
- If you look...
- Excuse me, Phil.

1319
01:39:19,419 --> 01:39:22,172
Gentlemen, I'd like to speak
to Mr Morse alone.

1320
01:39:23,215 --> 01:39:25,175
Thank you.

1321
01:39:27,135 --> 01:39:29,513
All right, gentlemen.
You heard the man. Please wait outside.

1322
01:39:31,973 --> 01:39:35,310
You too, Phil.

1323
01:39:35,352 --> 01:39:39,523
- What do you mean?
- I mean I would like
to speak to Mr Morse alone.

1324
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,610
Why does he get to stay?

1325
01:39:43,652 --> 01:39:46,071
Please. Please.

1326
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:52,994
- I'll be right outside.
- Good.

1327
01:40:09,761 --> 01:40:11,805
- Is that better?
- It's all right.

1328
01:40:11,847 --> 01:40:15,642
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Black.

1329
01:40:18,895 --> 01:40:23,692
Mr Morse... my interests
in your company have changed.

1330
01:40:25,318 --> 01:40:28,697
What is it you're after now,
Mr Lewis?

1331
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:32,868
Well, I no longer wish to buy
your company and take it apart.

1332
01:40:32,909 --> 01:40:35,245
But I don't want
anyone else to either.

1333
01:40:35,328 --> 01:40:37,581
And it is still
extremely vulnerable.

1334
01:40:39,166 --> 01:40:43,128
So I find myself
in unfamiliar territory.

1335
01:40:45,047 --> 01:40:48,050
I wanna help you.

1336
01:40:48,091 --> 01:40:50,302
Why?

1337
01:40:58,310 --> 01:41:01,772
Mr Morse, I think we can do something
very special with your company.

1338
01:41:02,856 --> 01:41:05,567
What about our Navy contracts?

1339
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:08,070
Ah, they weren't dead.
Just delayed.

1340
01:41:08,153 --> 01:41:10,947
- I bluffed a little bit.
- You're very good at it.

1341
01:41:11,031 --> 01:41:12,991
Thank you very much.
It's my job.

1342
01:41:15,744 --> 01:41:18,038
I think we can leave the details
up to the others.

1343
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:21,083
I find this hard to say
without sounding condescending,

1344
01:41:21,166 --> 01:41:23,502
but... I'm proud of you.

1345
01:41:27,839 --> 01:41:30,967
Thank you.

1346
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:34,096
I think we can let in
the other suits now.

1347
01:41:36,723 --> 01:41:38,642
Let's continue the meeting.

1348
01:41:40,018 --> 01:41:42,145
Come in, gentlemen. Sit down.

1349
01:41:42,229 --> 01:41:44,231
Edward, please.
What was this all about?

1350
01:41:46,066 --> 01:41:48,610
It's all yours, Phil.
Finish it up.

1351
01:41:51,446 --> 01:41:54,950
Hold it. Hold it, these aren't signed.
These aren't signed!

1352
01:41:55,033 --> 01:41:57,786
Can someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on here?

1353
01:41:57,869 --> 01:42:01,415
Mr Lewis and I are going
to build ships together.

1354
01:42:01,456 --> 01:42:03,166
Great big ships.

1355
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:08,338
You know, I think
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1356
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:11,133
- Just stay here for a while.
I'll be back.
- Yes, sir, Mr Lewis.

1357
01:42:33,864 --> 01:42:39,161
Well, well. Hello again.
I'm looking for Edward.

1358
01:42:39,202 --> 01:42:42,080
Edward's not here.
I thought he was with you.

1359
01:42:42,164 --> 01:42:45,500
No. Uh, Edward is
definitely not with me.

1360
01:42:48,170 --> 01:42:52,049
No, if Edward were with me...

1361
01:42:52,132 --> 01:42:56,887
When, actually.
When Edward was with me,

1362
01:42:56,970 --> 01:42:59,639
he didn't blow off
billion-dollar deals.

1363
01:42:59,681 --> 01:43:02,851
No, I think that, uh,

1364
01:43:02,893 --> 01:43:05,270
Edward's with you,
that's what I think.

1365
01:43:05,354 --> 01:43:07,356
- Mind if I have a drink?
- No.

1366
01:43:08,523 --> 01:43:10,484
No, thank you.

1367
01:43:11,693 --> 01:43:14,988
Well, I'll just wait.

1368
01:43:15,030 --> 01:43:18,909
Uh, Edward will be back soon.
Any minute, he'll be home.

1369
01:43:21,536 --> 01:43:23,497
You know...

1370
01:43:25,248 --> 01:43:28,627
This is not home.
This is, uh, a hotel room.

1371
01:43:30,045 --> 01:43:34,216
And, uh, you are not...
the little woman.

1372
01:43:36,426 --> 01:43:39,388
You're a hooker.

1373
01:43:39,429 --> 01:43:42,432
Maybe you're a very good hooker,
you know?

1374
01:43:42,516 --> 01:43:46,311
I mean, maybe if I do you,
then I wouldn't care about
losing millions of dollars,

1375
01:43:46,395 --> 01:43:49,564
because I have to be very honest
with you right now, Vivian.

1376
01:43:49,648 --> 01:43:51,900
Right now I really do care.
I really do.

1377
01:43:51,942 --> 01:43:54,736
And right now I am
really pissed, you know?

1378
01:43:56,071 --> 01:43:58,407
Right now
I am just freaking out.

1379
01:44:00,409 --> 01:44:03,662
So maybe if I screw you, huh,
and take you to the opera,

1380
01:44:03,745 --> 01:44:06,248
- then I could be a happy guy
just like Edward.
- Hey, get off me!

1381
01:44:06,289 --> 01:44:09,126
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Goddam it!

1382
01:44:09,209 --> 01:44:11,837
- Ow!
- Ow!

1383
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,089
- Come on! Come on! Okay, whore.
- Get off me!

1384
01:44:14,172 --> 01:44:16,174
- Let's do it!
- Get off me!
- How much is it? A hundred bucks?

1385
01:44:16,258 --> 01:44:18,593
- Ninety bucks? Fifty?
- Get off me!
- You a 50-dollar whore, Vivian?

1386
01:44:18,677 --> 01:44:21,263
What are you doing?
Get off her! Get off her!

1387
01:44:21,346 --> 01:44:25,100
- Stop! I don't wanna hurt you! Stop!
- I don't know how to tell you this.
You already did, Edward!

1388
01:44:25,142 --> 01:44:27,686
- Ow! All right. All right!
- Get outta here!

1389
01:44:27,769 --> 01:44:31,648
Look. She's a whore, man.
She's a goddam... Ah!

1390
01:44:34,109 --> 01:44:36,862
- Damn it!
- Shit! Goddam it!

1391
01:44:38,864 --> 01:44:40,991
- I think you broke my nose.
- Get outta here.

1392
01:44:41,074 --> 01:44:44,453
What is wrong with you?
Come on, Edward! I gave you ten years!

1393
01:44:44,536 --> 01:44:46,913
I devoted my whole life to you!

1394
01:44:46,955 --> 01:44:49,708
That's bullshit.
This is such bullshit!

1395
01:44:49,791 --> 01:44:51,835
It's the kill you love, not me!

1396
01:44:51,918 --> 01:44:55,130
And I made you a very rich man
doing exactly what you loved!

1397
01:44:55,172 --> 01:44:57,132
Now get outta here!

1398
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,719
Get out!

1399
01:45:10,187 --> 01:45:13,732
Why do guys know how to hit a woman
right across the cheek?

1400
01:45:13,815 --> 01:45:16,985
Wham! And it feels like
your eye is gonna explode.

1401
01:45:17,027 --> 01:45:20,655
What do they do? Do they, they
pull you aside in high school
and show you how to do this?

1402
01:45:20,739 --> 01:45:22,657
Is that... Ow!

1403
01:45:26,370 --> 01:45:28,330
Not all guys hit.

1404
01:45:31,917 --> 01:45:34,169
I heard about what you did
with Morse.

1405
01:45:35,712 --> 01:45:38,006
It was a business decision.

1406
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:41,968
- It was good.
- It felt good.

1407
01:45:45,847 --> 01:45:47,849
I think this is okay.

1408
01:45:48,892 --> 01:45:50,686
I gotta get going.

1409
01:45:50,727 --> 01:45:53,689
Yes, I noticed you packed.

1410
01:45:53,772 --> 01:45:55,774
Why are you leaving now?

1411
01:45:58,026 --> 01:46:01,863
Edward, there'll always be some guy,
even some friend of yours,

1412
01:46:01,905 --> 01:46:04,032
thinking he can treat me
like Stuckey...

1413
01:46:04,116 --> 01:46:06,743
thinking that it's allowed.

1414
01:46:06,827 --> 01:46:09,996
What are you gonna do?
You gonna beat up everybody?

1415
01:46:11,957 --> 01:46:13,875
That's not why you're leaving.

1416
01:46:15,544 --> 01:46:19,631
Look. You made me
a really nice offer.

1417
01:46:19,715 --> 01:46:22,884
And a few months ago, no problem.

1418
01:46:22,926 --> 01:46:28,473
But now everything is different, and you
changed that, and you can't change back.

1419
01:46:29,641 --> 01:46:31,560
I want more.

1420
01:46:33,186 --> 01:46:35,689
I know about wanting more.

1421
01:46:35,731 --> 01:46:37,691
I invented the concept.

1422
01:46:39,776 --> 01:46:42,195
The question is, how much more?

1423
01:46:43,739 --> 01:46:45,699
I want the fairy tale.

1424
01:46:47,868 --> 01:46:49,870
Impossible relationships.

1425
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:56,793
My special gift
is impossible relationships.

1426
01:47:09,264 --> 01:47:11,475
Thank you.

1427
01:47:11,558 --> 01:47:13,477
You're welcome.

1428
01:47:15,062 --> 01:47:17,356
If you ever need anything...

1429
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:20,108
dental floss, whatever...
you give me a call.

1430
01:47:24,696 --> 01:47:26,948
I had a good time.

1431
01:47:27,032 --> 01:47:28,950
Me too.

1432
01:47:39,294 --> 01:47:41,463
You want me to get you a bellboy?

1433
01:47:41,505 --> 01:47:44,675
- No, I got it.
- I'll carry this.

1434
01:47:44,758 --> 01:47:46,677
Thanks.

1435
01:47:53,433 --> 01:47:55,977
Stay. Stay the night with me.

1436
01:47:57,479 --> 01:48:00,148
Not because I'm paying you,
but because you want to.

1437
01:48:05,445 --> 01:48:06,988
I can't.

1438
01:48:14,413 --> 01:48:16,331
Goodbye.

1439
01:48:23,255 --> 01:48:25,465
I think you have
a lot of special gifts.

1440
01:48:40,313 --> 01:48:42,232
- I didn't do it, sir.
- No, no. I know.

1441
01:48:42,315 --> 01:48:44,735
I didn't say that.
I want you to call Maintenance
and have them deal with this.

1442
01:48:44,818 --> 01:48:46,737
- You must delegate authority.
- Yes, sir.

1443
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:50,157
- Hi, Barney.
- Miss Vivian.

1444
01:48:52,117 --> 01:48:55,579
- Thank you.
- I wanted to say goodbye.

1445
01:48:55,662 --> 01:48:58,707
Well, then I gather you're not
accompanying Mr Lewis to New York?

1446
01:48:58,749 --> 01:49:03,587
Come on, Barney. You and me live
in the real world, most of the time.

1447
01:49:05,172 --> 01:49:07,174
Have you arranged
for transportation?

1448
01:49:07,215 --> 01:49:10,010
- I'm gonna call a cab.
- No, allow me. Darryl.

1449
01:49:10,052 --> 01:49:11,636
Yes, sir?

1450
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:14,473
Please take Miss Vivian
anywhere she wishes to go.

1451
01:49:14,556 --> 01:49:16,516
Yes, sir.

1452
01:49:23,315 --> 01:49:26,735
It's been a pleasure knowing you.
Come and visit us again sometime.

1453
01:49:29,446 --> 01:49:31,406
Stay cool.

1454
01:49:44,086 --> 01:49:47,089
<i>Lay a whisper</i>

1455
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:50,050
<i>On my pillow</i>

1456
01:49:50,092 --> 01:49:52,969
<i>Leave the winter</i>

1457
01:49:53,053 --> 01:49:55,931
<i>On the ground</i>

1458
01:49:55,972 --> 01:49:58,892
<i>I wake up lonely</i>

1459
01:49:58,934 --> 01:50:02,354
<i>The stare of silence</i>

1460
01:50:02,437 --> 01:50:05,065
<i>In the bedroom</i>

1461
01:50:05,107 --> 01:50:08,151
<i>- And all around</i>
<i>- All around</i>

1462
01:50:08,235 --> 01:50:10,946
<i>Touch me now</i>

1463
01:50:10,987 --> 01:50:14,074
<i>I close my eyes</i>

1464
01:50:14,116 --> 01:50:16,451
<i>And dream away</i>

1465
01:50:19,454 --> 01:50:22,124
<i>It must have been love</i>

1466
01:50:22,207 --> 01:50:25,335
<i>But it's over now</i>

1467
01:50:25,419 --> 01:50:28,130
<i>It must have been good</i>

1468
01:50:28,171 --> 01:50:31,466
<i>But I lost it somehow</i>

1469
01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:34,261
<i>It must have been love</i>

1470
01:50:34,302 --> 01:50:37,180
<i>But it's over now</i>

1471
01:50:37,264 --> 01:50:40,142
<i>From the moment we touched</i>

1472
01:50:40,183 --> 01:50:43,061
<i>'Til the time had run out</i>

1473
01:51:01,663 --> 01:51:03,373
Is that everything, sir?

1474
01:51:03,457 --> 01:51:06,001
- Yes, yes, that's everything.
- I'll meet you downstairs.

1475
01:51:06,043 --> 01:51:08,003
Thank you.

1476
01:51:10,464 --> 01:51:12,382
You look so dopey!

1477
01:51:14,634 --> 01:51:17,054
San Francisco's
not that great, you know.

1478
01:51:17,137 --> 01:51:19,181
It's a bad climate.

1479
01:51:19,222 --> 01:51:22,267
- It's foggy. It's unpredictable.
- I'll wear a sweater.

1480
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:25,520
What are you gonna do there?

1481
01:51:25,562 --> 01:51:28,023
Get a job. Finish high school.

1482
01:51:28,106 --> 01:51:31,693
You know, I got things I can do,
you know. I used to make pretty
good grades in high school.

1483
01:51:31,777 --> 01:51:33,737
Yeah, I could see that about you.
I could see that.

1484
01:51:39,368 --> 01:51:41,370
Sure you won't come with me?

1485
01:51:41,411 --> 01:51:44,164
And leave all this?
Not in a million.

1486
01:51:45,624 --> 01:51:47,709
Come here.

1487
01:51:52,047 --> 01:51:54,800
Whoa! Whoa, what is this?

1488
01:51:56,385 --> 01:51:59,721
It's part of the Edward Lewis
Scholarship Fund.

1489
01:51:59,763 --> 01:52:02,391
We think you got a lot
of potential, Kit De Luca.

1490
01:52:02,474 --> 01:52:05,560
You do?

1491
01:52:05,644 --> 01:52:08,438
- You think I got potential?
- Oh, yeah.

1492
01:52:09,731 --> 01:52:12,442
Don't let anybody
tell you different, okay?

1493
01:52:12,526 --> 01:52:15,070
Okay.

1494
01:52:15,153 --> 01:52:18,615
- Take care of you.
- Oh, no. I can't. I can't.
It's your favourite.

1495
01:52:20,575 --> 01:52:23,286
What time's your bus?

1496
01:52:23,370 --> 01:52:25,747
An hour.

1497
01:52:25,831 --> 01:52:28,291
Yeah, well, I gotta split
'cause goodbyes make me crazy.

1498
01:52:28,375 --> 01:52:30,711
- So take care of you.
- Whoa.

1499
01:52:37,551 --> 01:52:41,680
- Mr Lewis.
- You don't have any messages
for me, do you?

1500
01:52:41,763 --> 01:52:43,432
No, I'm afraid not, sir.

1501
01:52:46,393 --> 01:52:48,562
- I'll need a car
to the airport also.
- Of course.

1502
01:52:48,603 --> 01:52:50,647
Darryl will take you
wherever you need to go.

1503
01:52:50,731 --> 01:52:52,816
- Darryl, the limousine
out front, please?
- Yes, sir.

1504
01:52:52,899 --> 01:52:54,818
Thank you, Darryl.

1505
01:52:57,487 --> 01:52:58,905
- One last thing.
- Yes.

1506
01:52:58,989 --> 01:53:01,283
If you could possibly return
this to Fred's for me, please.

1507
01:53:01,366 --> 01:53:03,618
Yes, of course, sir.

1508
01:53:03,702 --> 01:53:07,289
- May I, sir?
- Of course, please.

1509
01:53:14,463 --> 01:53:17,591
It must be difficult to let go
of something so beautiful.

1510
01:53:20,761 --> 01:53:24,264
You know, Darryl also drove
Miss Vivian home yesterday.

1511
01:53:29,144 --> 01:53:31,480
I'll take care of it.

1512
01:53:31,563 --> 01:53:33,774
Thank you, Mr Thompson.

1513
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:48,163
Your plane is leaving
as scheduled, sir,

1514
01:53:48,246 --> 01:53:50,332
and you should be back
in New York on time.

1515
01:54:02,052 --> 01:54:05,013
I'm gonna have to charge you
a little more rent than Vivian...

1516
01:54:05,097 --> 01:54:07,182
because I got this beauty course
I'm lookin' into.

1517
01:54:07,265 --> 01:54:09,810
I'm not gonna be there that much.
You know? 'Cause you can't...

1518
01:54:09,851 --> 01:54:13,897
You just can't turn tricks forever. You
gotta have a goal. Do you have a goal?

1519
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:16,191
Well, I always wanted to be
in the Ice Capades.

1520
01:54:16,233 --> 01:54:18,193
Help you, love?

1521
01:54:18,276 --> 01:54:20,278
Here we go.
Thank you very much.

1522
01:54:20,362 --> 01:54:22,280
So you got a lot of stuff
you gotta move in?

1523
01:54:22,364 --> 01:54:25,575
No, Carlos burned most of my stuff
when I said I was movin' out.

1524
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:56,231
Vivian!

1525
01:54:56,314 --> 01:54:58,400
Vivian!

1526
01:55:01,737 --> 01:55:04,072
Princess Vivian, come down!

1527
01:55:08,869 --> 01:55:12,330
- It had to be the top floor, right?
- It's the best!

1528
01:55:12,414 --> 01:55:14,750
All right. I'm coming up.

1529
01:55:49,951 --> 01:55:55,290
So what happened after he
climbed up the tower and rescued her?

1530
01:55:55,374 --> 01:55:57,292
She rescues him right back.

1531
01:56:07,969 --> 01:56:09,930
Welcome to Hollywood!

1532
01:56:09,971 --> 01:56:12,974
What's your dream?
Everybody comes here.

1533
01:56:13,016 --> 01:56:16,311
This is Hollywood, land o' dreams.

1534
01:56:16,353 --> 01:56:19,022
Some dreams come true, some don't.

1535
01:56:19,106 --> 01:56:22,192
But keep on dreamin'.
This is Hollywood.

1536
01:56:22,275 --> 01:56:25,987
Always time to dream,
so keep on dreamin'.

1537
01:56:26,279 --> 01:56:29,866
<i>Pretty woman</i>
<i>walking down the street</i>

1538
01:56:29,950 --> 01:56:33,662
<i>Pretty woman,</i>
<i>the kind I like to meet</i>

1539
01:56:33,704 --> 01:56:36,206
<i>Pretty woman</i>

1540
01:56:36,289 --> 01:56:40,002
<i>I don't believe you</i>
<i>You're not the truth</i>

1541
01:56:40,043 --> 01:56:44,464
<i>No one could look</i>
<i>as good as you</i>

1542
01:56:46,341 --> 01:56:48,343
<i>Mercy</i>

1543
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:55,350
<i>Pretty woman,</i>
<i>won't you pardon me</i>

1544
01:56:55,392 --> 01:56:59,062
<i>Pretty woman,</i>
<i>I couldn't help but see</i>

1545
01:56:59,146 --> 01:57:01,773
<i>Pretty woman</i>

1546
01:57:01,857 --> 01:57:05,777
<i>And you look lovely as can be</i>

1547
01:57:05,861 --> 01:57:10,032
<i>Are you lonely just like me</i>

1548
01:57:12,075 --> 01:57:15,120
<i>Oh, oh</i>

1549
01:57:15,203 --> 01:57:17,122
<i>Pretty woman</i>

1550
01:57:32,471 --> 01:57:35,766
<i>You really took me by surprise</i>

1551
01:57:39,311 --> 01:57:43,899
<i>You're someone I've needed</i>
<i>for a lifetime</i>

1552
01:57:46,318 --> 01:57:49,863
<i>Your heart was cleverly disguised</i>

1553
01:57:53,367 --> 01:57:58,413
<i>And didn't look that way</i>
<i>in my mind</i>

1554
01:57:58,455 --> 01:58:01,249
<i>Tell me how could it be</i>

1555
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:03,460
<i>I was the last to know</i>

1556
01:58:05,504 --> 01:58:09,883
<i>Darlin', I couldn't read</i>
<i>what was in your mind</i>

1557
01:58:09,925 --> 01:58:13,345
<i>To turn around and love me</i>

1558
01:58:13,428 --> 01:58:18,392
<i>With no explanation</i>

1559
01:58:19,726 --> 01:58:23,188
<i>I gave you everything I had</i>

1560
01:58:23,271 --> 01:58:27,401
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>that you would take it</i>

1561
01:58:27,442 --> 01:58:32,114
<i>With sweet consideration</i>

1562
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:36,785
<i>And after all</i>
<i>that we've been through</i>

1563
01:58:37,953 --> 01:58:41,331
<i>I can't believe it's true</i>

1564
01:58:41,415 --> 01:58:46,169
<i>Until I hear you say it</i>

1565
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:54,302
<i>Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo</i>

1566
01:58:58,306 --> 01:59:01,393
<i>And on and on and on and on</i>

1567
01:59:05,981 --> 01:59:09,401
<i>There's no explaining</i>

1568
01:59:13,321 --> 01:59:17,701
<i>With no explanation</i>

1569
01:59:19,244 --> 01:59:22,664
<i>I gave you everything I had</i>

1570
01:59:22,748 --> 01:59:26,710
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>that you would take it</i>
