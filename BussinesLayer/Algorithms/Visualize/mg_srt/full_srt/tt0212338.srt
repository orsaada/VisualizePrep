Oh, boy, oh, boy!

168
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,274
BOTH: Short stack,
short stack, coming up.

169
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,570
Where's my "wittle" girl?

170
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,738
Mommy! Mom!

171
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,907
You look so beautiful.

172
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,118
PAM: So do you. Look at you.

173
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,912
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mom, Dad, this is Greg.

174
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,414
Hi, Greg. I'm Pam's father,
Jack Byrnes.

175
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,707
Great to finally meet you.

176
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,791
Good meeting you.

177
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,585
And I'm Dina.
Welcome to Oyster Bay.

178
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,836
Oh, thanks.

179
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,427
What are you driving there,
a Ford?

180
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,679
Yeah, it's a Taurus.

181
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,558
We were gonna get a mid-size,
but I figure, hey,
we pull down decent bucks.

182
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,352
Might as well go all out,
pop for the full-size.

183
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,231
Sure. Interesting color.
You pick it?

184
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,109
Oh, no, the guy
at the counter. Why?

185
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,403
Well, they say geniuses
pick green.

186
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,948
But you didn't pick it.

187
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,241
DINA: Jack!

188
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,580
Yucky. What smells
of old sour milk?

189
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,206
Poor Greg got
spit up on by a baby.

190
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,583
DINA: He didn't.

191
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:30,253
Yeah, he did, Ma,
at the lost luggage counter.
The airline lost his bag.

192
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,963
They didn't!

193
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,465
Yeah.
Yeah, they did.

194
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,051
What about you, honey?
No, no, no. I carried on.

195
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,094
That's my girl.

196
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,181
It'll turn up, I'm sure.

197
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:45,310
And anyway, Greg, meanwhile,
anything you need, just ask.

198
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,395
That's right.
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

199
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,439
Thanks, Jack. You too.

200
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,732
Yeah.

201
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,699
This is so nice.

202
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,992
JACK: We like it.

203
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,411
G REG: Beautiful.

204
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,957
Now, Greg, you have
a very unique last name.

205
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,961
We were curious,
how do you pronounce it?

206
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,550
Just like it's spelled.
F-O-C-K-E-R.

207
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,888
Focker.
Focker.

208
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,724
Mmm-hmm.

209
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,061
Oh, I'll get it, honey.

210
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,562
Oh, thanks, Mom.

211
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,399
There he is.
There's our little guy.

212
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,858
PAM: Jinxy, come here, boy.

213
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,862
Come here, baby.
Come to Daddy, Jinxy.
Come on. Come on, Jinxy.

214
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,072
Jinxy!

215
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,782
Come here. Come to Daddy.
Come on.

216
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,743
Taught him that in one week.

217
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,122
This is Pam's cat, Jinxy.
Jinxy, say hello to Greg.

218
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,206
Hi, Jinx.
Wave to Greg.

219
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,457
Hello, Jinx.

220
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,252
Attaboy. That took me
another week.

221
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,920
Oh, my gosh.

222
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,714
Pam, I didn't know
you had a cat.

223
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,465
Yeah, I left him here
when I moved to Chicago.

224
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,926
Your daddy's found
his new best friend.

225
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,304
You won't believe it.
He even taught him
to use the potty.

226
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,223
He did? Dad, that's kind of
weird, isn't it?

227
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,683
What's so weird about it?

228
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,643
Now we don't have to smell
kitty litter all the time.

229
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,936
That's right.

230
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,022
That's incredible.
How did you teach
the cat to use the toilet?

231
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:17,068
That was easy, Greg.
I just designed a litter box
to put inside the toilet,

232
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,863
and then once he got
used to it, I took it away.

233
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,699
Yeah, makes sense.
But I don't think he likes it.

234
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,827
I mean, every chance he gets,
he tries to dig,
squat and bury.

235
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,496
I had to move all
my potted plants
off the floor.

236
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,125
Plus, you got another
guy around the house
to leave the seat up.

237
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,712
He can't lift the seat, Greg.

238
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,631
He lacks the strength
and the opposable thumbs.

239
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,716
Yeah.

240
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,094
Right. Opposable...
I didn't think about that.

241
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,345
Jinx is strictly a house cat.

242
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,891
Can't let him outside
because he lacks
outdoor survival skills.

243
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,976
Okay.
JACK: One of those things,
isn't it, sweetheart?

244
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,855
I don't think Greg will be
playing with Jinxy too much.
He hates cats.

245
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,859
Pam, I don't hate cats.

246
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,820
I don't hate cats.
I just happen to be
more of a dog lover.

247
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,697
Yeah, yeah.
I am too.

248
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,616
Well, that's okay
if you hate cats, Greg.

249
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,411
No! I don't.
I don't hate cats at all.

250
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,496
JACK: That's okay.

251
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,457
Just be honest about it.
There's some things I hate.

252
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,210
I'm being honest.
Really? Like what?

253
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,964
Honey, why don't we let
the kids freshen up, huh?

254
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,466
Greg, you come with me.

255
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,719
We'll get you something
to wear from Jack's closet,
okay?

256
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,305
Okay.
Honey.

257
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,932
Yeah?

258
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,433
I'm so happy you're home,
sweetheart.

259
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,519
Me too, Daddy.

260
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:39,901
Hey, listen,
be nice to this one, okay?
I kind of like him.

261
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,153
Okay, I'll try.

262
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,446
Thank you.

263
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,956
JACK: Shirt fit okay, Greg?

264
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,582
Fantastic. Thanks, Jack.

265
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,292
Good. Tom Collins coming up.

266
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,337
You know, I wish you
hadn't told your parents
I hate cats.

267
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,922
But you do hate cats.

268
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,674
Yeah, but you didn't
have to tell them
right when we met.

269
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,300
I know. I'm sorry.
lt just kind of slipped out.

270
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,470
Get your red-hot pupus.

271
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,764
My goodness, what is that?

272
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,601
That's just a little
something from me.

273
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,311
Go ahead. Open it up.

274
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,439
Look, honey,
Greg brought us a present.

275
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,066
JACK: lsn't that nice?

276
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,448
Look at this.

277
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,618
It's a flower pot
with the dirt in it.

278
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,498
Actually, the real gift
is what's planted in the soil.

279
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,626
The bulb of a Jerusalem tulip,

280
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:45,633
which I was told is one of
the rarest and most beautiful
flowers in existence.

281
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,346
Right, the Jerusalem...

282
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,142
From the
"Jerusales tulipesias"
genus. Yes.

283
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:59,647
Anyway, the guy said
with regular watering,

284
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,900
it should bloom in
about six months, so...

285
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,319
We'll look forward
to that, Greg.

286
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,201
(CLEARS TH ROAT)

287
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,747
So, Greg, how's your job?

288
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,834
Good, Pam. Thanks for asking.

289
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,421
I recently got
transferred to triage.

290
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,423
Is that better than a nurse?

291
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,426
No, Mom, triage
is a unit of the E. R.

292
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,762
It's where
all the top nurses work.
Well...

293
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,597
No, they do.

294
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,810
Not many men
in your profession, though,
are there, Greg?

295
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,855
No, Jack, not traditionally.

296
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,654
Pam, honey, did you know that
your father started
his own business?

297
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:51,115
Really? Dad, that's great.
Wow!

298
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,242
Yes, I thought with
my knowledge and experience,

299
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,787
why should I allow
retirement to stop me?

300
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,956
I really admire that.
Yeah.

301
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,792
So what is it?
What's the new venture?

302
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,003
Let me ask you
a question, Greg.

303
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,589
Let's just say you have kids
and you wanna
get out of the house,

304
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,133
spend a night on the town.

305
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,428
So, you hire a baby-sitter,
someone you think
you can trust.

306
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,390
References, work experience,
it all checks out fine.

307
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,309
But then how do you
really know for certain

308
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,229
that your loved ones are safe
with this stranger?

309
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,525
I mean, can you ever
really trust another
human being, Greg?

310
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,821
Sure, I think so.

311
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,615
No, the answer is you cannot.

312
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,078
Let me show you something.

313
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,747
Take a look at this, Greg.

314
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,710
What's this look like to you?

315
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,797
This looks like a teddy bear.

316
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,425
Smile, you're on
"Nanny Camera."

317
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,178
Yeah! I've seen these things
advertised on TV.

318
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,806
No, not like this,
you haven't. Take a look.

319
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,019
Oh, my gosh. Hi!

320
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,186
Where's the other camera?

321
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,689
Right here in this
decorative artifact.

322
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,025
Wow, that's great.

323
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,484
JACK: Our cameras are
motion-activated,

324
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,695
so they begin taping as soon
as they sense any movement.

325
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,821
We can hide them in anything.

326
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:15,366
We hide them in mirrors,
lamps, televisions,
you name it.

327
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,410
So no matter where you go,

328
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,371
we'll be watching you.

329
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,920
So, Jack, couldn't this maybe
be construed as illegal?
You know, invasion of privacy?

330
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,216
Trust me, Greg, when you
start having little Fockers
running around,

331
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,428
you'll understand the need
for this level of protection.

332
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,060
lmpressive, isn't it?

333
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,853
Quite.

334
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,647
I'll get that.
I'll get it.

Honey, I'll get it.

336
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,650
Okay.

337
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,780
Any problem
with the documents?

338
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,867
Okay. I'll meet you at the
Oyster Bay Drugstore
in about 20 minutes.

339

Now you gotta be more careful
when you call here.

340
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,247
If anybody else answers,
just use a Southern accent

341
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,833
and ask for the
vegetarian special, okay?

342
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,881
That wasn't the airline,
was it?

343
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,424
Nope, wrong number.

344
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,761
We're all out of Collins mix,
so I'm gonna make
a run for the store.

345
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,805
That's funny. I thought
I just bought some.

346
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,517
You know how that stuff,
it just goes,
so I'll be back in a jiff.

Well, why doesn't
Greg go with you?

348
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,608
Sweetie, you'll need something
in case your suitcase
doesn't show up.

349
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,568
I'm sure it'll show up.
Yeah.

You don't wanna take a chance.
You don't have a toothbrush.

Go on, sweetie.
DINA: Yeah.

352
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,619
Okay, unless you
want some privacy.

353
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,788
Why would I need privacy?

354
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,791
No, I didn't think you would.

355
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,544
Okay, let's head out.
DINA: Good.

356
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,338
Bye.

anything permanent.

I don't know.
I mean, we haven't
really discussed it,

364
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,150
but I definitely
have a feeling this is it.

365
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,362

Don't you think?

366
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,698
Absolutely.

now that we have
a second to talk,

372
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,853
I just want you to know
how much Pam means to me.

373
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,230
I know that we haven't
been together that long,

374
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,776
but the time that we have
spent together has been
really incredible.

375
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,029
Greg, how come
you don't like cats?

376
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,575
I don't not like cats.

377
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,870
(STAMMERING)
I just prefer dogs.

378
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,040
I mean, I'm just more of
a dog kind of, you know...

379
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:14,879
Come home, wagging their
little tails, happy to
see you kind of...

380
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:19,300
You need that assurance?
You prefer an
emotionally shallow animal?

381
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,719
I...

382
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,263
You see, Greg,
when you yell at a dog,

383
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,267
his tail will go between his
legs and cover his genitals,
his ears will go down.

384
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,896
A dog is very easy to break,
but cats make you
work for their affection.

385
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,190
They don't sell out
the way dogs do.

386
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,693
Huh.

to "puff the magic dragon"
means to...

505
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,509
So much love,
yet also so much information.

506
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,264
lt takes a lot out of him.

507
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,560
Greg, would you
like some yams?

508
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,145
Thank you. Yeah.

509
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:55,482
You must've had vegetables
fresher than that, growing up
on a farm, Greg.

510
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,485
Dad, Greg grew up in Detroit.

511
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,155
He told me he grew up
on a farm.

512
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,159
Do they have
many farms in Detroit?

513
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,660
No, Dina, no, not a lot.

514
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,287
ln fact, Jack,
I should clarify this.

515
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:13,083
I didn't actually grow up
on a farm, per se.

516
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,753
The house we grew up in
was originally erected

517
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,631
in the early Dutch farm,
colonial style.

518
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,134
So that,
plus we had a lot of pets...

519
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,431
Which one did you milk then?

520
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,016
Dad!

521
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,935
Honey, he said he pumped milk.

522
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,271
What have you ever milked?

523
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,442
A cat.

524
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,069
A cat?

525
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,032
I milked a cat once.
You wanna hear a story?

526
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,700
Sure.

527
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:52,539
My sister had a cat,
and the cat birthed
a litter of kittens.

528
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,210
Must've been 30 of them,
and there was
this one little runt,

529
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,797
this little sweet
little-engine-that-could runt

530
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:03,592
who wanted to get up there
and couldn't really
get access to the...

531
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,012
To the teat.

532
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,264
Teat?

533
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,266
Dad.
What have you.

534
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:15,395
I went in and just simply,
you know...

535
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,485
lnto a little saucer,

536
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:27,699
then took the saucer
and fed it to Geppetto.
That's what I named him.

537
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,869
I had no idea
you could milk a cat.

538
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,914
Yeah, you can
milk anything with nipples.

539
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,544
I have nipples, Greg.
Could you milk me?

540
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,547
Okay, could we change
the subject perhaps?

541
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,175
Champagne, champagne.
Yes.

542
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,219
I thought
maybe we could celebrate
with a little bubbly.

543
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,679
That'd be great.

544
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,013
Good idea.

545
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,024
"l have nipples.
Can you milk me?"

546
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,611
Well, in a funny way,
you've already
seen Deb's ring.

547
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,238
That's true.

548
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,869
Would anybody care for
a bottle of Oyster Bay Drug
and Sundry's finest champagne?

549
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:15,539
That is so sweet of you, Greg.
Isn't that a nice gesture?

550
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,040
That's very nice.

551
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,877
How could I have seen
Debbie's ring, Mom?

552
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,046
Well, when I gave Bob the okay
to propose to Deb,

553
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,965
I put him in touch
with my diamond guy,

554
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,968
and he picked out
the same design
Kevin gave you.

555
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,346
Kevin, your old boyfriend?

556
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,598
Thanks, Dad.

557
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,933
Well, yeah,
Kevin was Pam's fiancé.

558
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,768
(GASPS)

559
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,567
Oh, my God.

560
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:48,780
Jinxy, no!

561
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,074
PAM: Oh, God.

562
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,160
Shit.

563
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,246
Greg, sweetie, how you doing?

564
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:01,168
G REG: Just fine,
considering I desecrated
your grandma's remains,

565
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,172
found out you were engaged
and had your father ask me
to milk him.

566
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,799
At least back then
he was still talking to me.

567
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,218
I can't believe
you didn't tell me
you were that close.

568
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,678
Who, Daddy and me?

569
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,388
No, Kevin and you.

570
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,933
Do we have to know everything
about each other's pasts?

571
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,603
You never told me about
your cat-milking days
in Motown.

572
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,189
That was a long time ago, Pam.

573
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,483
Yeah, okay, well, so was this.

574
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:30,864
Kevin's and my connection
was more physical
than anything else.

575
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,952
Physical? Like what?
Like you worked out together?

576
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:40,040
No, no, it was nothing,
nothing. It was
a stupid sexual thing.

577
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,876
I'm gonna go throw up now.

578
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,795
Greg, listen.

579
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:48,966
Kevin and I were only engaged
for a month before I realized
that I'd made a mistake.

580
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,094
I gave back the ring,
I moved to Chicago,

581
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,973
and I met and fell in love
with you, okay,
so can we please drop this?

582
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,558
Okay.

583
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,643
Good.

584
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,728
I just feel like this is
not going well at all.

585
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,397
I feel like your dad hates me.

586
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,399
He doesn't hate you, sweetie.

587
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,151
Come on. Just give him
a chance, all right?

588
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,153
Maybe he's nervous too, huh?

589
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:14,157
I thought he would
love my gift, you know,
being this big flower guy,

590
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:18,203
but it's like
he didn't even show
the slightest bit of interest.

591
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:22,165
Listen to me. Forget the gift.

592
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,753
You are the most adorable,
loving, sweetest man
in the whole world,

593
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,588
and I love you.

594
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,508
And very soon my parents
are gonna see that

595
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,802
and grow to
love you too, okay?

596
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,762
Okay?

597
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:41,143
Speaking of growing
to love you...

598
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,770
Honey, it's late. Come on.
I know it's late.

599
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,690
But Mr. Winky
is still on Chicago time,

600
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:50,360
and we both know
there's only one way
to make Mr. Winky go away.

601
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,778
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

602
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,739
And there it is.

603
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,455
What's with the robe?

604
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,417
It's Pam's. My pajamas
are in the suitcase
with everything else.

605
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,503
Hey, I'll lend you
a pair of Jack's. Okay, honey?

606
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,588
Sure.

607
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,173
You don't have to
do that, Dina.
DINA: No, no, no.

608
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,050
No, that's fine. We have to.

609
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,469
Thank you.
DINA: You're welcome.

610
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,765
Look, Greg, I just wanna say,
don't worry about
what happened tonight.

611
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:24,269
Oh, thanks, Jack.
Still, I feel horrible.
I mean...

612
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,647
Well, it was a horrible thing.

613
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:34,696
But let's just put
all that behind us and
enjoy our weekend together.

614
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,408
Okay. Okay.

615
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,659
Thank you, Daddy.

00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,455

Thanks, Mom.

618

Good night, sweetie.
See you in the morning.

622
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,006
Have a nice sleep.
Okay, you too.

623
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:57,677
No, Greg, we made up
the pullout for you
down in the den.

624
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:03,016
Okay, 'cause Pam said I should
sleep in Debbie's room.

625
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,936
Well, Debbie'll be
sleeping here tomorrow.

626
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,313
This way, you'll have
more privacy, you'll have
your own bathroom.

627
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:12,150
Just try not to
flush the toilet.
It's always a little quirky.

628
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,152
Okay.

629
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,196
One more thing.

630
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,575
I'm a realist. I understand
it's the 2 1 st century,

631
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,037
and you've probably had
premarital relations
with my daughter.

632
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,416
But under our roof,
it's my way or
the Long lsland Expressway.

633
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,043
Is that understood?

00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,878

but there's just something
about him that's a little off.

we've been through this

647
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:25,098
with every boyfriend
Pam has had since,
what, middle school.

648
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,435
I think Greg...
He's a lovely young man.

649
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,689
And, honey, Pam thinks
he might be the one.

650
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,943
She said that?
She said those exact words?

651
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,280
I didn't tape record her,
Jack, but that's
the impression.

I'm worried about.

realized something.
What?

00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,887

00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,558
I heard a noise,
so I came down to see
if everything was okay.

668
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:35,562
Everything's fine. I just...
I'm sorry. I saw a light on,
and I kinda stumbled in.

669
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,688
I didn't realize...

670
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,815
That's okay.
See anything interesting?

No, not at all. I mean...

672
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:46,740
I mean, this is great, though.
I love this... What you...
It's a cozy little nook.

673
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,201
I noticed you were looking
at that when I came in.

674
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,495
Yeah.

675
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,372
It's an antique
polygraph machine.

676
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,584
Is that what that is?
I've seen these before,

677
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,919
but I never saw one
actually up close.

678
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,254
You know what?

679
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,967
Why don't you try that on?

680
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,094
Oh, that's okay.

681
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,181
Come on. We'll have some fun.
I'll show you how it works.

682
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,724
I shouldn't.

683
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,060
Why should you be afraid?
You have nothing to hide.

684
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,186
No, I know.

685
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,520
I know you know,
so there shouldn't be
any problem.

686
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,189
No, there's no problem.

687
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,024
So, try it on.

688
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,150
Okay.

689
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,943
I'll help you.

690
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,245
Don't worry.
You'll enjoy this.

691
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,792
All right.

692
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,963
Looks complicated.
Now these aren't
100% accurate, right?

693
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,131
They're...

694
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,258
You'd be surprised
how accurate they are.

695
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,387
They can tell fairly easily
if someone's lying or not.

696
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,473
Now I'm gonna ask you
some questions,

697
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,850
and all you have to do
is answer "yes" or "no".

698
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,685
Okay.
All right.

699
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,146
Let's give it a whirl.

700
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,858
Did you fly
on an airplane today?

701
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,360
Yes, I did.

702
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,779
No peeking.

703
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,865
Did we eat pot roast
for dinner tonight?

704
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,200
Yes.

705
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,619
Was it undercooked?

706
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,458
No, it was rare.

707
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,169
lt was a little rare
for my taste.

708
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,255
But I wouldn't...

709
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,798
I'm just kidding,
I'm just...

710
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,466
(BOTH LAUG HING)

711
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:33,012
Relax. Relax.
The needles are jumping.

712
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,268
Have you ever watched
pornographic videos?

713
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,192
No.

714
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,279
I mean, well, I don't...

715
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,738
Yes or no?

716
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,540
Hey!

717
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,626
Hey.

718
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,174
What's the matter?
You can't sleep?

719
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,135
No, I'm just going over
some of my answers

720
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,304
from the polygraph test
your dad gave me.

721
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,638
Oh, no, he didn't.

722
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,848
Yeah, he did.

723
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,392
Well, did you lie to him?

724
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,730
No! I mean, well,
he asked me if we were
living together and...

725
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,732
What'd you tell him?

726
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,233
Nothing. Your mother walked in

727
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,278
and yanked the little thingies
off before I had to answer.

728
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:34,699
Is this how you'd react if
I told you he shoved bamboo
shoots up my fingernails?

729
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,411
Or does he hook
all your boyfriends up
to his little machine?

730
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:42,290
Well, he doesn't
need a machine.
He's a human lie detector.

731
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,333
What?

732
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,461
Greg, my father was never
in the rare flower business.

733
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,421
That was just his cover.

734
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:52,342
He was in the C.I.A.
for 34 years.

735
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,178
How could you
not tell me this?

736
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,849
I wanted to, honey,
but it was strictly
on a need-to-know basis.

737
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:06,523
So, what? He's in the C.I.A.?
He was a spy? He is a spy?

738
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,858
No, he was more like
a psychological profiler.

739
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,612
They used him to interrogate
suspected double agents
in the company.

740
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,405
Oh, that's great. Yeah.

741
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,950
I was scared of your dad
back when I thought
he was a florist.

742
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,370
It's wonderful to know that
I've actually got a C.I.A.
spy-hunter on my ass.

743
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,748
Would you stop?
You're doing great, okay?

744
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,710
This is a lot to take in,
honey. I'm sorry.

745
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,379
It's just weird.

746
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,464
I know, but you're doing fine.

747
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,966
I promise.

748
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,685
No!
What's wrong, sweetie?

749
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,480
I forgot.
I'm not supposed to
let the snake out of my cage.

750
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,190
Your what?

751
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,859
I told your dad
I wouldn't touch you
for 72 hours.

752
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,987
Okay, I'm not in
junior high anymore, so...

753
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,196
No. Seriously.

754
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,991
I want to try to
respect his rules, okay?

755
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,243
Okay. Fine.

756
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,914
Why don't you go ahead
and get some sleep, and I'll
see you in the morning.

757
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:05,999
Okay.

758
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,464
(GASPS)

759
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,886
Morning, Greg.

760
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,389
Good morning.

761
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,476
Pam told me she let you in
on a little secret
of mine last night.

762
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,396
Yes, she did.

763
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,775
Well, as long as you can
keep your mouth shut
for the rest of your life,

764
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,736
you're in no immediate danger.

765
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,197
I won't tell.

766
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,659
I'm just being humorous.

767
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,871
That was funny.

768
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:50,168
But the fact is, Greg,
with the knowledge
you've been given,

769
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,795
you are now on the inside
of what I like to call

770
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,758
"the Byrnes family
circle of trust."

771
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,886
I keep nothing from you,
you keep nothing from me

772
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,555
and round and round we go.

773
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,600
Okay. Understood.

774
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:11,898
Okay, good. Come on.
Let's go inside
and have breakfast.

775
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,947
(SINGING)
<i>Jinxy cat, Jinxy cat,</i>
<i>where are you?</i>

776
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,241
<i>I love you</i>

777
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:26,079
JACK: Jinxy. Jinxy.

778
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,165
Not at the table,
honey, please.

779
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,125
Attaboy!

780
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,419
JACK: Hey, hey, look who's up!

781
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,797
Hi, sweetie.
You must be Greg.

782
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:36,839
Hello.

783
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,801
Look, somebody had
a visit from the hair fairy.

784
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,304
Yes.
N ice 'do, nice 'do.

785
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,766
I'll do the intros. Greg.
This is my sister, Debbie.

786
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,601
Hi. N ice to meet you.
The bride to be.

787
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,020
Congratulations.
And her fiancé, Dr. Bob.

788
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,939
You can call me Bob... M. D.

789
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,858
These are his parents,
Linda Banks...

790
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,777
Hi. How are you?
N ice to meet you.

791
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,071
And the world-famous
plastic surgeon, Dr. Larry.

792
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,365
Now, cut that out.

793
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,703
You know, Greg's in medicine,
too, Larry.

794
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,538
Really? What field?

795
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:09,831
N ursing.

796
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,083
That's good.

797
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,627
No, really. What field?

798
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,838
N ursing.

799
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,511
Hey, why don't
I get you a chair, Greg?

800
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,763
Thank you. Thanks.

801
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:29,684
So, you didn't want to
go for the M. D.?

802
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:34,021
No, I actually thought
about becoming a doctor, but
I decided it wasn't for me.

803
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,898
Just as well.
Boards are killer.

804
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,401
Actually, Greg aced his MCATs.

805
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,862
You serious?
No, I did okay.

806
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,239
He did more than okay.
Trust me.

807
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,617
Why did you take the test
if you weren't planning on
going to med school?

808
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,536
Well, I wanted to keep
my options open,

809
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,955
but in the end, nursing was
a better fit for me.

810
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,624
lt gives you the freedom
to work in several
different areas of medicine.

811
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,543
Plus, I can focus 100%
on patient care,

812
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,045
as opposed to being a doctor
where you have to
deal with the bureaucracy.

813
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,132
Uh-oh. Wasn't your friend Andy
supposed to be here by now?

814
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,925
BOB: Oh, my God!
I thought Deb told you.

815
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,303
Dr. Andy threw out his back.

816
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,722
He can't make the wedding.

817
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,975
Oh, damn.
Now I have to reconfigure
the whole procession.

818
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:14,937
Bob, why doesn't Greg stand in
for Andy, be the usher?

819
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,482
No, Pam, no.

820
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,942
That'll be fine.
Bob, Greg'll be
your second usher.

821
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,570
Good.

822
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,530
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay, sure.

823
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,325
Good. Let's all finish up
and get ready to go

824
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:30,119
because we have a pre-activity
briefing in about 32 minutes.

825
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,038
ALL: Thirty-two minutes!

826
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,791
You know what? In that case,
I'd better get upstairs

827
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,960
and pay a little visit
to the shower fairy.

828
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,717
Dina, thank you
so much for breakfast.

829
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,597
Hey, you okay?

830
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,265
Why didn't you wake me up?

831
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,226
Because I thought
you'd like to sleep late.

832
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,936
Not when I'm a guest.

833
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,480
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.
No, it's not okay.

834
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:01,025
Tell that to Dr. Torquemada
in there with
the Grand Inquisition.

835
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,486
Go take a shower, get dressed
and come back down.

836
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,071
Get dressed in what?

837
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,697
Borrow some more
of Dad's clothes.

838
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,325
No, I don't... Come on.
Why not, honey?

839
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:13,162
I just... No, I don't feel
comfortable wearing
your dad's underwear.

840
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,290
Okay, well, go wake up Denny
and borrow some of his.

841
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,417
You want me to go wake up
your brother who I never met

842
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,087
and ask if I could have
some of his clothes?

843
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,632
Okay, all right.
Where's Denny's room?

844
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,592
Top of the stairs, turn right.

845
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:41,858
Denny?

846
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,279
Hello? Hello?

847
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,295
Hey! What the hell
you doing in here?

848
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,797
Hi. I'm Greg, Pam's friend.

849
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,425
What? Were you just
sniffing my boxers, dude?

850
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:10,303
No, dude, no. No, she said
I could come up here,

851
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,888
maybe borrow
some clothes from you.

852
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,222
Do me a favor. Close the door.

853
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,682
Okay.
Quick.

854
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,477
Tell anybody I wasn't here?

855
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,479
No, they think you're asleep.

856
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,273
Yeah, so, it's all good.

857
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,066
You scared me.

858
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,160
Dad keeps you guys under
a pretty close watch, huh?

859
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,120
No, it's not that bad.

860
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:39,540
Your little Pamcake's
got it a lot worse than I do.

861
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,126
You need some clothes.

862
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,503
Yes, that would be great.

863
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,715
Glad to hook you up.
All right?
Cool.

864
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,343
Like what you done
with the crib.

865
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,638
Lil' Kim.

866
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,098
She's phat.

867
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,271
P-H, phat.

868
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,941
Yeah, I think these ought to
do it. All right,
here you go, chief.

869
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,984
All right!
Enjoy!

870
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,819
Thanks a lot, Denny.
No problem.

871
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:12,782
And don't worry about
the little covert op,
all right?

872
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,533
I'll keep it on the lowdown.
Down low.

873
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,868
No doubt.

874
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,788
(JACK lMlTATING A TRUMPET)

875
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:21,624
People, people, come get
your revised itineraries.

876
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:25,878
Larry, Linda, Debbie,
Bob, honey.

877
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:30,049
Now, I'm gonna activate
the alarm. It'll go off
in T minus 16 seconds.

878
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,093
I don't think I need a jacket.

879
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:34,011
It's cold out, honey. Hold on.

880
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,097
Here, take Denny's jacket.

881
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,644
Hey, Denny, I'm lending Greg
your jacket, okay?

882
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,646
Whatever.
Let's go.

883
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,745
Denny, how's the tux fit?

884
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,163
Dad...

885
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,289
What's that?

886
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,335
It's a sculpture
I found in Greg's jacket.

887
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,174
This isn't a sculpture, Denny.
This is a device
for smoking marijuana.

888
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,052
Really?

889
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:20,266
Not mine. It's not.

890
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,229
Hey, Jack. How you doing?

891
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,651
I like the top hat.
Complements you.

892
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,404
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

893
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,577
Sit down.

894
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:47,793
Did I not clearly explain
the circle of trust
to you, Greg?

895
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,463
Yeah, I think I got it.

896
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,591
Then is there something
you wanna tell me?

897
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,843
I don't think so.

898
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,513
Didn't we have
a discussion yesterday
in the car about this?

899
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,516
Yes! You mean...Yes!

900
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,894
You mean me and Pam.
Yes, I would love to
talk to you about that.

901
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,813
We're not talking about Pam.
We're talking about you.

902
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,941
See, if I can't trust you,
Greg, then I have no choice

903
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,902
but to put you right back
outside the circle.

904
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:16,030
And once you're out,
you're out.
There's no coming back.

905
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:21,285
Well, I would definitely like
to stay inside the circle.

906
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,329
Well, then, tell me the truth.

907
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,498
Okay.

908
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,338
Jack, I don't know
what we're talking about.

909
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,841
All right, now look, Focker,
I'm a patient man.

910
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:39,261
That's what 19 months
in a Vietnamese prison camp
will do to you.

911
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:43,516
But I will be watching you,
studying your every move.

912
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:47,937
And if I find that you are
trying to corrupt
my firstborn child,

913
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,772
I will bring you down, baby.

914
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:52,066
I will bring you down
to Chinatown.

915
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,126
Where are we?
I thought we were going
to Kevin's house.

916
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,879
We are, sweetie.
This is Kevin's new house.

917
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,047
PAM: Wow!

918
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,299
LARRY: This is a crazy house.

919
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,218
BOB: Not bad, huh, Dad?

920
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:24,890
Maybe he uses marijuana
for medicinal purposes.
People do that nowadays.

921
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,351
Honey, this kid
has been lying to us
from the moment we met him.

922
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:29,979
Hey, you.
Get in some quality time
with the boys?

923
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,397
Yeah, it was fun.

924
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,067
Listen, I hope this lunch
isn't too weird for you.

925
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:39,113
Why would "B. B. Q.
at Best Man's" be weird?

926
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,408
Oh, my God, Greg.
I was sure I told you.

927
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,327
Kevin is Bob's best man.
This is his place.

928
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,329
G REG: Kevin, your ex-fiancé?

929
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,539
ALL: Hey!

930
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:49,707
Welcome, everybody.

931
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,668
I don't understand.
How does he know Bob?

932
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:59,508
Well, they went to
lacrosse camp together,

933
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,595
and Kevin was the one
who introduced Bob to Debbie.

934
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,305
Lacrosse camp?

935
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,850
I was really lucky I was able
to salvage this wood

936
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,144
from an old seamen's
chapel in Nantucket.

937
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,353
(ALL GASPING)

938
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,438
Wow!

939
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,690
Kevin, the house is amazing.
This is where
the light comes in.

940
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,358
Maybe you should have
gotten married here.

941
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,737
All right, the sun is out,
the grill is hot,
and the pool is luke.

942
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:23,365
If I can interest you
in a swim and a little B. B. Q.,
just follow me.

943
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,367
All right, Kevo.
Right on schedule.

944
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,535
Wow.
Bring it on.

945
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,162
lt must cost a fortune
to heat this place.

946
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,623
KEVl N: Wait till you see
the rest of the house.

947
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,351
You okay, sweetie?
Yeah.

948
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,937
I'm really sorry.
I don't know why
I thought you knew.

949
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,897
It's not a big deal.

950
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,566
If I can handle
a weekend without
sex and cigarettes,

951
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:01,237
I think I can handle
an afternoon
with your ex-fiancé.

952
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,988
Okay. Thank you.

953
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,742
Now, for the floor that
you're walking on, I chose
this Bolivian wormwood.

954
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,410
I think it works well in here.

955
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,747
I have the Viking range here
and the twin Sub-Z's.

956
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,832
Yeah, they open up
right there.

957
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,751
Oh, I get it. Like hidden.

958
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,211
Yeah, kind of blend in.

959
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:18,504
Great.

960
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,381
Are you a homeowner, Greg?

961
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,508
No, no, I rent.

962
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,763
So, things are going real,
real well for you,
aren't they Kevo?

963
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,890
Gosh, things have been going
so great lately.

964
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,309
I got in early
on some wireless I. P. O.s,

965
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,353
and the stuff just
skyrocketed from there.

966
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:35,854
Wow.

967
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,232
What about you, Greg?
What line of work are you in?

968
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,901
I'm in health care.
Yeah, so you know
what I'm talking about.

969
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,862
There are a lot of Benjamins
to be made now
with biotech stuff.

970
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,448
I don't have to tell you that.
How's your portfolio?

971
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,368
I'd say strong

972
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,413
to quite strong.

973
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,291
You gotta strike
while the iron's hot.

974
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,709
Now's the time.

975
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,336
Greg's a male nurse.

976
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,297
That's right. Thank you, Jack.

977
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:05,092
Well, that's great.
That's great to give
something back like that.

978
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,678
I'd love to find time
to do volunteer work.

979
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,389
Just the other day
I saw this golden retriever
that...

980
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,766
He had like a gimp,
and he couldn't really...

981
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,311
lt made me feel terrible.
I wish there was
something I could do.

982
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:19,064
Yeah, well, I get paid,
but also it feels,
you know, good too.

983
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,066
So it's kind of
an everybody wins.

984
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:24,153
What are you? You're like
a Wall Street trader?

985
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,654
An investment guy?
No.

986
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,614
I mean, I'm willing to be
painted with that brush.

987
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,700
Yes, that's my day job.

988
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,953
We have time?
We got time, don't we, Jack?

989
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:36,290
I want to show you what
I'm really interested in.
Come on. Let's go.

990
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:41,670
Wow!

991
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,881
lt looks like somebody
got an "A" in wood shop.

992
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:48,969
Yeah, it's always been kind of
a hobby. I whittled that out
of beech wood.

993
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,055
It's beautiful.
Yeah.

994
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:54,224
So what got you into
"carpentering"?
Carpentry?

995
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,977
I guess I'd have to say Jesus.

996
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:01,815
He was a carpenter, and l
just figured if you're gonna
follow in someone's footsteps,

997
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,233
who better than Christ?

998
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,239
Greg's Jewish.

999
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,117
Are you?
Yeah.

1000
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:17,081
Well, so was J. C.
Wow. You're in good company.

1001
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,209
Right.

1002
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,087
Well, I'm gonna
head to the pool,

1003
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,589
but why don't you show
Greg and Pam the gift?

1004
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,093
G REG: Wow, he made a gift.
PAM: Greg.

1005
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,720
Now, I put a fresh coat
of lacquer on this
this morning,

1006
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,806
so bear with me
with the fumes.

1007
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,644
Wow. Kev.

1008
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,604
Isn't that something?

1009
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:41,814
That's incredible.

1010
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,148
Thank you.

1011
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,400
Roses. Deb's favorite.

1012
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,901
Yes, right.
It's beautiful.

1013
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,486
PAM: The little holes
are for candles.

1014
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,988
KEVl N: Well, exactly.
And then later,
they'll collect rainfall.

1015
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,032
They make a tiny birdbath.

1016
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,367
That's great.

1017
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:56,495
It's beautiful. What is it?

1018
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,705
It's an altar.

1019
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,291
Or you might call it
a chuppah.

1020
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,879
Isn't that sweet? Wow.

1021
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,006
I'm gonna take it over
to the Byrneses',

1022
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:12,136
and tomorrow Robert and
Deborah will meet beneath it
to become man and wife.

1023
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,680
And later, when they
purchase a home,

1024
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,057
maybe it will grace
their garden.

1025
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:20,853
Well, that's my sappy,
romantic idea.

1026
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,608
Must have taken
forever to build.

1027
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,527
No, not too bad.
About 70 hours.

1028
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:32,865
Which isn't bad, considering
I carved it all by hand
from one piece of wood.

1029
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,826
JACK ON I NTERCOM: Hey, Kevo.

1030
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,954
<i>12: 15. Time to start</i>
<i>the barbecue, big guy.</i>

1031
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:42,249
Okay, Mr. B.
I better get back
to playing host.

1032
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,419
Okay, you guys, grab
your suits, and I'll meet you
down at the pool.

1033
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,671
You know, I think I'm gonna
take a pass on the swimming.

1034
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:48,922
Oh, no, you can't.

1035
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:52,009
I don't even have
a suit with me.
The airline lost my bag and...

1036
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,636
<i>Pamcake, let's go.</i>
<i>Mom's got your suit here.</i>

1037
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:55,888
Coming, Dad.

1038
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,890
You better get going.

1039
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:02,060
Gosh, she's great.
Congratulations, man.

1040
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,312
Thank you.

1041
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:07,232
And, by the way,
she just had the nicest
things to say about you.

1042
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,151
Really?

1043
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,319
Yeah.

1044
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,528
(SIGHS)

1045
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,532
Gosh. Yeah, we had
some good times together.

1046
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,076
Boy, she is a tomcat.

1047
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,585
So, let me hook you up
with some trunks, Gregger.

1048
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,794
I'm not gonna swim.

1049
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:30,005
No, come on.
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

1050
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:33,842
KEVl N: Cold buffet is
on the left, wine
and champagne on the right.

1051
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,719
Coming through here.

1052
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,149
Yeah, that'd be gre...

1053
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,027
Hey, there he is!
Get out here.

1054
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:57,115
G-man, we got salmon,
we got swordfish.
What's it gonna be?

1055
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:02,371
How about a little of both,
K-Dog? I'm pretty hungry.

1056
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:06,124
I think they call that
"the munchies."

1057
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,629
JACK: Let's go. Hit the ball,
Kev! Show them what you got!

1058
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:14,258
(ALL CH EERING)

1059
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,515
KEVl N: Come on, Greg. Damn!

1060
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,475
Come on, team.
He's got nothing.
Come on, Greg.

1061
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,894
Service.
Come on, Greg.

1062
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,145
(ALL SCREAMING)

1063
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,899
N ice serve, pal.

1064
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,360
KEVl N: All right.

1065
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:34,820
Set!

1066
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,740
Oh, Greg! Come on!

1067
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:42,035
N ice shot, Maverick!
Sweet setup, lceman.

1068
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,579
N ice one, N urse.

1069
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,080
KEVl N: Glenn, Glenn, Glenn.

1070
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,499
You gotta rush the net
on defense.
Don't be afraid of the ball.

1071
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,793
It's Greg.
H uddle up, team.

1072
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,504
Greg, not Glenn.
Greg is afraid of the ball.

1073
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,381
Come on. This is unacceptable.

1074
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,924
He's gotta go for the ball.

1075
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,634
Here's what we gotta do.

1076
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,511
KEVl N: Let's go!
We're getting cold in here.

1077
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:00,887
We're getting creamed.

1078
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,515
If Florence N ightingale
over here would play defense.

1079
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:04,933
Larry, I missed one shot.

1080
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,602
lt was a big shot.

1081
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,937
Larry, keep floating
where you are.
You're doing great.

1082
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,439
Denny, take the deep shots.
Okay.

1083
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,232
Greg, nobody's expecting
much out of you,

1084
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,610
so if I set you up
with the ball, can you
jump up and spike it?

1085
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,694
No.

1086
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,696
Yeah. I'd have to be
pretty high, but yeah.

1087
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,323
I bet you would, Panama Red.

1088
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,160
All right, everybody,
look sharp. Break!
Let's play some ball.

1089
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:26,079
PAM: All right, here we go.
Let's go. Come on.

1090
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,501
Greg! Set!

1091
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:36,423
You gotta spike those, Focker!
You gotta spike those!

1092
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:39,217
Look how Bob did that.
N ice play, Bob.
Thanks, Jack.

1093
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,762
Fire it up there, Focker!
Let's do it!

1094
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,556
Way to go, Deb!
JACK: Greg!

1095
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,229
Honey! God!

1096
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,029
What the hell's
the matter with you?
It's only a game, Focker!

1097
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,823
Oh, honey! I'm coming!

1098
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,701
Get some ice.

1099
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,787
My eye! Oh, my eye!

1100
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:07,871
Focker!

1101
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,207
God!

1102
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,380
JACK: Pam, help your sister,
please.
I'm sorry, Deb.

1103
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:19,716
Deb, you can totally see
Voit backwards
on your forehead.

1104
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,968
Denny, get outta here!
You the bandleader?

1105
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,804
Yes, sir.
Go over the song selection
with Bob.

1106
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,681
Bob? Bob!
Yeah, Jack.

1107
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,684
Are you a Mr. Focker?
Yes.

1108
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,519
Okay. Sign here, please.

1109
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,270
Great. Thank you.

1110
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:45,659
Hey, your suitcase.
You go through it,
make sure it's all there?

1111
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:47,285
Yeah, it's fine.
Good.

1112
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,370
What's up?

1113
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:54,251
I just wanna make sure you're
okay since hitting the spike
heard around the world.

1114
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,878
Oh, yeah. I'm really sorry
about that.
It's okay.

1115
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:59,673
I don't know what
got into me, lceman.

1116
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,466
"lceman"?

1117
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,677
I'm sorry. ls that
a special thing between
you and Kevin?

1118
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:06,513
Stop it.
Stop what, lceman?

1119
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:09,307
<i>Top Gun was</i>
a very popular movie
when Kevin and I dated.

1120
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,559
All right? That's it.

1121
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,602
Hey, lceman.
I have no problem with that.

1122
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:16,773
Do you want to be Maverick?
Is that what
this is all about?

1123
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,316
I can't be Maverick.
Kevin's Maverick.

1124
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,111
He used to be,
but we can change that.

1125
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,780
Can he be Goose?

1126
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,324
No, because Goose
dies in the end.

1127
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,161
Very sad.

1128
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,331
Honey, I don't really...
Greg, shut up.

1129
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,041
Okay.

1130
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,972
Jesus, Dad,
you ever think of knocking?

1131
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,390
Not in my own den.

1132
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,767
What are you two
doing in here?

1133
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,852
I'd say rounding second base.

1134
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,315
This is Greg's room, Dad.

1135
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:00,442
Not anymore.
We're gonna use it
for storage.

1136
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:03,445
Greg will stay in
Debbie's room, and she'll
bunk up with you tonight.

1137
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:04,821
Fine. Come on, Greg.

1138
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,783
Okay. I'll be right up.
I'll meet you upstairs.

1139
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:10,619
Oh, good.
They found your suitcase.

1140
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:11,912
Yeah.

1141
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:16,500
Hey, Jack, I don't quite know
what happened back
at the tux shop,

1142
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:20,295
but if I've given you
the wrong impression regarding
Pam in any way, I'm sorry.

1143
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:24,758
Okay? I have nothing but
the best intentions
with Pam, and I just...

1144
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:28,178
Actually, there's something
in the suitcase here that I'm
planning on giving her

1145
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:30,430
that I think symbolizes

1146
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,519
the level of
my commitment to her.

1147
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:41,566
And I wouldn't feel right
asking her to wear it without
her father's permission.

1148
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,361
Jack?

1149
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,239
Did you flush this toilet?

1150
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,909
Maybe. You know what?
Maybe Jinx flushed it.

1151
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,161
I saw little Jinxy
come in last night,

1152
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,039
and he took a little squat
and relieved himself.

1153
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,918
Jinx knows not to
use that toilet, and even if
he did, he'd never flush it.

1154
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,004
What does it matter?
The matter, Greg, R. N.,

1155
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,340
is that when this toilet
is flushed, it runs,

1156
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,676
and when you have
a septic tank
that's nearly full

1157
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,511
and a toilet that's been
running all night,

1158
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,137
then you could have
a hell of a problem.

1159
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:13,431
Mr. Byrnes?

1160
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,142
MAN: This is not part of
my job description.

1161
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,728
N ice stench.
You're really on
a roll there, bud.

1162
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:20,605
Bite me, Denny!

1163
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:25,277
ln 20 hours, I'm having
a wedding here, so I need
my cesspool pumped now!

1164
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,862
Not tomorrow. Now!

1165
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,488
Dad, what's going on?

1166
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,033
Oh, my God!
What's that smell?

1167
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,119
That smell, Bob, is our shit.

1168
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,581
Focker flushed the toilet
in the den, so the septic tank
is overflowing.

1169
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,833
Jack, I told you.
lt wasn't me. It was Jinx.

1170
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,210
Focker, I'm not
gonna tell you again!

1171
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,505
Jinx cannot flush the toilet.
He's a cat, for chrissakes!

1172
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:48,508
The animal doesn't even
have thumbs, Focker.

1173
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,804
Hey, look at this!
Kevo!

1174
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,973
Over by the tree, right?

1175
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,146
No. No, no, no.
Not on the lawn!

1176
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,732
Stay where you are.
Not on the lawn!

1177
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:06,985
PAM: Kevin, no!
No, no, no, no!

1178
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,575
No, no, no!

1179
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,201
What the heck?

1180
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,623
(MAN SINGING)
<i>I got my mojo workin'</i>

1181
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,709
<i>Just won't work on you</i>

1182
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,963
<i>I got my mojo workin'</i>

1183
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,717
<i>Just won't work on you</i>

1184
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:35,096
I know that's what
I said I wanted,
'cause that's what I wanted.

1185
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,640
lt is a black
Samsonite suitcase.

1186
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:40,185
What I'm saying is,
do you think it's possible
that the Samsonite people,

1187
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:44,272
in some crazy little scheme
to actually turn a profit,
made more than one?

1188
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,483
<i>WOMAN: I don't think so.</i>
You don't?

1189
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:49,611
<i>I am going to need your</i>
<i>baggage claim number again.</i>

1190
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:50,987
Jinx, stop.

1191
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,036
I know I signed for it.

1192
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,330
<i>I'm looking at your</i>
<i>signature right here,</i>
<i>Mr. Focker.</i>

1193
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,290
Do me a favor. Could I talk
to your supervisor?

1194
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,375
<i>Excuse me?</i>

1195
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:47,836
What's your name?
<i>Joy.</i>

1196
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,546
Okay, let me
talk to your supervisor.

1197
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,256
<i>My supervisor is on a break.</i>

1198
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,342
When he gets back,
have him give
me a call right away.

1199
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,386
It's a very important bag.
<i>I'm sure it is, sir.</i>

1200
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:02,726
Jinx.

1201
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:07,480
Don't ask me what it's for.
I need you to do this thing.

1202
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:10,316
Please, I'm in
a time situation here,
so just do it. I'll hold on.

1203
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,693
MAN:
<i>So the name's "Greg Focker"?</i>

1204
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:14,112
I don't know. Greg or Gregory.
Run both names.

1205
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:17,407
Jinx.

1206
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:20,535
Come on. No. Jinx.
Come here. Jinxy.

1207
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:24,039
Mew, mew, mew. No. No.

1208
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,583
Jinx. Oh, shit.

1209
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:31,004
Greg didn't ace his
med school boards. He never
even took the goddamn MCATs.

1210
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,799
Oh, Jack, that's what you had
your sources check out?

1211
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,719
What this poor boy
did on some test scores?

1212
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,555
I bet he doesn't even have
a real nursing degree.

1213
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:41,973
A lot of these
hospital workers

1214
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,726
are just pill poppers
looking for easy access
to ludes.

1215
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,562
We already know that
he's been puffing
the magic dragon.

1216
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:49,981
I knew the little crack
was lying.

1217
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,861
Jinxy. Come here.
Come here, little Jinxy.

1218
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,954
(SINGING)
<i>Jinxy cat,</i>
<i>Jinxy cat I won't hurt you</i>

1219
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:11,544
The fact is, Greg lied to you.

1220
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,254
He did not lie to me, Dad.

1221
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,632
He lied to you
and I thought you
should know the truth.

1222
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:18,051
I love you too much
to see you get hurt.

1223
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:22,639
I don't care what your
information says, Dad.
Greg took the MCATs. Okay?

1224
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,945
(SPEAKING IN THAI)

1225
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:28,163
Holy...

1226
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:31,124
Shit!

1227
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,600
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1228
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:54,606
No!

1229
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:00,278
Ho...

1230
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,157
Holy...

1231
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,410
No! Oh! Oh, my God!

1232
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:09,537
All right, everybody.
All right, stand back.

1233
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,040
Stay back. Stay back.

1234
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:14,042
Watch out. Watch out!

1235
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:16,252
DINA: Oh, Jack! Oh, God!

1236
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:23,009
LARRY: We've got a fire!
Somebody call 911 right away!
H urry up!

1237
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,642
DINA: Jinxy! Jinxy!

1238
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:34,354
We checked every yard,
every car on the street.
Nobody's seen him.

1239
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:36,397
He's not up in
any of the trees, Jack.

1240
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,399
We checked all the bedrooms.
Jinx isn't up here.

1241
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:40,568
Yeah, none of the neighbors
have seen him either.

1242
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,404
You tried to milk him,
didn't you,
you sick son of a bitch!

1243
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,282
Dad, stop it. That's enough.

1244
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:47,909
Honey, please calm down.

1245
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:50,912
How can I calm down
if we're 15 minutes away
from the wedding rehearsal

1246
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:52,413
and the ring bearer's missing?

1247
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:53,998
What do you mean,
"the ring bearer"?

1248
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,625
Your daddy didn't tell you?

1249
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,795
He taught Jinx to walk down
the aisle with this
little pillow.

1250
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:00,922
Oh, no. No, you didn't, Dad.

1251
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:04,425
Yeah, yeah. You put this
around the neck, and these
ribbons are for the rings.

1252
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,010
BOB: That's adorable, Jack.

1253
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,471
Oh, for chrissakes!
That's great, Dad.

1254
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:10,765
Yeah, but now we have to
postpone the rehearsal.

1255
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:13,434
Bob, you ride with me.
Larry, you come with your car.

1256
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,812
We're gonna canvass
the neighborhood.
Dee, ask O'Boyle to wait.

1257
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:19,065
If we're not back in an hour,
we'll reschedule the rehearsal
for the morning.

1258
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:21,401
Jack!
No! We cannot
cancel the rehearsal

1259
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:22,777
for some stupid cat!

1260
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:27,198
Stupid cat? How could you
say that? That cat's been
like a brother to you!

1261
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:31,536
We're supposed to let him
wander the streets without
food, water or toilet?

1262
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,999
Dad, Greg'll find him.
What?

1263
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,292
Yeah, what?

1264
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:38,918
Oh, that's wonderful.

1265
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:44,465
Fine. Fine. Okay. Denny?

1266
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,801
Denny? Denny? Denny!
Dad, I'm right here.

1267
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:50,138
Okay. You're gonna fill in
as the ring bearer for now.

1268
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:52,432
No. I'm not wearin'
that stupid pillow thing
on my head.

1269
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:54,350
Oh, yes, you damn well will!

1270
01:11:56,353 --> 01:12:01,316
Jinx! Jinx! Here, Jinx.

1271
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:06,237
You just go and wander
the streets without food,
water or toilet? Fucker!

1272
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,284
Actually, you may be in luck.

1273
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:14,037
They brought in a Himalayan
a little while ago.

1274
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:16,873
There he is.

1275
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,917
Holy shit, that's Jinx.

1276
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,879
Jinxy!
No, let me see
that photo again.

1277
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:25,256
You gotta picture him
without that stupid Santa cap.

1278
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:27,133
Come on, Jinxy. Jinxy!

1279
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:28,343
No.

1280
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:33,014
You see, in the picture,
your cat has
an all-black tail.

1281
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:34,057
Yeah.

1282
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,059
And this one has a white tip.

1283
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:39,103
No, I'm sorry about that,
chief.

1284
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:43,274
Looks just like him.
Almost.

1285
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:45,735
Except for that tail.

1286
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,290
Dearly beloved...

1287
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,961
PRIEST: Dearly beloved,

1288
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:07,632
we are gathered here
on this beautiful day

1289
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:10,343
to join Dr. Robert Banks...

1290
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:17,683
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here
on this beautiful day

1291
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:22,814
to join Dr. Robert Banks
and Deborah Byrnes
in holy matrimony.

1292
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,857
This is a special day...

1293
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:52,009
He found him!

1294
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:55,555
It's him! It's him!

1295
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:57,140
I gotta see this.

1296
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:03,187
Look, Dad, it's Jinx.
My little baby!

1297
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:05,731
We found you. We found you.

1298
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:07,692
Greg, thank you so much.
This is so great.

1299
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,068
DEBBIE: Where did you
find him?

1300
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,695
Gave us a little scare, huh?

1301
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:13,865
Jinxy.

1302
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:29,297
<i>For once in my life</i>
<i>I got someone who needs me</i>

1303
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:32,425
To Greg.
Hooray!

1304
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:34,260
DINA: Honey, where is Greg,
anyway?

1305
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:35,720
He's in the restroom.

1306
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:39,682
Yes, I tried there.
I've tried every shelter
on the north shore, okay?

1307
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:44,187
He's a brown-and-black
Himalayan with
an all-black tail.

1308
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:49,442
Mr. Jinx. Yeah, okay.
You go check.
I'll call you back.

1309
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:54,113
It's the man of the hour.
Hey!

1310
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:58,075
Sorry, folks.
Had to pay a little visit
to the urinal fairy.

1311
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:06,459
Greg, nice work
with the cat today.

1312
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:08,878
Thanks, Jack.
I'm just glad
I could help out.

1313
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:12,173
We never did get to finish
that little "convo"
back at the den.

1314
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:15,468
So, when you have a minute,
there is still something I'd
like to talk to you about.

1315
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:18,971
We'll get right to it
as soon as we get back.
You have my word.

1316
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:21,641
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Circle of trust.

1317
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,352
Guess who's back
in the circle of trust.

1318
01:15:37,282 --> 01:15:38,950
(MEOWING)

1319
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:47,542
<i>Pull the string</i>
<i>and I'll wink at you</i>

1320
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:49,418
<i>I'm your puppet</i>

1321
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,087
Look at Jack!

1322
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:56,425
Oh, poor Kevin looks lonely.

1323
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,638
Maybe I should ask him
to dance. What do you think?

1324
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:05,101
Sure. I bet he could whittle
a private little dance floor
for the two of you.

1325
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:06,894
I'm serious.

1326
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:09,772
I saw some beech wood outside.
He's very handy.

1327
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:14,277
He's an extremely handy
and crafty craftsman.

1328
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,571
I shouldn't paint him
with that brush, but...

1329
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:21,492
Come on. Seriously. Seriously.
Part of you wishes
you ended up with him.

1330
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,619
Yes, he's very talented,

1331
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,664
but it would've
never worked out.

1332
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,207
Why not?

1333
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,127
I was never in love
with Kevin.

1334
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:37,341
I'm in love with you.

1335
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,595
That's a good explanation.

1336
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:41,762
Think so?

1337
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:42,847
Thought you'd like that.

1338
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:43,973
I do.

1339
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:45,600
I'm glad.

1340
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:50,438
No, Jinx. Mr. Jinx.
I called you like
half an hour ago.

1341
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,733
Okay, I already...

1342
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:56,527
I already described it...
Airline.

1343
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,446
Messages.

1344
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:02,700
It's brown...

1345
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:07,413
With a little bit
of black trim.

1346
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:08,873
Yes.

1347
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,042
<i>MAN: Please enter your</i>

1348
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:17,590
<i>Jack, hi. It's Hank MacAtee</i>

1349
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:20,801
<i>You'll never guess who</i>

1350
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:24,138
<i>Yeah, he's not wearing</i>

1351
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:27,308

1352
01:17:27,392 --> 01:17:29,477

1353
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:31,729
Okay, well, if you could just
keep checking, please,

1354
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,231
and I'll call you back later.
Thanks.

1355
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:38,110
Any luck?
No, they're still looking.

1356
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:41,072
Hey, Jack,
this is a great party.

1357
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:43,407
I guess sometimes these things
sort of come together

1358
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,618
in their own kooky
sort of way.

1359
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,412
Yeah, it's kind of like
the way you found Jinxy.

1360
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:50,665
You found him
at that animal shelter?

1361
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,208
Yeah, right.

1362
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:54,919
Well, the important thing is
he's home now.

1363
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,253
Yes.

1364
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,215
Yeah. You know,
there's something about
that ball of fur

1365
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:01,258
that just puts
a big smile on my face.

1366
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:02,593
Yeah.

1367
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,096
You haven't seen any of his
latest tricks, have you?

1368
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,263
No.

1369
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:09,141
Well, when we get back,
I'll show you.

1370
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:12,728
We don't have to do it
tonight. He's had a long day.
He's probably tired.

1371
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:15,648
I wouldn't want to...
No, I think he'd like to
show you tonight.

1372
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:21,696
Why don't you give me the key
and let me drive?

1373
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,489
Hey, Larry. You know what?
Why don't I drive?

1374
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:25,700
Oh. It's a very expensive car.
Good idea.

1375
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:27,827
I've always wanted to
test-drive a Benz.

1376
01:18:27,911 --> 01:18:29,578
Be my guest, Focker.

1377
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:32,790
Hey, sweetie,
what are you doing?

1378
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,709
Larry said I could drive.

1379
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:40,840
Let's go. H urry, hurry.

1380
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:42,383
All right. Bye, guys. See you.

1381
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:44,301
Thanks for driving.

1382
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:47,138
(Tl RES SCREECHING)

1383
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:50,766
Drives a little better
than your Taurus, huh, Greg?

1384
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:51,892
Yeah.

1385
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:54,270
Come on. Get in the car,
honey. Let's go. H urry up.

1386
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:55,604
Okay, okay.

1387
01:18:57,482 --> 01:18:59,316
Whoa, Nellie!

1388
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:01,861
LARRY: Everybody comfortable
back there?

(BRAKES SCREECHING)

1390
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:07,450
You're a real wild man
at that wheel there.

1391
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:12,830
You got your seat belts
on back there?
Get your seat belts on.

1392
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,712
Oh, Jesus, Focker!

1393
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:24,425
You're driving like a maniac!
Focker, take it easy!

1394
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:26,302
Benz drives like a dream, Lar.

1395
01:19:26,386 --> 01:19:28,012
Let's not make it
a nightmare, huh?

1396
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:32,683
Oh, there's Jack.

1397
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:36,687
Hey, Jackie.

(BOTH ENG I N ES REVVING)

Wanna play, Pops? Let's play.

1400
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:51,452
Okay, now, Greg? Greg?

1401
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:53,037
Greg, no!

1402
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,545
Is everything okay, honey?

1403
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,923
Yeah, just trying
to make good time.

1404
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:07,134
What the heck
is the matter with you?

1405
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,470
All right. We're gonna
be home. We're gonna get home.

1406
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,313
It's not the autobahn.
Come on, Greg!

1407
01:20:23,693 --> 01:20:24,819
Jesus!

1408
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,737
Ll N DA: Maybe you should drive
after all, honey.

1409
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,113
We're okay.

1410
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:35,496
All right.

1411
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,755
Oh, no. No, please.

1412
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:49,760
Yes!
BOB: Jack just turned.

1413
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:53,222
You were supposed to
make that left at the light,

1414
01:20:53,306 --> 01:20:54,640
Focker.

1415
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,434
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1416
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,770
DEN NY: Where does he think
he's going?

1417
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:03,607
BOB: Home, home, home.
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

1418
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,568
Who gave him the keys?

1419
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:08,070
Okay, we're out.

1420
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:09,655
Yeah, we've had
enough excitement.

1421
01:21:09,739 --> 01:21:11,365
LARRY: I wonder if he
has a license.

1422
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:13,325
BOB: Yeah, a license to kill.

1423
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:19,790
Come on, everybody.

1424
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,876
Hey, nice driving, Mario!

1425
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:24,295
You're a lunatic!

1426
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:26,964
Come on, Linda!

1427
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,632
Hey, hey!

1428
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,806
(DEBBIE SCREAMING)

1429

LARRY: What in the world...
Oh, my...

1430
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,771
Oh, the dress!

1431
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,773
lt was the cat! Goddamn you!

1432
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:47,318
Dad, Dad!
Jinx, I'm gonna...

1433
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:49,028
Calm down!

1434
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:50,738
JACK: Where's the cat?

1435
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:52,740
BOB: Cat got out!
Cat got out, Jack!

1436
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:04,793
You spray-painted his tail
to make him look like
Jinxy didn't you, Focker?

1437
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:08,005
Greg, what's he
talking about?

1438
01:22:08,214 --> 01:22:11,884
Hank MacAtee called me
a couple of hours ago
and told me he found Jinxy.

1439
01:22:11,968 --> 01:22:14,428
He took his collar
and put it on an impostor.

1440
01:22:14,512 --> 01:22:17,932
Then he spray-painted
his tail, and then he tried to
beat us back here

1441
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,975
so that he could get rid
of the evidence.

1442
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,644
Oh, no.

1443
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:26,690
Please tell me
that's not true, Greg.

1444
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:31,779
lt was just a temporary
solution until I could find
the real Jinx.

1445
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:37,326
How could you do
something like that?

1446
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:40,621
I'm sorry.
What are you going to
tell me next?

1447
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:43,207
That you set Kevin's
altar on fire?

1448
01:22:46,169 --> 01:22:47,544
Oh, my God.

1449
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:53,676
Well, it wasn't intentional.
I was chasing Jinx up
onto the roof.

1450
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,971
I had a smoke,
and I think I might have
lit something that...

1451
01:22:58,473 --> 01:22:59,682
I don't know what happened.

1452
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:02,810
He put so much goddamn lacquer
on that thing.

1453
01:23:02,894 --> 01:23:05,062
lt was an accident
waiting to happen.

1454
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:07,773
This is very
disappointing, Greg.

1455
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:14,863
Get out of my house, Focker,
and take your friend with you.

1456
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,826
So you lied to me
about everything, huh, Greg?

1457
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:21,787
You lied about the cat,
about the fire,
about the MCATs.

1458
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:25,124
I didn't lie about the MCATs.
Don't you see
what's happening here?

1459
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:27,001
Your dad has
totally turned you against me.

1460
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:28,836
I didn't turn her against you.

1461
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,421
You did that to yourself.

1462
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:35,801
Jack, please. You didn't
like me from the second
I walked in here.

1463
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,595
I'm a very accepting person,
Focker.

1464
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,764
All I ask for is honesty.

1465
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:42,599
Oh, honesty?

1466
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:46,520
You wanna talk
about truth and honesty, Jack?

1467
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:51,275
Okay, let's talk a little
truth and honesty. Let's talk
a little "Operation Ko Samui,"

1468
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:55,571
Jack.
What's he talking about, Dad?

1469
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:57,322
Yeah, that's weird,

1470
01:23:57,407 --> 01:24:00,284
because I thought there
weren't any secrets inside
the circle of trust, Jack.

1471
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:02,244
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1472
01:24:02,328 --> 01:24:03,579
You don't?

1473
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:05,914
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

1474
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:07,416
Hey, Pam, guess what.

1475
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:11,545
Daddy's planning a little
covert operation in Thailand
for the day after the wedding.

1476
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,338
You are?

1477
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,091
Round and round we go, Jack.

1478
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,510
Hey, I bet everybody would
love to hear about
your rendezvous

1479
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:20,721
in the parking lot of
the Oyster Bay Drug
and Sundry.

1480
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:22,139
You know what
I'm talking about.

1481
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:24,558
Where the guy gave you
the passports
and the documents.

1482
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:26,977
Or how about your
little phone call in Thai?

1483
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:29,396
Jack can't talk Thai.

1484
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:33,692
Oh, no, Dina. Jack can
talk Thai. Jack talk
Thai very well.

1485
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:37,321
I'm sorry, Pam,
but your dad is not retired.

1486
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,824
He's still very much
in the C.I.A.

1487
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:44,912
Daddy. What...
He's right.

1488
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:48,499
He's right. My cover's blown.

1489
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:53,378
I am planning a secret
operation the day
after the wedding.

1490
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,047
What?

1491
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:57,800
A surprise honeymoon
for Deb and Bob.

1492
01:24:57,884 --> 01:25:00,969
You stupid son of a bitch!
You just blew it!

1493
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:02,596
What?

1494
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:05,265
Ko Samui is an island
off the coast of Thailand!

1495
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:09,019
That guy I was meeting in
the parking lot is
Thor Svenson, my travel agent.

1496
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:11,146
He was giving me their visas.

1497
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:17,111
Wow, Thailand.
Thanks a lot, J. B.
That's something.

1498
01:25:17,403 --> 01:25:19,446
Don't mention it. I just...

1499
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,366
You know, if this nursing
thing doesn't work out,
Focker,

1500
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,536
I'd say you definitely
have a career in espionage.

1501
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:29,790
Thanks, Greg.

1502
01:26:04,033 --> 01:26:07,077
Well, I guess I'm gonna go
to the airport now.

1503
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,876
I guess you're
gonna stay here.

1504
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:19,590
Pam, I...

1505
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:53,373
Gaylord M. Focker?

1506
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,083
Gaylord? Gaylord?

1507
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:56,793
Yeah, that's me.

1508
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,339
I thought your name was Greg.
lt is.

1509
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,591
That's not what it says
on the form.
I know.

1510
01:27:02,675 --> 01:27:06,303
It's my legal name.
Nobody's called me by it
since I was in third grade.

1511
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:07,804
(DEN NY LAUG HING)

1512
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:09,723
DELlVERY MAN: Whatever.

1513
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:14,937
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
So your name's Gay Focker?

1514
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:18,148
(ALL LAUG HING)

1515
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:21,693
Denny.

1516
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:23,612
I'm sorry. It's just it's not
a normal name.

1517
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,365
Come on.

1518
01:27:26,866 --> 01:27:29,201
Now look what you've done.
Oh, Pammy.

1519
01:27:29,285 --> 01:27:30,702
Don't go away.

1520
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:07,614
You're in luck. There is room.

1521
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:20,419
And without a Saturday
stay-over, that fare
difference will be $1, 137. 11.

1522
01:28:23,923 --> 01:28:25,632
Did you want me to
book you the seat?

1523
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:27,050
Okay. All right.

1524
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:30,679
Did you want to
check any bags today?

1525
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:16,350
We should be all right
with only one usher,
don't you think?

1526
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:19,061
I'm not so sure, Jack.

1527
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:28,487
Thought you might
like to see this.

1528
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:37,537
How did you get this?

1529
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:39,456
Oh, I have my sources too.

1530
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:47,631
I called Gaylord,
a. k.a. Greg's parents
in Detroit.

1531
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:51,426
They saved his SAT scores too,
in case you're interested.

1532
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:55,514
Oh, honey. That doesn't matter
if he did well on some test.

1533
01:29:55,598 --> 01:29:57,557
What does that prove?
Look at this place!

1534
01:29:57,642 --> 01:30:00,435
He almost destroyed
the wedding
because he lied!

1535
01:30:02,105 --> 01:30:03,772
I love you, Daddy,

1536
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,692
but you can be
a real jerk sometimes.

1537
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:15,325
So what if he took the MCATs?
He's still not good enough
for Pam.

1538
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,244
Who is, Jack?

1539
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:20,664
Nobody has ever been
good enough for your Pam.

1540
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:28,588
I mean, do you realize
that you never even
warmed up to Kevin

1541
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,674
until she broke up with him?

1542
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:34,678
Maybe it's time you think
about what Pam wants.

1543
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:51,111
Greg, it's me.

1544
01:30:52,196 --> 01:30:54,030
I'm sure you're
in the air by now,

1545
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:57,325
so I guess you'll just
get this when you get home.

1546
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:02,456
Listen, I am so sorry.

1547
01:31:03,499 --> 01:31:05,667
I acted like a complete idiot,

1548
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:08,837
and I hope that
you can forgive me.

1549
01:31:09,755 --> 01:31:13,884
I mean, I don't care about
the fire or the cat or...

1550
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:19,723
I mean,
I can't believe you
actually spray-painted a cat.

1551
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:24,561
That's actually really gross,
but the point is that...

1552
01:31:26,272 --> 01:31:29,191
That I understand
why you did it,

1553
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:30,734
and I love you.

1554
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:35,113
I want you to know
that I really love you, and...

1555
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:41,203
When you get this,
will you please call me?

1556
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:43,580

No, I'm not... Hey.

I'm not checking my bag, okay?

There's no need
to raise your voice, sir.

1587
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:01,301
I'm not raising my voice.
This would be
raising my voice to you, okay?

1588
01:34:01,385 --> 01:34:03,136
I don't want to check my bag.

1589
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:06,222
By the way, your airline,
you suck at checking bags.

1590
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:08,224
Because I already
did that once,
and you lost it,

1591
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:11,227
and then I had everything
screwed up very badly
for me. Okay?

1592
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,480
I can assure you that your bag
will be placed safely

1593

1594
01:34:15,232 --> 01:34:18,777
Oh, yeah? How do you know
my bag will be safe below
with the other luggage?

1595
01:34:18,861 --> 01:34:21,196
Are you physically gonna
take my bag beneath the plane?

1596
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:24,491
Are you gonna go with the guys
with the earmuffs
and put it in there?

1597
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:27,327
No.
No? Okay.
Then shut your pie hole

1598
01:34:27,411 --> 01:34:30,497

01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:33,500
with the checking-of-the-bags
conversation!

on this airline that if
a bag is this large, we...

Get your grubby little paws
off of my bag, okay?

1602
01:34:40,591 --> 01:34:43,843

in here. It's not like
I want to blow up the plane.

1603
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:47,222
I wanna stow my bag
according to your
safety regulations.

1604
01:34:47,306 --> 01:34:49,474

If you would take a second

1605
01:34:49,558 --> 01:34:51,726
and take the little sticks
out of your head
and clean out your ears,

1606
01:34:51,811 --> 01:34:53,812
maybe you would see
that I'm a person
who has feelings,

1607
01:34:53,896 --> 01:34:56,064
and all I have to do
is do what I wanna do!

1608
01:34:56,148 --> 01:34:59,859
All I wanna do is hold onto
my bag and not listen to you!

1609
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:03,530
The only way that I would
ever let go of my bag would be
if you came over here now

1610
01:35:03,614 --> 01:35:05,865
and tried to pry it
from my dead,
lifeless fingers.

1611
01:35:06,283 --> 01:35:10,286
Okay? If you can get it
from my kung fu grip,
then you can have it.

1612
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:12,706
Okay? Otherwise,
step off, bitch.

1618

Tow it.

1619
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:33,727
I've got a plane full
of people saying you
threatened that stewardess.

1620
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:35,270
I was not threatening her.

1621
01:35:35,354 --> 01:35:37,731
I was trying to get my bag
into the overhead
storage thing.

1622
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:40,442
You were acting like a maniac,
and you threatened her
with a bomb!

1623
01:35:40,526 --> 01:35:42,652
I said I didn't have a bomb!
You said "bomb."

1624
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,070
I said, "It's not like
I have a bomb."

1625
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:45,613
You said "bomb"
on an airplane.

1626
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:47,365
What's wrong with saying
"bomb" on an airplane?

1627
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,033
You can't say "bomb"
on an airplane.

1628
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:53,204
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb,
bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb,
bomb! You gonna arrest me?

1629
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,706
You assaulted
an airline employee...

1630
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:56,249
What if I was a bombardier?

1631
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:58,084
I got enough to put you away
for a few years!

1632
01:35:58,169 --> 01:35:59,169

01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:14,392
Oh, shit. How'd you get here?

1636
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:16,394
I'm everywhere, Focker.

1637
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:18,521
I didn't do anything, Jack.

1638
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:20,064
Yeah, I know.

1639
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:22,609
Well, then tell these guys
that I'm not a terrorist.

1640
01:36:22,693 --> 01:36:26,488
Listen, Focker. I'm not gonna
tell anybody anything until
you answer some questions.

1641
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:29,407
Unless you want to spend
the next couple of years
of your life in prison,

1642
01:36:29,492 --> 01:36:30,992
you better goddamn
well tell me the truth.

1643
01:36:31,076 --> 01:36:33,703
No more lies. You understand?
No more lies.

1644
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:36,456
Did you do this?
Just answer the questions.

1645
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:37,707
Did you have me
taken off of that airplane?

1646
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:38,958
Just answer the question.

1647
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,002
Put your hands
over there. That's it.

1648
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:43,421

1649
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:49,636

1650
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:50,804
Yes.

1651
01:36:50,888 --> 01:36:53,723
Are you a male nurse?
Yes.

1652
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:55,642
Are you a pothead?
No.

1653
01:36:55,726 --> 01:36:58,061
Have you ever smoked pot?
Yes.

1654
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:02,565
Did you spray-paint
the tail of a cat to
pass him off as Mr. Jinx?

1655
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:03,942
Yes.

1656
01:37:04,026 --> 01:37:06,736
Did you do that because
you desperately were
seeking my approval?

1657
01:37:06,821 --> 01:37:07,821
Yes.

1658
01:37:07,905 --> 01:37:09,405
Because you
love my daughter Pam?

1659
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:10,532
Yes.

1660
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:12,450
Do you wanna marry her?

1661
01:37:14,286 --> 01:37:16,287
Do you want to marry her?

1662
01:37:18,624 --> 01:37:21,584
I did, until I met you.

1663
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:24,921
What does that mean?

1664
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:28,758
I love your daughter, Jack.
I love her more than anything.

1665
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:33,096
But frankly, sir,
I'm a little terrified
of being your son-in-law.

1666
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,682
This whole weekend
has given me a lot of doubts

1667
01:37:35,766 --> 01:37:38,476
about whether or not
I could even survive
in your family.

1668
01:37:42,565 --> 01:37:45,275
I think you've got
some serious issues.

1669
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:50,321
If I lighten up,
would you consider
marrying my daughter?

1670
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:52,574
Would you lighten up a lot?

1671
01:37:53,993 --> 01:37:55,743
Yeah.
Yes or no?

1672
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:57,036
Yes.

1673
01:37:57,121 --> 01:38:00,164
Would you let me and Pam
live our lives and
not interfere all the time?

1674
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:03,042
I promise not to interfere
in your lives all the time.

1675
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:05,628
Will you stop making fun of me
for being a nurse?

1676
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:09,048
Could you at least try,
maybe, to consider
another profession?

1677
01:38:09,133 --> 01:38:10,300
Jack, yes or no?

1678
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:11,885
Ever?
No!

1679
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:13,469
Okay, yes.

1680
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:16,306
Would you let me and Pam sleep
in the same room?

1681
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:19,475
Don't push it, Focker.
You're in a real mess.

1682
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:24,397
If you married my daughter,
would you support her

1683
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:26,691
in the way
that she deserves
to be supported?

1684
01:38:26,775 --> 01:38:28,026
Yes.

1685
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:30,653
Would you be honest
and faithful to her?

1686
01:38:31,113 --> 01:38:32,488
Yes.

1687
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:36,534
Will you devote yourself
entirely to her
for the rest of your life?

1688
01:38:37,077 --> 01:38:38,453
Of course.

1689
01:38:39,955 --> 01:38:41,456
Gaylord Focker,

1690
01:38:43,959 --> 01:38:45,877
will you be my son-in-law?

1691

(DOOR OPENING)

1692
01:39:07,858 --> 01:39:09,192
Greg?

1693
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:11,903
I thought you were
going back to Chicago?

1694
01:39:11,987 --> 01:39:14,864
Yeah, well, we had
a little plane trouble.

1695
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:17,325
Plus, your dad caught up
with me at the airport.

1696
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:19,369
No. Don't worry.

1697
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:21,955
It's okay. We worked out
a lot of our issues.

1698
01:39:22,706 --> 01:39:25,625
You and my dad worked out
a lot of your issues?

1699
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:29,545
Yeah. First he gave me his
little human lie detector
thing, but I passed.

1700
01:39:30,422 --> 01:39:31,589
Good.

1701
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:34,133
Yeah, and...

1702
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:37,053
Then he proposed.

1703
01:39:40,516 --> 01:39:42,558
Are you feeling all right?

1704
01:39:44,395 --> 01:39:47,897
Listen. This weekend
was a nightmare.

1705
01:39:49,024 --> 01:39:50,817
I had this whole
elaborate plan,

1706
01:39:50,901 --> 01:39:54,862
and then somewhere between
giving your sister a black eye

1707
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:58,574
and setting the house on fire,
it kind of went off track.

1708
01:40:00,911 --> 01:40:03,746
I just... I love you.
I love you so much.

1709
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:10,003
I think he's
about to do it, Jack.

1710
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:12,755
Come on, honey.
Give them some privacy.

1711
01:40:14,758 --> 01:40:16,718
...and I think if
we can get through

1712
01:40:17,928 --> 01:40:21,514
what we got through in
the last 48 hours, we could
get through anything.

1713
01:40:22,766 --> 01:40:24,392
I think so too.

1714
01:40:24,476 --> 01:40:27,270
And, Greg, I don't...
Wait. Hang on a second.

1715
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:30,106
Mr. Jinx? Mew, mew, mew, mew.

1716
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:32,358
Mew, mew, mew, mew.

1717
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:40,533
That's a ring.

1718
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:45,246
I like to think of it
as a little circle of trust.

1719
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:49,000
Pam?

1720
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:52,962
Will you marry me?
Yes.

1721
01:40:54,298 --> 01:41:01,179
Yes.

1722
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:05,016
Attaboy, Greg!

1723
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:08,978
That "circle of trust" thing?
That's mine.

1724
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:15,193
Well, looks like we got
another wedding to plan.

1725
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:18,237
Yep. Just gotta do
one more thing.
What's that?

1726
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:19,781
Meet his parents.

1727
01:41:21,116 --> 01:41:23,034
Jack...
Honey, relax.

1728
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:25,995
I'm sure they're wonderful,
fascinating people.

1729
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:28,498
Good night, Jack.

1730
01:41:36,173 --> 01:41:39,801

right, to name their son
Gaylord Focker?

What do you think?

01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:58,087
<i>Hello, Jack.</i>

1741
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:01,716
<i>Oh, look at that.</i>
<i>Nice Jack. Hi.</i>

1742

<i>Jack? What?</i>

<i>Yeah, you thought Puff was</i>
<i>just the name of</i>
<i>the boy's magical dragon?</i>
