1
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,018
<i>Did you know there are more people
with genius IQs living in China</i>

2
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,145
<i>than there are people of any kind
living in the United States?</i>

3
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:23,022
<i>- That can't possibly be true.
- It is.</i>

4
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,148
<i>What would account for that?</i>

5
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:27,234
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question.

6
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,445
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

7
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,363
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

8
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,240
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.

9
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,451
I wasn't talking about China anymore,
I was talking about me.

10
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,994
You got a 1600?

11
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,912
Yes. I could sing in an a cappella group,
but I can't sing.

12
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,205
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,583
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

14
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,917
Or you could get into a final club.

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,335
Or I get into a final club.

16
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,837
You know, from a woman's perspective,

17
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,797
sometimes not singing in
an a cappella group is a good thing.

18
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,923
This is serious.

19
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,467
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.

20
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,427
Well, I can't do that.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,095
I was kidding.

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,346
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

23
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,223
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

24
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,142
<i>- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.</i>

25
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,478
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?

26
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,521
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.

27
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,148
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

28
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,150
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

29
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,276
No.

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,445
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

31
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,988
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew

32
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,114
so I assumed you had met one.

33
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:18,202
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

34
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,787
Okay.

35
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,330
Should we get something to eat?

36
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,207
Would you like to talk
about something else?

37
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,710
No. It's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club,

38
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,670
I think I may have missed a birthday.

39
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,633
There are really more people in China with
genius IQs than the entire population...

40
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:36,053
The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.

41
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,221
Which one?

42
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,806
The Porcellian, the Porc.
It's the best of the best.

43
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,641
- Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.

44
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,061
Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls

45
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,604
who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?

46
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,398
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.

47
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,025
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?

48
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,405
- Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.

49
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,658
None of them. That's the point.

50
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,661
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer

51
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,079
and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.

52
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,123
The ability to make money doesn't
impress anybody around here.

53
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,459
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?

54
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,878
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.

55
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,172
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

56
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,340
I think you asked me that

57
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,217
because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into

58
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,552
is the one where I'll have the best chance.

59
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,971
I... What?

60
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,597
You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into

61
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,183
because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance.

62
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,769
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one

63
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,020
where anybody has the best chance.

64
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,689
You didn't ask me which one
was the best one,

65
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,232
you asked me which one
was the easiest one.

66
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,902
I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.

67
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,363
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Erica.

68
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,782
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

69
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,243
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about it

70
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,995
who will prescribe you
some sort of medication.

71
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,581
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.

72
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,375
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs."

73
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,171
And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.

74
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,090
Yes. There is.

75
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,842
Well, you do.
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

76
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,177
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

77
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,012
I'm just saying I need to do
something substantial

78
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,930
in order to get the attention of the clubs.

79
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,765
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.

80
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,268
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

81
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,936
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president

82
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,938
because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

83
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,274
He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,736
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?

85
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,362
Did you really just say that?

86
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,947
I was kidding.

87
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,699
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

88
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,867
I wanna try to be straightforward with you

89
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,203
and tell you I think you might
want to be a little more supportive.

90
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,873
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings,

91
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,126
and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.

92
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,712
You would do that for me?

93
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,756
We're dating.

94
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,216
Okay.

95
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,469
Well, I wanna try and be
straightforward with you

96
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,387
and let you know that we're not anymore.

97
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,973
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.

98
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,142
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.

99
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,227
You're breaking up with me?

100
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,561
You're gonna introduce me to people

101
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,313
I wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet?

102
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,232
What the... What is that supposed to mean?

103
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,566
- Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?

104
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,485
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now

105
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,320
is 'cause you used to sleep
with the door guy.

106
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,075
"The door guy"? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.

107
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,579
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.

108
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,165
And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?

109
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,501
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.

110
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,919
- Is this real?
- Yes.

111
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,004
- Then wait, I apologize, okay?
- I have to go study.

112
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,422
- Erica?
- Yes?

113
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,758
- I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.

114
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,094
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.

115
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,428
- I can't.
- Why?

116
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,431
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.

117
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,684
All I meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently...

118
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,935
I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.

119
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,187
I was saying that you go to BU.
I was stating a fact, that's all,

120
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,355
and if it seemed rude, then I apologize.

121
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,773
- I have to go study.
- You don't have to study.

122
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,191
Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study?

123
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,110
'Cause you go to BU.

124
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,655
Do you want to get some food?

125
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,200
I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.

126
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,202
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat,
so we're even.

127
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,038
- I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.

128
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,206
I was just being polite.

129
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,457
I have no intention
of being friends with you.

130
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,626
I'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class

131
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,296
and if we could just order some food,
I think we should...

132
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:02,050
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

133
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,137
But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you

134
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,888
because you're a nerd.

135
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,559
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.

136
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,688
It'll be because you're an asshole.

137
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,788
<i>Erica Albright's a bitch.</i>

138
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,416
<i>Do you think that's because her family
changed their name from Albrecht,</i>

139
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,753
<i>or do you think it's because
all BU girls are bitches?</i>

140
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,134
<i>For the record, she may look like a 34C,</i>

141
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,887
<i>but she's getting all kinds of help
from our friends at Victoria's Secret.</i>

142
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:38,058
<i>She's a 34B, as in barely anDhing there.
False advertising.</i>

143
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,897
<i>The truth is, she has a nice face.</i>

144
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,274
<i>I need to do something
to take my mind off her.</i>

145
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,944
<i>Easy enough, except I need an idea.</i>

146
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,244
<i>I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie.</i>

147
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,246
<i>So what if it's not even 10:00 p.m.
And it's a Tuesday night?</i>

148
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,372
Billy.

149
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,207
<i>The Kirkland facebook
is open on my desktop,</i>

150
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,960
<i>and some of these people have
pretty horrendous facebook pics.</i>

151
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,630
<i>Billy Olson's sitting here and had
the idea of putting some of the pictures</i>

152
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,967
<i>next to pictures of farm animals
and have people vote on who's hotter.</i>

153
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,635
<i>Good call, Mr. Olson.</i>

154
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,019
<i>Yeah, it's on.
I'm not gonna do the farm animals,</i>

155
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,938
<i>but I like the idea of comparing
two people together.</i>

156
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,523
<i>It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel</i>

157
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,567
<i>since people's ratings of the pictures
will be more implicit</i>

158
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,194
<i>than, say, choosing a number to
represent each person's hotness,</i>

159
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,988
<i>like they do on hotornot. Com.</i>

160
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,615
<i>The first thing we're going to need
is a lot of pictures.</i>

161
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,909
<i>Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep
a public centralized facebook,</i>

162
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,035
<i>so I'm going to have to get all the images</i>

163
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,787
<i>from the individual houses
that people are in.</i>

164
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,623
<i>Let the hacking begin.</i>

165
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,682
<i>First up is Kirkland.</i>

166
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,768
<i>They keep everything open and allow
indexes in their Apache configuration.</i>

167
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:08,398
<i>So a little Wget magic is all that's necessary
to download the entire Kirkland facebook.</i>

168
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,524
<i>Kids' stuff.</i>

169
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,043
<i>Next is Eliot.</i>

170
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,253
<i>They're also open,
but with no indexes on Apache.</i>

171
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,379
<i>I can run an empty search</i>

172
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,840
<i>and it returns all of the images
in the database in a single page.</i>

173
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:37,218
<i>And I can save the page and Mozilla
will save all the images for me.</i>

174
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,928
<i>Excellent. Moving right along.</i>

175
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,473
Excuse me! Everybody!

176
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,976
You are at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs,

177
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,854
not just at Harvard, but in the world.

178
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,230
And I want to welcome you all

179
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,734
to Phoenix Club's first party
of the fall semester!

180
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,535
<i>Lowell has some security.
They require a user name/password combo,</i>

181
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,789
<i>and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't
have access to the main FAS user database,</i>

182
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,082
<i>so they have no way
of detecting an intrusion.</i>

183
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,003
<i>Adams has no security, but limits
the number of results to 20 a page.</i>

184
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,173
<i>All I need to do is break out the same script
I used on Lowell and we're set.</i>

185
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,760
<i>Quincy has no online facebook.
What a sham.</i>

186
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,136
<i>Nothing I can do about that.</i>

187
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,639
<i>Dunster is intense.</i>

188
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,433
<i>Not only is there no public directory,
but there's no directory at all.</i>

189
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,559
<i>You have to do searches,</i>

190
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,229
<i>and if your search returns more
than 20 matches, nothing gets returned.</i>

191
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,564
<i>And once you do get results,
they don't link directly to the images.</i>

192
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,234
<i>They link to a PHP that redirects
or something. Weird.</i>

193
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,777
<i>This may be difficult. I'll come back later.</i>

194
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,654
- Hey, Shark Week's on.
- What?

195
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,407
- Great white, beautiful fish.
- Nice.

196
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,158
<i>Leverett is a little better.
They still make you search,</i>

197
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,370
<i>but you can do an empty search and get
links to pages with every student's picture.</i>

198
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,123
<i>It's slightly obnoxious that they
only let you view one picture at a time,</i>

199
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,084
<i>and there's no way I'm going to go
to 500 pages to download pics one at a time.</i>

200
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,546
<i>So it's definitely necessary to break out
Emacs and modify that Perl script.</i>

201
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,683
Here you go.

202
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,981
<i>Done.</i>

203
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,150
Hey, what's going on?

204
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,903
<i>Perfect timing. Eduardo's here
and he's going to have the key ingredient.</i>

205
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,613
- Hey, Mark.
- Wardo.

206
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,699
You and Erica split up.

207
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,867
How did you know that?

208
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,493
It's on your blog.

209
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,121
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

210
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,540
- I need you.
- I'm here for you.

211
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,667
No, I need the algorithm you use
to rank chess players.

212
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,003
- Are you okay?
- We're ranking girls.

213
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,382
- You mean other students.
- Yeah.

214
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,176
You think this is such a good idea?

215
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,761
- I need the algorithm.
- Mark...

216
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,679
I need the algorithm.

217
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,349
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.

218
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,896
At any given time Girl A has a rating R-a
and Girl B has a rating R-b.

219
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,732
When any two girls are matched up,
there's an expectation of which will win

220
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,941
based on their current rating, right?

221
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,528
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.

222
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,030
Let's write it.

223
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,630
One on the left.

224
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,423
The right.

225
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,925
Yeah, still the right.

226
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,843
- It works.
- Who should we send it to first?

227
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,969
- Dwyer.
- Neal.

228
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,139
- Who are you gonna send it to?
- Just a couple of people.

229
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,390
The question is,

230
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,060
who are they gonna send it to?

231
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,465
Hey, guys, check this out.

232
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,636
Someone go to the left. Dude, do left.

233
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,264
Look at these girls. Right or left?

234
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,599
- Left is hot.
- Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

235
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,394
Right or left?

236
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,271
That's my roommate.

237
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,273
- Oh, my God.
- The girl on the left.

238
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,359
This is pathetic.

239
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,485
Right.

240
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,778
Left.

241
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,446
- Left.
- Left?

242
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,866
Oh, shit.

243
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,034
Albright.

244
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,495
He blogged about you.

245
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,873
You don't wanna read it.

246
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,003
Left.

247
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,588
Latina.

248
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,881
Erica.

249
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,216
Is this yours?

250
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,759
I stole it from a tranny.

251
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,887
Get the hell out of here!

252
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,556
- Left.
- One on the right.

253
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,141
Left.

254
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,317
Man, that's an awful lot of traffic.

255
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,738
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down
before we get into trouble?

256
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,789
Hello?

257
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,919
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

258
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,879
At 4:00 in the morning?

259
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,090
Well, there's a very unusual amount
of traffic to the switch at Kirkland.

260
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,635
You're saying it's unusual
for 4:00 in the morning?

261
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,804
No, this'd be unusual
for halftime at the Super Bowl.

262
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,848
All right.

263
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,144
I gotta go in.

264
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,271
What's going on?

265
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,982
Harvard's network is about to crash.

266
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,281
You don't think...

267
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,576
I do.

268
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,496
Go see if it's everybody's.

269
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,419
I can't connect.

270
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,381
The network's down.

271
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,133
Unless it's a coincidence, I think this is us.

272
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,677
It's not a coincidence.

273
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,637
Holy shit.

274
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,476
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.

275
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,228
That's not what happened.

276
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,938
You weren't called in front
of the Administrative Board?

277
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,775
No, back. I mean back at the bar
with Erica Albright. She said all that?

278
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,485
- Mark...
- That I said that stuff to her?

279
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,237
I was reading from the transcript
of her deposition.

280
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,989
Yeah, why would you even need
to depose her?

281
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,740
That's really for us to decide.

282
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,369
You think if I know she can make me
look like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle.

283
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,870
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute?

284
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,706
Can we do that?
It's been almost three hours.

285
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,459
And frankly, you did spend an awful lot
of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg

286
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,378
with the girl's testimony from the bar.

287
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,088
I'm not embarrassed,
she just made a lot of that up.

288
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,256
She was under oath.

289
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,717
Then I guess that would be the first time
somebody's lied under oath.

290
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,522
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours?

291
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,982
Thousand.

292
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,233
What?

293
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,194
Twenty-two thousand.

294
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,614
Wow.

295
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,884
These guys are just freakin' fast.

296
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,017
Is there any way to make this a fair fight?

297
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,852
Jump out and swim.

298
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,480
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.

299
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,608
Well, you could row forward
and I could row backward.

300
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,944
We're genetically identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.

301
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,112
Just row the damn boat.

302
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,955
- You guys hear about this?
- What?

303
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,667
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked
the network from a laptop at Kirkland.

304
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,252
- Really?
- At 4:00 a.m.

305
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,837
How?

306
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,965
He set up a website where you vote
on the hotness of female undergrads.

307
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,884
What were we doing
that none of us heard about this?

308
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,010
I don't know.

309
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,638
A three-hour low-rate
technical row before breakfast.

310
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,181
Full course load. Studying.

311
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,558
Another three hours in the tank
and then studying.

312
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,851
I'm not sure how we missed it.

313
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,561
How much activity was there on this thing?

314
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,438
Twenty-two thousand page requests.

315
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,357
Twenty-two thousand?

316
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,901
Cam, this guy hacked
the facebook of seven houses.

317
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,654
He set up the whole website in one night,
and he did it while he was drunk.

318
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,905
Twenty-two thousand?

319
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,408
- Well, how do you know he was drunk?
- He was blogging simultaneously.

320
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,162
- You know what I think?
- Way ahead of you.

321
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,914
This is our guy.

322
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,916
Cameron Winklevoss.

323
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,211
W-l-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.

324
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,587
"Cameron" spelled the usual way.

325
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,256
Tyler Winklevoss.

326
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,676
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my
last name is the same as my brother's.

327
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,471
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is
an Administrative Board hearing.

328
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,766
You're being accused
of intentionally breaching security,

329
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,268
violating copyrights,

330
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:10,648
violating individual privacy
by creating the website www.facemash.com.

331
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,526
You're also charged with
being in violation of university policy,

332
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,820
on distribution of digitized images.

333
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,948
Before we begin with our questioning,
you're allowed to make a statement.

334
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,241
Would you like to do so?

335
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,285
I...

336
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,999
You know, I've already apologized
in The Crimson to the ABHW,

337
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,667
to Fuerza Latina,

338
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,086
and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted,

339
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,422
as I take it that they were.

340
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,383
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security,

341
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,344
I believe I deserve
some recognition from this board.

342
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,473
- I'm sorry?
- Yes.

343
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,559
I don't understand.

344
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,685
Which part?

345
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,854
You deserve recognition?

346
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,065
I believe I've pointed out
some pretty gaping holes in your system.

347
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,151
- Excuse me, may I?
- Yes.

348
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,653
Mr. Zuckerberg,

349
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,948
I'm in charge of security
for all computers on the Harvard network,

350
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,451
and I can assure you of its sophistication.

351
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:07,121
In fact, it was that level of sophistication
that led us to you in less than four hours.

352
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,831
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

353
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,957
That would be impressive,

354
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,375
except if you had known
what you were looking for,

355
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,252
you would have seen it
written on my dorm room window.

356
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,009
So?

357
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,428
Six months academic probation.

358
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,764
Wow. Well, they had to make
an example out of you.

359
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,432
They had my blog.

360
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,309
I shouldn't have written
that thing about the farm animals.

361
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,685
That was stupid.

362
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,855
But I was kidding, for God's sakes.
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?

363
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,358
- I tried to stop you.
- I know.

364
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,986
How do you do this thing where
you manage to get all girls to hate us?

365
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,988
- And why do I let you?
- I know.

366
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,574
- You can't do that.
- Wardo, I said I know.

367
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,743
Okay, let's look at a sample problem.

368
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:49,205
Suppose we're given a computer
with a 16-bit virtual address

369
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,582
and a page size of 256 bytes.

370
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,879
The system uses one-level page tables
that start at address hex 400.

371
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,591
Maybe you want DMA on your 16-bit system.
Who knows?

372
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,345
The first few pages are reserved
for hardware flags, etc.

373
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,306
Assume page-table entries have
eight status bits.

374
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,226
The eight status bits would then be...

375
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,602
Anybody?

376
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,314
And I see we have our first surrender.

377
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,691
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg.

378
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,985
Brighter men than you
have tried and failed this class.

379
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:23,864
One valid bit, one modified bit,
one reference bit and five permission bits.

380
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,201
That is correct.

381
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,162
Does everybody see how he got there?

382
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,003
Mark?

383
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,047
- You Mark Zuckerberg?
- Yeah.

384
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,341
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi.

385
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,467
Tyler Winklevoss.

386
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,927
Are you guys related?

387
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,512
- That's good.
- Funny.

388
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,055
We never heard that before.

389
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,433
So, what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?

390
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,601
No. You didn't. Actually, I don't know.

391
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,395
- Yeah, we never asked.
- We should do that.

392
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,521
No.

393
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,565
We have an idea
we want to talk to you about.

394
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,942
You got a minute?

395
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,070
You guys look like
you spend some time at the gym.

396
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,697
- We have to.
- Why?

397
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,198
We row crew.

398
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,118
- Yeah, I've got a minute.
- Great.

399
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,125
- So, you ever been inside the Porcellian?
- No.

400
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,835
You understand we can't take you
past the bike room,

401
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,003
because you're not a member.

402
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,504
I've heard.

403
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,260
- You want a sandwich or something?
- Okay.

404
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,012
- Mark, right?
- Yeah.

405
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,097
- Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

406
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,016
We were really impressed with Facemash.

407
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,685
When we checked you out,
you also built CourseMatch.

408
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,811
I don't know CourseMatch.

409
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,314
You go online and see
what courses your friends are taking.

410
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,024
It's really smart, man.

411
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,277
- Mark.
- Yeah.

412
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,154
We were talking about CourseMatch.

413
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,199
It was kind of a no-brainer.

414
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,242
But you invented something
in high school, too, right?

415
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,746
An app for an MP3 player
that recognizes your taste in music.

416
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,790
Anybody try to buy it?

417
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,458
Microsoft.

418
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,627
Wow. How much?

419
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,796
Didn't sell it. Uploaded it for free.

420
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,547
- For free?
- Yeah.

421
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,840
Why?

422
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,261
Okay, well, we have something
that we've been working on for a while

423
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,429
and we think it's great.

424
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,764
It's called the Harvard Connection.

425
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:15,267
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.

426
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,645
And then people can go online,
see your bio, request to be your...

427
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,147
Yeah, how is that different
from MySpace or Friendster?

428
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,152
Harvard. Edu.

429
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,655
Harvard. Edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country, man.

430
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,074
I mean, the whole site's kind of
based on the idea that girls...

431
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,076
Not to put anything indelicately, but...

432
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,911
Girls wanna go with guys
who go to Harvard.

433
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,288
Divya and my brother don't have trouble
putting things indelicately.

434
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,875
The main difference between what we're
talking about and MySpace or Friendster,

435
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,377
or any of those other
social networking sites is...

436
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,213
Is exclusivity. Right?

437
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,090
- Right.
- Yeah.

438
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,633
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark.

439
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,427
I mean, we need a gifted programmer
who's creative.

440
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,137
And we know that
you've been taking it in the shins.

441
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:54,140
Women's groups are ready
to declare a fatwa.

442
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,684
But, you know, this could help
rehabilitate your image.

443
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,687
Wow. You would do that for me?

444
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,357
We'd like to work with you.

445
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,527
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.

446
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,196
Our second programmer
just got overwhelmed with schoolwork.

447
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,491
We would need you to build the site and
write the code, and we'll provide all the...

448
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,868
I'm in.

449
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,537
What?

450
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,539
I'm in.

451
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:19,957
Awesome.

452
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,709
That's what you said?

453
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,087
It was three or four years ago.
I don't know what I said.

454
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,505
When did you come to Eduardo?

455
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,591
I don't understand that question.

456
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,342
Do you remember answering
in the affirmative?

457
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,178
The affirmative?

458
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,221
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for Facebook?

459
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,931
It was called The Facebook then.

460
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,559
This doesn't need to be that difficult.

461
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,145
I'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.

462
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,605
Did you answer affirmatively

463
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,149
when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Divya Narendra

464
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,817
asked you to build Harvard Connection?

465
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,569
Did you say yes?

466
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,447
I said I'd help.

467
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,533
When did you approach Mr. Saverin
with the idea for The Facebook?

468
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,118
I wouldn't say I approached him.

469
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,370
- Sy.
- You can answer the question.

470
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,873
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.

471
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,333
What's that?

472
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,376
The Jewish fraternity.

473
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,213
It was Caribbean Night.

474
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,149
It's not that guys like me
are generally attracted to Asian girls.

475
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,152
It's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.

476
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,279
I'm developing an algorithm
to define the connection

477
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,281
between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

478
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,368
I don't think it's that complicated.
They're hot, they're smart,

479
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,412
they're not Jewish, and they can't dance.

480
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,956
Hey, Mark's here.

481
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,249
Mark!

482
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,962
Be right back.

483
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,554
I think I've come up with something.

484
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,847
Hang on. I gotta tell you something
that you're not gonna believe.

485
00:25:58,974 --> 00:25:59,974
What?

486
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,351
I got punched by the Phoenix.

487
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,645
- Are you kidding?
- No.

488
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,064
I mean, it's just the first
of a four-step process,

489
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,942
but they slid the invitation
under my door tonight.

490
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,902
I go to my first punch party tomorrow.

491
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,153
So...

492
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,656
You got punched by the Phoenix.

493
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,450
Yeah, but, you know,
it was probably just a diversity thing.

494
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,036
It was just a diversity thing.
Just ride that horse until...

495
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,830
What did you wanna talk to me about?

496
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,373
- Mark?
- Yeah.

497
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,499
You said you'd come up with something.

498
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,210
Yeah, I think I've come up with something.
Come outside and let's talk.

499
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,587
It's 20 degrees outside.

500
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,839
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls,

501
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,008
which has absolutely
nothing to do with the Caribbean.

502
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,146
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?

503
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,314
Yeah.

504
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,982
But it wasn't because
they saw pictures of hot girls.

505
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,276
You can go anywhere on the Internet
and see pictures of hot girls.

506
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,402
Yeah.

507
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,155
It was because they saw pictures
of girls that they knew.

508
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,574
People want to go on the Internet
and check out their friends,

509
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,117
so why not build a website that offers that?

510
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:03,329
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit.

511
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,205
Browse around.
Maybe it's someone you just met at a party.

512
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,416
But I'm not talking about a dating site.

513
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:12,921
I'm talking about taking the entire social
experience of college and putting it online.

514
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,591
- I can't feel my legs.
- I know.

515
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,217
I'm totally psyched about this, too.
But, Wardo?

516
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,385
Yeah?

517
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,554
"It would be exclusive."

518
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,641
You would have to know the people
on the site to get past your own page.

519
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,601
Like getting punched.

520
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,603
Now, that's good.

521
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,855
Wardo, it's like a final club,
except we're the president.

522
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,108
I told him I thought it sounded great.

523
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,235
It was a great idea.

524
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,362
There was nothing to hack.

525
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,490
People were gonna provide
their own pictures, their own information.

526
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:44,370
And people had the ability to invite,
or not invite, their friends to join.

527
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,499
See, in a world where
social structure was everything,

528
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,417
that was the thing.

529
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,294
It was a big project,

530
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,547
and he was going to have to write
tens of thousands of lines of code,

531
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,258
so I wondered why he was
coming to me and not his roommates,

532
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,011
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.
They were programmers.

533
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,473
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

534
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,684
So that was why.

535
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,394
- Did he offer terms?
- Yes.

536
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,437
We'll split it, 70/30.

537
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,065
70 for me, 30 for you
for putting up the $1,000

538
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,401
and for handling everything
on the business end. You're CFO.

539
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,527
<i>And you said?</i>

540
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,237
I said, "Let's do it."

541
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,197
Okay. Did he add anything else?

542
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,657
Yes.

543
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,955
It probably was a diversity thing.

544
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,332
But so what?

545
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,792
Why do you think he said that?

546
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,086
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
but whose discovery is this?

547
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,921
Sy, if you'll let me continue
with my line of questioning.

548
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,089
What are you suggesting?

549
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,341
That I was jealous of Eduardo
for getting punched by the Phoenix

550
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,009
and began a plan
to screw him out of a company

551
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,803
- I hadn't even invented yet.
- Were you?

552
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,138
- Gretchen.
- Jealous of Eduardo?

553
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,472
Stop typing. We're off the record.

554
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,598
Ma'am, I know you've done your homework,

555
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,267
and so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life.

556
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,352
But at the moment,
I could buy Mount Auburn Street,

557
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,647
take the Phoenix Club
and turn it into my ping-pong room.

558
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,862
I'll let you know how the party is.

559
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,996
<i>We recognize that you're a plaintiff
in one suit involving Facebook,</i>

560
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,497
and a witness in another.

561
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,665
Yes, sir.

562
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,752
At any time in the weeks
prior to Mark's telling you his idea,

563
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,337
did he mention Tyler Winklevoss,
Cameron Winklevoss,

564
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,715
Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection?

565
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,468
Yes. He said they'd asked him
to work on their site,

566
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:26,472
but that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

567
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,140
He said even his most pathetic friends

568
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:32,102
knew more about getting people
interested in a website than these guys.

569
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,104
"These guys," meaning my clients.

570
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:38,150
Yes. He resented...
Mark resented that your clients thought

571
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,652
that he needed to rehabilitate
his image after Facemash.

572
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,821
But Mark didn't want
to rehabilitate anything.

573
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,699
With Facemash, he'd hacked into
the Harvard computers,

574
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,410
he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board,
he'd gotten a lot of notoriety.

575
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,121
Facemash did exactly
what he wanted it to do.

576
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,665
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

577
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,542
he was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?

578
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,795
Not at the time, I wasn't. But...

579
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,508
It really didn't have much to do
with the Winklevosses' dating site.

580
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,634
How would you know?
You weren't even there.

581
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,802
Ty.

582
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,222
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

583
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,767
he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?

584
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,310
You're offering a conclusion
not found in evidence.

585
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,063
We are about to find it in evidence.

586
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,982
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss.</i>

587
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,984

589
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,490
<i>"And it seems like it shouldn't
take too long to implement.</i>

590
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:31,286
"So we can talk about it after I get all
the basic functionality up tomorrow night."

591
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:35,791
From Mark Zuckerberg
to Cameron Winklevoss. December 1 st, 2003.

592
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:39,378
<i>"Sorry I was unreachable tonight.
I just got about three of your missed calls.</i>

593
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,297
<i>"I was working on a problem set
for my systems class."</i>

<i>December 10, 2003.</i>

596
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,180
<i>"This week has been pretty busy
thus far with classes and work,</i>

597
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,392
<i>"so I think it's probably best
to postpone the meeting."</i>

598
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,602
"I'm also really busy tomorrow."

599
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,064
Okay, anybody else feel like
there's something up with this guy?

600
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,190
Tell him okay,

601
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,026
but we do have to make sure that
we meet up before we all go off for break.

602
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,363
I know, I know. Yeah, watch out.

603
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,520
Hey, Mark.

604
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,523
I need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MySQL back end.

605
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,108
It's gonna cost a little more money.

606
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,569
- How much more?
- About 200 more.

607
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,155
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.

608
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,368
- Do it.
- I already did.

609
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,832
Hey, guess what?

610
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,169
I made the second cut.

611
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,921
That's good.

612
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,674
You should be proud of that right there.
Don't worry if you don't make it any further.

613
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,972
I'll get out of here.

614
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,391
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss</i>

615
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,517
and Divya Narendra.

616
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,770
December 15th, 2003.

617
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,230
"I have a CS problem set
that I'm just getting started with

618
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,984
"and it should be about 15 hours of coding,
so I'll be busy tomorrow night."

619
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,404
"I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon."

620
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,615
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,868
"I've basically been in the lab
this whole time, and also I..."

622
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:39,581
"...won't be able to do Saturday,
as I have to meet up with my parents."

623
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:48,131
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.

624
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,550
It's also called the Statue of Three Lies.

625
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,470
What are the three lies?

626
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,430
Mr. Dowd.

627
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,641
The three lies. First...

628
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,850
Shit!

629
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,769
- Take your pants off.
- I know.

630
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,188
Mr. Saverin.

631
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,817
One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638.

632
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,236
Two, Harvard was not founded
by John Harvard.

633
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,862
And three, that is not John Harvard.

634
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,280
Who is it?

635
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:16,493
It's a friend of the sculptor, Daniel Chester.

636
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,537
Keep yourjacket on.

637
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,961
Thirty-nine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients,

638
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,423
and he still hadn't completed work
on Harvard Connection.

639
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,300
<i>But on January 11th, 2004,</i>

640
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:36,263
<i>Mr. Zuckerberg registered
the domain name The Facebook</i>

641
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,141
<i>via Network Solutions.</i>

642
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:44,271
To the best of your knowledge, had he even
begun work on Harvard Connection?

643
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,482
Not to my knowledge. No.

644
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,905
What in the world is this?

645
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:59,119
"Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little skeptical
that we have enough functionality in the site

646
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,788
"to really draw the attention
and gain the critical mass necessary

647
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,499
"to get a site like this to run"?

648
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,418
"We'll speak soon"?

649
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,339
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?

650
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,507
Yes, it was.

651
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:17,095
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return,

652
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,765
and this was the first time
he indicated he was not happy.

653
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,891
That's correct.

654
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,643
He had 42 days to study our system
and get out ahead.

655
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,812
- Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you...

656
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,439
Did I use any of your code?

657
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,357
You stole our whole goddamn idea.

658
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,651
- Fellas.
- What? Match.com for Harvard guys?

659
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,861
Can I continue with my deposition?

660
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:36,073
You know, you really don't need
a forensics team to get to the bottom of this.

661
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,783
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,

662
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,161
you'd have invented Facebook.

663
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,539
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder
and watch you write us a check.

664
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,916
No shit.

665
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,002
Let's continue.

666
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,131
February 4, 2004.

667
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,805
Mark.

668
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:03,767
There is a girl in your art history class.
Her name is Stephanie Attis.

669
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,727
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?

670
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,397
Have you ever seen her with anyone?

671
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,694
And, if not, do you happen to know
if she's looking to go out with anyone?

672
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,071
Dustin.

673
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:21,284
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says...

674
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,581
Mark?

675
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,443
We were supposed to meet at 9:00.

676
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,280
- Have you slept yet?
- I have to add something.

677
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,531
What?

678
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,669
Shit, that looks good.
That looks really good.

679
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,212
It's clean and simple.

680
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,007
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls."
But watch.

681
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,135
What'd you write?

682
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,180
"Relationship Status." "Interested In."

683
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,183
This is what drives life at college.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?"

684
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,561
It's why people take certain classes
and sit where they sit and do what they do.

685
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:33,523
And at its center, you know, that's
what The Facebook is gonna be about.

686
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,817
People are gonna log on because
after all the cake and watermelon,

687
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,943
there's a chance they're actually gonna...

688
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,237
- Gonna get laid.
...meet a girl. Yes.

689
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,864
That is really good.

690
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:41,990
And that was it.

691
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,742
- What do you mean?
- It's ready.

692
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,952
- It's ready? Right now?
- Yeah. That was it.

693
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,038
And here's the masthead.

694
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,581
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.

695
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:53,043
- "Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO."
- Yeah.

696
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,170
You have no idea what
that's gonna mean to my father.

697
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,588
Sure I do.

698
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,134
So when's it going live?

699
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,137
Right now. Get your laptop out.

700
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,890
What? Why do we need my laptop?

701
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:10,477
Because you got e-mails
for everybody at the Phoenix.

702
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:18,068
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool
with them that I spam their e-mails.

703
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,862
- This is not spam.
- No, I know it's not spam.

704
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,281
If we send it to our friends,
it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin.

705
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,699
I haven't gotten in yet.

706
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,827
These guys know people.
And I need their e-mails.

707
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,872
- Sure.
- Good.

708
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,166
Give me the mailing list.

709
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,585
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu.

710
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,836
These guys.

711
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,963
Yeah, they're literary geniuses

712
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,173
because the world's most obvious
Lewis Carroll reference is in...

713
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,800
- They're not so bad.
- I'm just saying.

714
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,677
Yeah, you're right.

715
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,102
The site's live.

716
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,230
You know, let's go get a drink and celebrate.

717
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,149
I'm buying.

718
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,735
Mark.

719
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,906
Mark, are you praying?

720
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,880
Whatever happened to Cole Porter
and Irving Berlin?

721
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,049
It's a Valentine's Day theme.
They're playing love songs.

722
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,175
Good point.

723
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,178
'Cause Cole Porter and Irving Berlin
never wrote any love songs.

724
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,351
Honey, you should put your laptop away.

725
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,395
Seven different people
spammed me the same link.

726
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,063
- KC.
- What is it?

727
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,189
I don't know.

728
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,025
But I'm really hoping
it's Cats That Look Like Hitler,

729
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,818
'cause I can never get enough of that.

730
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,488
No, it's not.

731
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,201
Div!

732
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,954
What?

733
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,711
This isn't mine.

734
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,546
Okay, what is wrong?

735
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,968
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

736
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,652
Hey!

737
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,904
Not now!

738
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,072
We need 20 minutes!

739
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,531
Okay.

740
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,869
I just wanted to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.

741
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,122
Mark Zuckerberg?

742
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,416
He stole our website.

743
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,877
It's been live for more than 36 hours.

744
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,593
Mr. Hotchkiss?
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad.

745
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,221
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother Tyler
and our business partner Divya.

746
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,347
"Welcome to The Facebook.

747
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,349
"The Facebook is an online directory
that connects people

748
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,892
"through different social networks.

749
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:59,145
"You must have a harvard. Edu address
to register."

750
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,689
Yeah, I called earlier.
I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.

751
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,108
Yes, sir.
He's actually quoted a couple times.

752
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,234
I can read it to you.

753
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,529
"'Everyone's been talking a lot about a
universal facebook within Harvard,' he says."

754
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,655
"He" meaning Mark.

755
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,698
"'I think it's kind of silly
that it would take the university

756
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:11,908
"'a couple of years to get around to it.

757
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,536
"'I can do a classierjob than they can
and I did it in a week."'

758
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,829
Tell him Divya Narendra called.

759
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,997
- I know, that's how he talks.
- Appreciate it.

760
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,166
"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,

761
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:24,003
"over 650 students had registered
to use thefacebook. Com.

762
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,674
"He said he anticipated that 900 students
would have joined the site by this morning."

763
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,010
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650
students signed up for it on the first day.

764
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:35,348
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't
give free drugs to 650 people in one day.

765
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,935
And this guy doesn't have three friends
to rub together to make a fourth.

766
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,520
All right.
Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss.

767
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,522
We'll put all this together
and we'll e-mail it to you.

768
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,357
Well, you won't be able
to go on the website yourself.

769
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,527
Because you don't have a Harvard...

770
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,946
You know what, it would just be easier
for us to e-mail it to you.

771
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,030
I'm sure you're right.

772
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,033
He's a good guy and he's very bright
and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...

773
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,201
Wow.

774
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,703
...what he did.

775
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,038
All right, thank you very much. And, Dad...

776
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,707
All right, love you, too.

777
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,543
- This is a good guy?
- We don't know that he's not a good guy.

778
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,627
We know he stole our idea.

779
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,129
We know he lied to our faces
for a month and a half.

780
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,381
- No, he never lied to our faces.
- Okay, he never saw our faces.

781
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,885
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts
and he gave himself a 42-day head start,

782
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,970
because he knows
what apparently you don't,

783
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,805
which is that getting there first
is everything.

784
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,890
I'm a competitive racer, Div.

785
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,393
I don't think you need to school me in the
importance of getting there first. Thank you.

786
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,812
- That was your father's lawyer?
- It was his in-house counsel.

787
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,814
He's gonna look at all this
and if he thinks it's appropriate

788
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:25,899
he'll send a cease-and-desist letter.

789
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,066
What's that gonna do?

790
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,485
What, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer
and sue him?

791
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,738
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer.

792
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:32,906
- We don't even have to do that.
- That's right.

793
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:36,326
We could do that ourselves.
I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me.

794
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,410
- I'm with this guy.
- Well, whatever.

795
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,913
I'm saying, let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

796
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,081
How much more information
are you waiting for?

797
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,001
We met with Mark three times,
we exchanged 52 e-mails,

798
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,669
we can prove that he looked at the code.

799
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,839
- What is that on the bottom of the page?
- It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production."

800
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,175
- On the home page?
- On every page.

801
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,928
Shit, I need a second to let
the classiness waft over me.

802
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,095
Okay, look, we don't know...

803
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,097
Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said
he hoped the privacy options

804
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,099
"would help restore his reputation

805
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,186
"following student outrage
over facemash. Com."

806
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:06,606
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us the finger in The Crimson.

807
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,359
While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer
to look this stuff over,

808
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,861
we can at least get something
going in the paper so people know...

809
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,446
- What?
...that this is in dispute.

810
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,615
We're not starting a knife fight
in The Crimson.

811
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,116
And we're not suing anybody.

812
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,535
Why not?

813
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,455
I don't understand, I don't understand.
Why not?

814
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,458
He's gonna say it's stupid.

815
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,543
What, who, me?

816
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,127
Say it. Why not?

817
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,714
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

818
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:36,135
This is Harvard, where you don't
plant stories and you don't sue people.

819
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,722
You thought he was gonna be
the only one who thought that was stupid?

820
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,475
During the time when you say
you had this idea,

821
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,646
did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

822
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,815
"A family of means"?

823
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,441
Did you know their father was wealthy?

824
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,986
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

825
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,321
It's not important you be sure
why I'm asking.

826
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,407
- It's not important to you.
- Sy.

827
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,326
Did you know that they came from money?

828
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,328
I had no idea whether
they came from money or not.

829
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,414
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra,

830
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,834
you referenced Howard Winklevoss'
consulting firm.

831
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,168
If you say so.

832
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:13,006
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose
assets are in the hundreds of millions.

833
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,341
You also knew Tyler and Cameron
were members

834
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,760
of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian.

835
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,095
They pointed that out.

836
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,180
- Excuse us for inviting you in.
- To the bike room.

837
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:25,268
Please. So it's safe to say you were aware
that my clients had money.

838
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:27,937
Yes.

839
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,439
Let me tell you why I'm asking.

840
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,942
I'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000
for an Internet venture,

841
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,611
you didn't ask my clients for it.

842
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,196
They had demonstrated an interest to you
in that kind of thing.

843
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:40,366
I went to my friend for the money because
that's who I wanted to be partners with.

844
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,952
Eduardo was the president of
the Harvard Investors Association,

845
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,996
and he was also my best friend.

846
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:49,459
Your best friend is suing you
for $600 million.

847
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,378
I didn't know that. Tell me more.

848
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,714
Eduardo, what happened
after the initial launch?

849
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,050
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr. Saverin?

850
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,801
- Gretchen, they're best friends.
- Not anymore.

851
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,887
Well, we already went through this on the...
Never mind.

852
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,640
Mr. Saverin, what happened
after the initial launch?

853
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,141
It exploded.

854
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,060
Everybody on campus was using it.

855
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,730
"Facebook me" was a common expression
after two weeks.

856
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,231
And Mark?

857
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:16,152
And Mark was the biggest thing on
a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates,

858
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:20,740
15 Pulitzer Prize winners,
two future Olympians, and a movie star.

859
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,492
Who was the movie star?

860
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,160
Does it matter?

861
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:25,578
No.

862
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:31,626
...at Out of Town News and picked up
that copy of PopularElectronics magazine

863
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,920
with the MITS Altair kit on the cover.

864
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,547
It was a beautiful day
and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room.

865
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,675
He brought that magazine up
and he showed it to me and he said,

866
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:42,637
"Look, it's gonna happen without us.
We've gotta start now."

867
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,890
And I said, "Okay.
Let's get BASIC out there."

868
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,352
Now, most of you think you know
the rest of the story, but you may not.

869
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,729
The beginnings of this industry
were very humble.

870
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:56,067
That kit computer on the cover of
that magazine had an 8080 processor in it.

871
00:44:56,151 --> 00:45:00,279
Unless you paid extra for
a 1 K memory board, you got 256 bytes.

872
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:04,784
So the challenge when I wrote BASIC
wasn't just to run at 4 k-bytes,

873
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:09,789
but I also had to leave room for the users
to run their programs in 4 k-bytes.

874
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,959
Your friend. Is that Mark Zuckerberg?

875
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,335
Yeah.

876
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,629
- He made The Facebook.
- Yeah.

877
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,298
I mean, it's both of ours. We're...

878
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,259
Yeah, we... Yes.

879
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,510
Cool.

880
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,262
I'm Christy Ling. This is Alice.

881
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,388
Hi.

882
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,682
Well, very nice to meet you.

883
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,517
Facebook me when you get home.

884
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,144
You know, maybe we can all go out
and grab a drink.

885
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:32,979
Certainly.

886
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,981
Absolutely do that.

887
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,949
She said, "Facebook me
and we can all go for a drink later,"

888
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,576
which is stunningly great for two reasons.

889
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,370
One, she said "facebook me," right?
And then the other is, well, you know...

890
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,496
They wanna have drinks later.

891
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,206
Yes, have you ever heard
so many different good things

892
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,833
packed into one regular-sized sentence?

893
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,626
Excuse me, Mark?

894
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,253
Yeah?

895
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,172
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your OS lab.

896
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,882
Sure.

897
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,217
- Awesome job with The Facebook.
- Awesome job.

898
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,343
Thanks.

899
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,262
- I'm Bob.
- How you doing?

900
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,764
You know, I could swear
he was looking at you

901
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:11,058
when he said the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room.

902
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,643
I doubt it.

903
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,271
And I showed up late.
I don't even know who the speaker was.

904
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,191
It was Bill Gates.

905
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,444
Shit, that makes sense.

906
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,363
All right. Thanks, guys.

907
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,576
- Are you a moron?
- Are you medically stupid?

908
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,369
You can't tell Bill Gates
is in front of you for an hour?

909
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,288
I wasn't wearing my contacts.

910
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,749
Can I get a Glock and kill you?

911
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,960
It's time to monetize the thing.

912
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,337
What were their names?

913
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,214
- Hear what I just said?
- When?

914
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,382
I said it's time to monetize the site.

915
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,384
What does that mean?

916
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,304
It means it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.

917
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,723
No, I know what the word means.
I'm asking how you wanna do it.

918
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,726
- Advertising.
- No.

919
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,270
Well, we got 4,000 members.

920
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,522
'Cause The Facebook is cool,

921
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,817
and if we start installing pop-ups
for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool.

922
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,527
Well, I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew,
but at some point,

923
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,071
and I'm talking as the business end
of the company, the site...

924
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,366
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know what it is.

925
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,910
We don't know what it can be.
We don't know what it will be.

926
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,328
We know that it is cool.

927
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,622
That is a priceless asset I'm not giving up.

928
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,916
- So when will it be finished?
- It won't be finished.

929
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,709
That's the point.
The way fashion's never finished.

930
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,087
- What?
- Fashion. Fashion is never finished.

931
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,630
You're talking about fashion? Really, you?

932
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,299
I'm talking about the idea of it
and I'm saying that it's never finished.

933
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,761
Okay. But they manage
to make money selling pants.

934
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,514
Mark, what is this?

935
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,057
- What?
- This.

936
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,434
It's called a cease-and-desist letter.
What were their names?

937
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,561
- Who?
- The girls.

938
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,812
When did you get this?

939
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,022
About 10 days ago.
Right after we launched the site.

940
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,941
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, the girls. What were their names?

941
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,152
The Winklevoss twins are saying
that you stole their idea.

942
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,613
I find that to be a little more
than mildly annoying.

943
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,950
Oh, well, they find it to be
intellectual property theft.

944
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,243
- Look...
- Why didn't you show this to me?

945
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,828
It was addressed to me.

946
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,039
They're saying that we stole The Facebook
from Divya Narendra and the Winklevosses.

947
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,166
- I know what it says.
- Did we?

948
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,293
Did we what?

949
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,961
Don't screw around with me now.
Look at me.

950
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,297
The letter says we could face legal action.

951
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,048
No, it says I could face legal action.

952
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,384
This is from a lawyer, Mark.
They must feel they have some grounds.

953
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:11,596
- The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
- Do they have grounds?

954
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,097
The grounds are
our thing is cool and popular,

955
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,599
and Harvard Connection is lame.

956
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,934
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code,
I promise.

957
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,060
I didn't use anything.

958
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,979
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair
doesn't owe money

959
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,689
to everyone who ever
has built a chair, okay?

960
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,608
They came to me with an idea,
I had a better one.

961
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,402
- Why didn't you show me this letter?
- I didn't think it was a big deal.

962
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,906
Okay.

963
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:36,829
So if there's something wrong, if there's
ever anything wrong, you can tell me.

964
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,540
I'm the guy that wants to help.
This is our thing.

965
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:43,085
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me?

966
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:44,629
No.

967
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,467
What are we doing about this?

968
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:52,970
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.

969
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,221
And what did you say?

970
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,433
"When we met in January,
I expressed my doubts about the site.

971
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,894
"Where it stood with graphics,
how much programing was left

972
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,395
"that I had not anticipated."

973
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,731
"The lack of hardware
we had to deal with site use,

974
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:07,068
"the lack of promotion that would go on
to successfully launch the website."

975
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:10,738
This was the first time you raised
any of those concerns, right?

976
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,448
I'd raised concerns before.

977
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,783
- Bullshit.
- Not to us.

978
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:17,912
Gentlemen, I'm talking about at the meeting
in January to which this letter is referring.

979
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,038
Yeah.

980
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,998
Let me rephrase this.

981
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,753
You sent my client 16 e-mails.
In the first 15 you didn't raise any concerns.

982
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:26,921
Is that a question?

983
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:30,549
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns
about the site's functionality.

984
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,386
- Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.

985
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,555
Then why didn't you raise
any of these concerns before?

986
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,516
- It's raining.
- I'm sorry?

987
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,850
It just started raining.

988
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:43,020
Mr. Zuckerberg,
do I have your full attention?

989
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:44,939
No.

990
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,400
Do you think I deserve it?

991
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,734
What?

992
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,779
Do you think I deserve your full attention?

993
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,365
I had to swear an oath
before we began this deposition

994
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:57,576
and I don't wanna perjure myself,
so I have a legal obligation to say no.

995
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,455
Okay. No.
You don't think I deserve your attention?

996
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,583
I think if your clients wanna sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall,

997
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,793
they have a right to give it a try,

998
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:09,213
but there's no requirement that I enjoy
sitting here listening to people lie.

999
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,717
You have part of my attention.
You have the minimum amount.

1000
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,012
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook,

1001
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,389
where my colleagues and I are doing things
that no one in this room,

1002
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,057
including and especially your clients,

1003
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:23,477
are intellectually or creatively
capable of doing.

1004
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,273
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?

1005
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,950
Well, I have 12:45.
Why don't we say that's lunch?

1006
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,245
Back at 2:30.

1007
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,206
So what were their names?

1008
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,002
Their names were Christy and Alice,

1009
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,090
and they wanna have drinks tonight.

1010
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,596
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is a men's room.

1011
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:03,809
Wow.

1012
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,241
Oh, my God.

1013
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,660
I don't care.

1014
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:44,850
Hey, man, sorry.

1015
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,853
A couple girls are freshening up in there.

1016
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,272
Sweet.

1017
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,403
We have groupies.

1018
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,205
I'll be right back.

1019
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,082
Mark, where you going? Mark.

1020
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,380
Erica?

1021
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,341
Hi.

1022
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:20,052
I saw you from over there.
I didn't know you came to this club a lot.

1023
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,846
- First time.
- Mine, too.

1024
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,806
Could I talk to you alone for a second?

1025
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,267
I think I'm good right here.

1026
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:30,396
I just... I'd love to talk to you alone
if we could just go someplace.

1027
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,730
Right here is fine.

1028
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,525
I don't know if you heard about
this new website I launched.

1029
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,693
No.

1030
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,280
- The Facebook?
- You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark.

1031
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,198
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1032
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,284
- On the Internet.
- That's why I came over.

1033
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,994
Comparing women to farm animals.

1034
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,954
I didn't end up doing that.

1035
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,706
It didn't stop you from writing it.

1036
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,375
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head was so clever

1037
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,752
it would be a crime for it not to be shared.

1038
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,882
The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark,
it's written in ink,

1039
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,885
and you published that Erica Albright
was a bitch,

1040
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:05,347
right before you made some ignorant crack
about my family's name, my bra size,

1041
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,266
and then rated women
based on their hotness.

1042
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,477
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

1043
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,689
You write your snide bullshit
from a dark room

1044
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,567
because that's what the angry do nowadays.

1045
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,612
I was nice to you. Don't torture me for it.

1046
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,655
If we could just go somewhere for a minute...

1047
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,949
I don't wanna be rude to my friends.

1048
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,452
Okay.

1049
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,623
Good luck with your video game.

1050
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,625
Hey, that was great.
That was the right thing to do.

1051
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,627
You apologized, right?

1052
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,631
We have to expand.

1053
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,132
Sure. Mark?

1054
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,053
Is he mad about something?

1055
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,306
Okay, we are expanding
to Yale and Columbia.

1056
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,099
Dustin, I want you to share
the coding work with me.

1057
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,976
Chris, you're gonna be in charge
of publicity and outreach,

1058
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,270
and you could start by getting a story
in the BU student newspaper.

1059
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,396
<i>It's The Bridge.</i>

1060
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,731
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

1061
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,733
Somebody at the newspaper
will be a computer science major.

1062
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,236
Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg
will do 10 hours of free programing.

1063
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,029
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?

1064
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,322
Because I do. Now here's the arrangement.

1065
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,407
Eduardo is CFO
and owns 30% of the company.

1066
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,034
Dustin is vice president
and head of programing,

1067
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,703
and his 5% of the company
will come from my end.

1068
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,080
Chris is director of publicity,

1069
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,540
and his compensation will depend on
how much work he ends up doing.

1070
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:14,667
Any questions?

1071
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:18,337
- Who are the girls?
- Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.

1072
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,713
- Hi.
- Hi.

1073
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,215
- Hello.
- Hi.

1074
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,133
Is there anything we can do?

1075
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,301
No, that's it.

1076
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,720
- Yale and Columbia, let's go.
- And Stanford.

1077
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,431
- What?
- Stanford.

1078
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,725
It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto.

1079
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,941
You don't want any lunch?

1080
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,109
No.

1081
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,194
You're welcome to some salad.

1082
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,821
No, thank you.

1083
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,161
This must be hard.

1084
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,747
Who are you?

1085
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,834
I'm Marylin Delpy.
I introduced myself when we first...

1086
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,294
I mean, what do you do?

1087
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,504
I'm a second-year associate at the firm.

1088
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,173
My boss wanted me to sit in
on the deposition phase.

1089
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:05,968
What are you doing?

1090
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:09,054
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.

1091
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,389
Bosnia.

1092
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,684
They don't have roads,
but they have Facebook.

1093
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:21,358
You must really hate the Winklevosses.

1094
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,444
I don't hate anybody.

1095
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:27,948
The Winklevi aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.

1096
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,576
They are suing me because
for the first time in their lives,

1097
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,078
things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.

1098
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,212
He's expanding.

1099
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,464
What?

1100
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:44,965
He's expanding
to Yale, Columbia and Stanford.

1101
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,216
It's gonna be in The Crimson tomorrow.

1102
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,343
- Really?
- Yep.

1103
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,679
Well, looks like that cease-and-desist letter
really scared the shit out of him, huh?

1104
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:54,058
I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive
relief and get the site taken down now.

1105
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:57,102
Every minute the site is up,
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.

1106
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,980
I want an injunction. I want damages.
I want punitive relief.

1107
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,106
And I want him dead.

1108
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,274
Yeah, I want those things, too.

1109
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,650
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?

1110
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,027
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?

1111
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,820
No, it's because you're not thinking
how it's gonna look.

1112
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:07,946
How's it gonna look?

1113
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,239
Like my brother and I
are in skeleton costumes

1114
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,575
chasing the Karate Kid
around a high school gym.

1115
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:15,287
Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law.

1116
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,206
When he goes to Connecticut,
New York and California,

1117
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,624
he'll have violated federal law.

1118
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,501
And, by the way,
he's in violation of Harvard law.

1119
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,503
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1120
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:25,089
Wait. Yeah, there is.

1121
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,512
Harvard Student Handbook.

1122
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:34,390
Every freshman is issued one of these,
and somewhere in this book it says...

1123
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,891
You can't steal from another student.

1124
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,603
This is what we needed.
We're going to Summers.

1125
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,563
Well, you can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

1126
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,482
My brother and I,
we pay tuition at this school.

1127
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,777
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school.
We've won trophies for this school.

1128
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:49,321
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics
for this school.

1129
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,866
I want a meeting with
the goddamn president of this school.

1130
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,451
Why Stanford?

1131
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,328
Why do you think?

1132
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,959
I'm sorry.

1133
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,627
I'm late for biochem.

1134
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,338
Okay.

1135
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,426
You don't know my name, do you?

1136
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,261
Is it Stanford?

1137
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,930
I should just kick your ass.

1138
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,182
How do you go to a party
and you meet someone...

1139
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:20,519
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda.

1140
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,772
Your father's in commercial real estate
and your mother's 10 years sober.

1141
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,441
What's my major?

1142
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,526
- Trombone.
- Really?

1143
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,028
I remember something about a trombone.

1144
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,117
French.

1145
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,285
Your major's French.

1146
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,036
- And yours?
- Mine?

1147
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,330
- I don't have one.
- You haven't declared?

1148
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,791
I don't go to school.

1149
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,710
- You're kidding.
- No.

1150
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,045
Well, where did you go to school?

1151
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,465
William Taft Elementary, for a little while.

1152
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,632
Seriously?

1153
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,635
You're not like 15 years old or anything,
are you?

1154
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,387
No.

1155
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,139
Wait, you're not like 15, are you?

1156
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,348
No.

1157
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,560
So, what do you do?

1158
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,313
I'm an entrepreneur.

1159
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,899
- You're unemployed.
- I wouldn't say that.

1160
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,066
What would you say?

1161
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,318
That I'm an entrepreneur.

1162
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,069
Well, then, what was your latest preneur?

1163
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:15,824
Well, I founded an Internet company that
let folks download and share music for free.

1164
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,242
Kind of like Napster?

1165
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,744
Exactly like Napster.

1166
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,496
What do you mean?

1167
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,914
I founded Napster.

1168
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,999
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1169
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,417
Nice to meet you.

1170
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,336
You're Sean Parker?

1171
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,254
You see, the shoe's on the other...

1172
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,423
- Foot?
- Table, which has turned.

1173
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,259
I just slept with Sean Parker?

1174
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,053
You just slept on Sean Parker.

1175
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,680
- You're a zillionaire.
- Not technically.

1176
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,265
What are you?

1177
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,601
Broke. There's not
a lot of money in free music,

1178
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:46,021
even less when you're being sued by
everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.

1179
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,606
This is blowing my mind.

1180
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,690
I appreciate that.

1181
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,609
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

1182
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:54,112
Biochem, even though you're
a French major whose name is Amy.

1183
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,864
You passed.

1184
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,282
I'm a hard worker.

1185
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:02,621
There's juice or anything else you can find.
Help yourself.

1186
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:03,789
You mind if I check my e-mail?

1187
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,958
Yeah, go ahead.

1188
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,135
Amy!

1189
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:20,472
Jesus.

1190
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,891
- Amy! Can you come out here?
- Yeah?

1191
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,269
Just a second.

1192
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,731
There's a snake in here, Amy.

1193
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,899
What?

1194
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,403
Where?

1195
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,904
There isn't a snake,
but I need to ask you something.

1196
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,990
Are you kidding me? I could've been killed.

1197
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,241
How?

1198
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:43,078
By running too fast
and getting twisted in the curtain.

1199
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,830
What do you need to ask me?

1200
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:47,749
Yeah, I went to check my e-mail and
there's a website open on your computer.

1201
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:52,087
Yeah, after you passed out last night
I went on The Facebook for a little bit.

1202
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,339
- What's that?
- The Facebook?

1203
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:57,426
Stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now.

1204
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:00,762
It's really awesome,
except it's freakishly addictive.

1205
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,181
Seriously, I'm on the thing
like five times a day.

1206
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,766
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?

1207
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,351
Yeah, is everything okay?

1208
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:08,270
Everything's great.

1209
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:13,275
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.

1210
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,780
I've never been in this building before.

1211
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:23,201
This building's 100 years older
than the country it's in, so do be careful.

1212
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,204
We're sitting in chairs.

1213
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,165
Yes.

1214
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,376
Very good. You can go in now.

1215
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,634
That's their own stupidity.
I should've been there.

1216
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,302
Well, darkness is the absence of light,

1217
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:43,221
and the stupidity in that instance
was the absence of me.

1218
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,223
Catherine, I've got students
in my office now.

1219
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,225
Students. Undergrads.

1220
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,810
I don't know.

1221
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,647
From the looks of it, they want
to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.

1222
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:52,981
All right, bye-bye.

1223
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:54,900
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

1224
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,902
I'm Cameron Winklevoss
and this is my brother, Tyler.

1225
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,071
And you're here because...

1226
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:01,573
Either of you can answer.

1227
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,158
I'm sorry, sir,
I thought you were reading the letter.

1228
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,326
I've read the letter.

1229
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,663
Well, we came up with an idea for
a website called Harvard Connection...

1230
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,916
We've since changed the name to ConnectU.
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...

1231
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,417
I understand.

1232
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:15,003
And I'm asking what you want me
to do about it.

1233
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:19,007
Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman,

1234
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,426
under the heading "Standards of Conduct
in the Harvard Community,"

1235
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:25,180
it says the college expects all students
to be honest and forthcoming

1236
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:27,683
in their dealings with members
in this community.

1237
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:30,268
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership,

1238
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,771
and instances of theft, misappropriation or...

1239
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,356
- Anne?
- Yes, sir?

1240
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,274
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.

1241
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:43,198
...or unauthorized use
will result in disciplinary action,

1242
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,283
including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.

1243
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,452
And you memorized that
instead of doing what?

1244
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:50,956
What my brother and I came here today
to ask of you, respectfully, of course...

1245
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:54,209
Sir, it's against university rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.

1246
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:55,544
And you've spoken to your House Master?

1247
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:57,963
Yes, sir. And the House Master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board,

1248
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,631
but the Ad Board won't see us.

1249
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,550
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?

1250
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:04,469
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding
to any of our e-mails or phone calls

1251
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:05,637
for the last two weeks.

1252
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,556
He doesn't answer when
we knock on his door at Kirkland,

1253
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,474
and the closest I've come
to dealing with him face-to-face

1254
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,893
is when I saw him on the quad
and chased him through Harvard Square.

1255
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,061
You chased him?

1256
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,731
I saw him and I know he saw me.
I went after him and then he disappeared.

1257
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:19,901
- I don't see this as a university issue.
- Of course this is a university issue.

1258
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:22,404
There's a code of ethics and an honor code
and he violated them both.

1259
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:25,949
You enter into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.

1260
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,995
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what
you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1261
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,246
I'm devastated by that.

1262
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,999
What my brother means is, if
Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room

1263
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,251
and stole our computer,
that would be a university issue.

1264
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:38,670
I really don't know.
This office doesn't handle petty larceny.

1265
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,088
This isn't petty larceny.

1266
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,340
This idea is potentially worth
millions of dollars.

1267
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,592
- Millions?
- Yes.

1268
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:46,261
You might just be letting
your imaginations run away with you.

1269
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:49,181
Sir, I honestly don't think you're
in any position to make that call.

1270
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:53,518
I was the US Treasury Secretary.
I'm in some position to make that call.

1271
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:54,936
Letting our imaginations run away with us

1272
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,938
is exactly what we were told to do
in your freshman address.

1273
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,025
Well, then I would suggest
that you let your imaginations

1274
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,443
run away with you on a new project.

1275
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:02,694
You would?

1276
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,196
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's
inventing something.

1277
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:08,950
Harvard undergraduates believe that
inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1278
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,788
So I'll suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new new project.

1279
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,957
- I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.
- Please, arrive at the point.

1280
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,793
You don't have to be
an intellectual property expert

1281
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,377
to understand the difference
between right and wrong.

1282
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,296
And you're saying that I don't?

1283
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,381
- Of course I'm not saying that, sir.
- I'm saying that.

1284
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,175
- Really?
- Sir.

1285
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,302
Anne, how did they get this appointment?

1286
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:29,304
Colleagues of their father.

1287
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,141
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,

1288
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,644
since you're on the subject
of right and wrong.

1289
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:39,981
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here is wrong.

1290
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:43,568
It's not worthy of Harvard.
It's not what Harvard saw in you.

1291
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,071
You don't get special treatment.

1292
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,657
- We never asked...
- Just start another project?

1293
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,575
Like we're making a diorama
for a science fair?

1294
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,160
If you have a problem
with that, Mr. Winklevoss...

1295
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,328
We never asked for special treatment.

1296
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:57,082
...the courts are always at your disposal.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

1297
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,834
You can take the Harvard
Student Handbook and shove it...

1298
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,001
Ty.

1299
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,879
Thank you very much for your time, sir.

1300
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,386
Whoops.

1301
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:12,097
Broke your 335-year-old doorknob.

1302
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,852
Eduardo, spring break, you
and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1303
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,521
- Yes.
- What was the purpose of the trip?

1304
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:23,275
Well, as CFO, I had set up some meetings
with potential advertisers.

1305
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,110
Who paid for the trip?

1306
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:28,280
It was paid for out of the $1,000 account
I had set up a few months earlier.

1307
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:32,200
At this point, your $1,000 was the only
money that had been put into the company?

1308
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,286
- Yes.
- How did you feel the meetings went?

1309
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,873
- They went terribly.
- Why?

1310
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:39,207
Mark was asleep.

1311
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,709
I was not asleep.

1312
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,127
Can I rephrase my answer?

1313
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,296
I wish he'd been asleep.

1314
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:50,594
So we're in 29 schools now,
with over 75,000 members.

1315
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,554
People who go on The Facebook

1316
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:55,056
tend to stay on longer
than almost any other website.

1317
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,892
Now, here's the most impressive statistic.

1318
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,978
91% of people who try it once
will come back.

1319
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,938
- Now, if you'll allow me...
- Excuse me one second.

1320
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,399
What sound is he making? Is that like a tsk?

1321
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,070
It wasn't a tsk.

1322
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,572
It was...

1323
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,325
Like a glottal stop.

1324
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,660
Almost a gag reflex.

1325
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:18,997
Guys, what is this?

1326
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,750
There was one more meeting scheduled
for the New York trip.

1327
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,168
Yes, it was a dinner.

1328
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,669
It was set up through
my girlfriend at the time.

1329
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,839
Would you say that Mark was
excited about this meeting?

1330
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,175
Yes. Very.

1331
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,260
- Look, they're not gonna card us.
- They might.

1332
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,179
- I mean, look around.
- It'll be embarrassing.

1333
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:37,098
- Tell him they're not gonna card us.
- They're not gonna card us.

1334
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,100
- Mark...
- Are you gonna talk about ads again?

1335
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,936
Unless you're the ballet theater of Hartford,

1336
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,021
the purpose of a business
is to make a profit.

1337
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,272
It isn't a business yet.

1338
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:48,151
That's tough for me, 'cause my...
Never mind.

1339
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,530
He's 25 minutes late.

1340
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,367
He founded Napster when he was 19.
He can be late.

1341
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,118
- He's not a god.
- Then what is he?

1342
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,703
He's 25 minutes late.

1343
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,038
I think Wardo's jealous.

1344
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,333
I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous.

1345
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:04,542
Why?

1346
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:08,129
Well, I didn't know him at all, but I had
done a search and I'd asked around.

1347
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:11,508
And he struck me as kind of a...

1348
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:14,844
A wild card.

1349
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,054
Why?

1350
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,474
He crashed out of two pretty big
Internet companies in spectacular fashion,

1351
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:20,976
he's had a reputation with drugs...

1352
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,310
He also founded the companies.

1353
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,728
We don't need him.

1354
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:25,397
He's here.

1355
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:30,151
No, no, take your time.

1356
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,988
- And he does own a watch.
- Stop it.

1357
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:36,074
- I'm Sean Parker.
- How do you do?

1358
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:39,077
You must be Eduardo. And Christy.
And Mark.

1359
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:41,162
- Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

1360
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,747
You guys don't have anything
in front of you.

1361
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:43,915
- No.
- Tori.

1362
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
We were waiting.

1363
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,252
- Hey, baby boy.
- Can you bring out some things?

1364
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:50,171
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit.
Tuna tartare?

1365
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,090
And the lobster claws, that'll get us started.

1366
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:54,092
Christy, what do you like to drink?

1367
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,928
An appletini.

1368
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,055
Great. Four of those.

1369
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:02,434
From that point on, it was a Seanathon.

1370
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,945
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"

1371
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,709
He took us through his episode
with Napster.

1372
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,795
I didn't wanna spend my 20s
as a professional defendant.

1373
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:33,965
Who knew? The music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor.

1374
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:37,302
We tried to sell the company to pay the
35 million they said we owed in royalties,

1375
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:41,890
but I guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.

1376
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,060
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy.

1377
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,812
- But you made a name for yourself.
- And you are dry.

1378
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,647
- Tori!
- No, no, I'm good.

1379
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,941
And then he went on to
his second business venture,

1380
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,653
which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

1381
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,739
And I wanted to do it nice this time.

1382
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:01,743
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes,
but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.

1383
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:04,746
So let me tell you what happens to
a 20-year-old at the top of a hot dot-com.

1384
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,999
- I'm not a psychiatrist, but...
- I'm glad we've got that on the record.

1385
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,335
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

1386
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:13,296
A psychiatrist would say
that he was paranoid.

1387
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,924
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

1388
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:18,093
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

1389
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:20,512
I can't prove it,
but I know they tap my phones.

1390
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,181
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up,
you've done already.

1391
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:25,850
Private behavior is a relic
of a time gone by.

1392
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,770
And if somehow, someway, you've managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama,

1393
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,021
they'll make shit up.

1394
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:32,690
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

1395
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:34,526
And they want you
to say "thank you" while you...

1396
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:36,027
Excuse me.

1397
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,529
...wipe your chin and walk away.

1398
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:38,696
That's what happened to you?

1399
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:40,365
And delusional.

1400
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:44,119
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.

1401
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,787
I brought down the record companies
with Napster

1402
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,205
and Case'll suffer for their sins, too.

1403
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,791
Sorry, you didn't bring down
the record companies.

1404
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,209
They won.

1405
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,044
- In court.
- Yeah.

1406
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,964
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?

1407
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:01,803
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,

1408
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:05,890
and parties at Stanford and down in LA,
and friends who'd become millionaires...

1409
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:10,895
But mostly how Mark had to...
He had to come to California.

1410
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,149
And then he got around to The Facebook.

1411
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,734
So, tell me about your progress.

1412
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:20,405
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members.

1413
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,240
- Tell me about the strategy you're using.
- Okay.

1414
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,325
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,

1415
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,244
but Baylor already had
a social network on campus.

1416
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,912
So instead of going right after them,

1417
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:30,081
we made a list of every school
within 100 miles...

1418
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,249
You put The Facebook
on those campuses first.

1419
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:34,169
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw
their friends on our site and we were in.

1420
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:35,587
It's called the Little Bighorn.
That's smart, Mark.

1421
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,088
- Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.

1422
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,923
Hey, you know what?
Settle an argument for us.

1423
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,925
I say it's time to start making money
from The Facebook,

1424
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:42,927
but Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

1425
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,262
Well...

1426
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,181
Neither of you yet.

1427
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:48,600
The Facebook is cool,
that's what it's got going for it.

1428
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:49,767
Yeah.

1429
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,519
You don't wanna ruin it with ads
because ads aren't cool.

1430
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:52,687
Exactly.

1431
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:54,272
It's like you're throwing
the greatest party on campus

1432
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,607
and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11:00.

1433
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:56,774
That's exactly right.

1434
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,027
- You don't even know what the thing is yet.
- Exactly.

1435
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:02,822
How big it can get, how far it can go.
This is no time to take your chips down.

1436
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,824
A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?

1437
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:05,950
You?

1438
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,079
"A billion dollars."

1439
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,293
And that shut everybody up.

1440
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:18,463
And that's where you're headed.
A billion-dollar valuation.

1441
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,883
Unless you take bad advice, in which case
you may as well have come up with

1442
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:23,801
a chain of very successful yogurt shops.

1443
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:28,014
When you go fishing, you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

1444
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:31,392
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?

1445
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,311
- No, he's holding a 3,000-pound marlin.
- Yep.

1446
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:34,479
- That's a good analogy.
- Okay.

1447
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,940
But we all know marlins don't really
weigh 3,000 pounds, right?

1448
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,066
Have you seen the big ones up close?

1449
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,110
No, but I don't think the guy's holding
a marlin the size of a Range Rover.

1450
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:43,821
That would be a really big fish
and a very strong guy.

1451
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,448
You think we might be getting away
from the point?

1452
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:49,827
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

1453
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,746
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1454
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:55,041
He picked up the check,
he told Mark they'd talk again soon,

1455
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,209
and he was gone.

1456
01:10:56,293 --> 01:11:00,171
But not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.

1457
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:05,009
Drop the "The." Just "Facebook."

1458
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,136
It's cleaner.

1459
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,099
Shit.

1460
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:14,852
Goodbye, sweetie.

1461
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:17,105
Yeah.

1462
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:23,903
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.

1463
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,155
You wanna end the party at 11:00.

1464
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:30,368
- I'm trying to pay for the party.
- There won't be a party unless it's cool.

1465
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:32,662
So, what do you think?

1466
01:11:32,746 --> 01:11:34,706
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The."

1467
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,917
I meant to catching the marlin
instead of the 14 trout.

1468
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,294
Doesn't that sound good?

1469
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,087
If you're a trout.

1470
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:42,714
I'm going to enter this into the record.

1471
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:46,718
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
an LLC registered in Florida.

1472
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,886
- Why Florida?
- It's where my family lives.

1473
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,556
And ask the respondent to stipulate
that the articles of incorporation

1474
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:55,393
state the ownership as follows:
65% for Mark Zuckerberg,

1475
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:58,604
30% for Eduardo Saverin
and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.

1476
01:11:58,689 --> 01:11:59,772
Yeah, we stipulate.

1477
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:02,734
- And that was April 13th, 2004.
- You can mark it.

1478
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,444
You have anything here?

1479
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:05,820
Yes. Thank you.

1480
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:08,614
Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything

1481
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,284
that might be considered
legitimate grounds for termination?

1482
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,162
No.

1483
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:18,791
You never did anything to embarrass the
company or even seriously jeopardize it?

1484
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:20,793
- No.
- No?

1485
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:25,423
No.

1486
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:27,675
You were accused of animal cruelty.

1487
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:31,721
- Wait.
- You weren't?

1488
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:34,057
This is not happening.

1489
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,476
I have here an article from The Crimson...

1490
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,643
Jesus Christ.

1491
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:38,770
I can't have this, Wardo.

1492
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:42,315
Come on, man. This is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.

1493
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,110
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.

1494
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,821
I'd been accepted,
and as part of my initiation I had to,

1495
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:52,909
for one week, carry with me at all times
and take care of a chicken.

1496
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:55,620
They identify you
as one of the founders of Facebook.

1497
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,080
"Junior Eduardo Saverin..."

1498
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:59,123
I'm not the expert, but being connected
to torturing animals

1499
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,541
is probably bad for business.

1500
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:05,463
I did not torture the chicken.
I don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?

1501
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:09,384
No, and settle down, please.
I have here an article from The Crimson...

1502
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:11,260
- This is scathing.
- 956.

1503
01:13:11,428 --> 01:13:14,180
I was having dinner in
the Kirkland dining hall with Mark,

1504
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:15,973
and I had the chicken with me,

1505
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,059
because I had to have the chicken
with me at all times.

1506
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:19,227
This was college.

1507
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:21,396
- Somebody's gonna have to answer for this.
- 969.

1508
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:24,023
And the dining hall
was serving chicken for dinner,

1509
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,526
and I had to feed my chicken, so I...

1510
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:29,821
Well, I took little pieces of chicken
and I gave it to the chicken.

1511
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,073
Someone must have seen me,
because the next thing I knew

1512
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:33,866
I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

1513
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,328
I didn't know you couldn't do that.

1514
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,747
I dealt with the various animal rights groups,

1515
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,041
I dealt with the associate dean
of the college.

1516
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:44,001
This was all resolved.

1517
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,128
988.

1518
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:47,255
Someone from the Porc or the Fly
must have reported it.

1519
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:49,173
For all I know, it was the Winklevosses.

1520
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,967
All right, let's just forget about it.

1521
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:54,011
This is absurd.
I'm being accused of animal cruelty.

1522
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,555
It's better to be accused of necrophilia.

1523
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:57,265
It is better to be accused of necrophilia.

1524
01:13:57,349 --> 01:14:00,726
Now I have to explain this to my father.
I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody.

1525
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,228
What is happening on that?

1526
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:04,397
I have my final coming up
for Postwar and Contemporary Art

1527
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:05,731
and I haven't been to class.

1528
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:07,066
I'm supposed to write about
these four paintings.

1529
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,776
That's a Facebook page?

1530
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:09,902
Yeah. I opened it under an alias.

1531
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,404
I posted the paintings
and asked people to comment.

1532
01:14:11,488 --> 01:14:14,490
Every once in a while, I hop on
and stir the pot to get a good debate going.

1533
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:16,993
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating
on his final exam?

1534
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:19,871
- I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
- And why not?

1535
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:22,707
Because I'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.

1536
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,960
- That's not what friends do.
- Well, you just told us he was cheating.

1537
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:27,920
Oops.

1538
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:32,216
You told your lawyers
I was torturing animals?

1539
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,926
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1540
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:36,762
Our litigators are capable
of finding a Crimson article.

1541
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:39,557
In fact, when we raised the subject with him,
he defended you.

1542
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,060
Oops.

1543
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,521
993. We are so close.

1544
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:49,317
Yeah, that reminds me,
we're gonna need more money, Wardo.

1545
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:51,444
Yeah, no, I agree. More servers, more help.

1546
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:53,279
I'm interviewing two interns
to come to Palo Alto

1547
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:54,447
and we're gonna have
to pay them something.

1548
01:14:54,531 --> 01:14:56,491
- Sorry, what?
- I already found a house for rent

1549
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:58,326
on a street
two blocks from the Stanford campus.

1550
01:14:58,410 --> 01:14:59,744
It is perfect and it's got a pool.

1551
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,829
When did you decide to go to California
for the summer?

1552
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,164
You mean when did I actually decide?

1553
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:06,417
Was it somewhere in the middle
of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1554
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:09,045
He was right,
California's the place we've gotta be.

1555
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:10,546
What, you're Jed Clampett?

1556
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:12,673
<i>I didn't know you guys
got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil.</i>

1557
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:14,425
Yeah, got the show in Brazil, it was genius.

1558
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:17,845
- What is your problem with Sean?
- He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1559
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,972
He doesn't have money.
Dustin's a better programmer.

1560
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:23,643
- He's got connections to VCs.
- We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.

1561
01:15:23,727 --> 01:15:25,645
- And I have connections to VCs.
- No real players.

1562
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:28,314
And as somebody who's just really
embarrassed the company in a bad way...

1563
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:30,608
- It was the Winklevosses, Mark.
- Hang on.

1564
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:32,151
Hit "Refresh."

1565
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:35,988
150,004.

1566
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,449
150,000 members, Wardo.

1567
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:40,159
- Congratulations, dude.
- Congratulations.

1568
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:44,705
You don't think it was strange that
he was followed by private detectives?

1569
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,457
Who came up with nothing.

1570
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,501
Enough to get him out of the company.
The drugs, the girls.

1571
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:50,711
- We don't know that any of that's true.
- You can read about it.

1572
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:52,338
I can read about you torturing birds.
Since when...

1573
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:56,092
Okay, don't fish eat other fish?
The marlins and the trout?

1574
01:15:58,595 --> 01:15:59,637
What's he talking about?

1575
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:02,390
I'm interviewing interns at 10:00
tomorrow night in the CS lab.

1576
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:03,641
Get on board with this, man.

1577
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:06,269
You know, I don't really know
what else to say.

1578
01:16:29,626 --> 01:16:32,003
You can do one more! One more!

1579
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:37,758
Wardo!

1580
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:39,135
Yo! Mark!

1581
01:16:41,054 --> 01:16:42,096
What's going on?

1582
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,557
They have 10 minutes to get root access
to a Python web server,

1583
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:45,933
expose its SSL encryption,

1584
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,643
and then intercept all traffic
over its secure port.

1585
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:48,811
They're hacking.

1586
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:50,938
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator.
But here's the beauty.

1587
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,857
You know I didn't understand
anything you just said, right?

1588
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,066
- I do know that.
- So what's the beauty?

1589
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:56,068
Every tenth line of code written,
they have to drink a shot.

1590
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:59,155
Hacking's supposed to be stealth,
so every time the server detects an intrusion,

1591
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:01,073
the candidate responsible
has to drink a shot.

1592
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,867
I also have a program running
that has a pop-up window

1593
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,785
appear simultaneously on all five computers.

1594
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,871
The last candidate to hit the window
has to drink a shot.

1595
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:09,081
Plus, every three minutes
they all have to drink a shot.

1596
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,626
- Three minutes!
- Drink one now!

1597
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:15,338
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's job
will they need to be able to do drunk?

1598
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,464
You're right.

1599
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:19,842
A more relevant test might be seeing
if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1600
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,554
- That was mean.
- Here.

1601
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:24,764
What is this?

1602
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:27,933
I opened a new account
and put $18,000 in it.

1603
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:31,270
Will that get you through the summer?

1604
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:32,396
- Here!
- Mark?

1605
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:33,898
Right here!

1606
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:40,905
Welcome to Facebook.

1607
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:51,999
- $18,000?
- Yes.

1608
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,418
In addition to the $1,000
you'd already put up.

1609
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,088
- Yes.
- A total of $19,000 now.

1610
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:58,422
- Yes.
- Hang on.

1611
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,051
I'm just checking your math on that.

1612
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:04,470
Yes, I got the same thing.

1613
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,138
May I continue?

1614
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:09,642
After expressing misgivings
about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company

1615
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:11,769
and moving it to California for the summer,

1616
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:14,855
why did you put $18,000
in an account for his use?

1617
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:18,693
I figured we were partners.
I wanted to be a team player.

1618
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:21,862
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns
could work on the site

1619
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:24,407
while I was generating
advertiser interest in New York.

1620
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:29,036
But mostly I figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?

1621
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,623
Go, go, go, go, go.

1622
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:38,838
- I didn't die.
- I know.

1623
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:40,756
- I made it.
- You did.

1624
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,509
Okay, ready?

1625
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:45,845
- That was like an 8.
- That was like a 2.

1626
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:48,305
- It was better than that.
- Yeah.

1627
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:58,023
I'm okay.

1628
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,358
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1629
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,068
Yikes.

1630
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:03,821
That's the doorbell.

1631
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,114
I didn't know we had a doorbell.

1632
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:07,908
- Andrew, get the door!
- No, he's wired in.

1633
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,994
That's gonna cut into your security deposit.

1634
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,164
- Andrew.
- Not now.

1635
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:14,582
Good boy.

1636
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:20,045
- Sean?
- Mark?

1637
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,089
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

1638
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:23,424
Do you?

1639
01:19:23,508 --> 01:19:25,050
We were right across the street.
We saw the chimney...

1640
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:27,720
- Is anybody hurt?
- No. You live across the street?

1641
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,306
I'm Sharon.

1642
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,725
This is my... Sharon.
She lives across the street.

1643
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,143
I was helping her move out,
we saw the chimney...

1644
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:36,187
We had a zip line to the pool.

1645
01:19:37,063 --> 01:19:39,523
You came to California.

1646
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,025
Yeah.

1647
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,235
You made the right choice.

1648
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:50,201
Here you go.

1649
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:55,915
Sharon?

1650
01:19:58,376 --> 01:19:59,376
I'm so sorry.

1651
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,503
- No problem.
- I didn't know you were gonna...

1652
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:02,630
- Here you go.
- No, no, no. Wait!

1653
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:08,093
This house and this team are great.
It's exactly what it should be.

1654
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:10,221
I'm Sean Parker.

1655
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:11,430
Oh, he's wired in.

1656
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,641
That's what I'm talking about.

1657
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:16,352
Where's Eduardo?

1658
01:20:16,436 --> 01:20:18,938
He got an internship in New York.

1659
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:20,981
Eduardo didn't come out?

1660
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:44,296
I was crashing there for a little bit
while I'm taking care of some things,

1661
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:47,842
but she's done for the summer
so she's back at her parents' place.

1662
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:51,387
- The homeless rock star of Palo Alto.
- All right.

1663
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:53,931
What's your plan for the summer?

1664
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,308
Mark?

1665
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:59,103
I'm sorry. I was looking at the architecture.

1666
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:01,772
I asked what your plan for the...

1667
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,357
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer.

1668
01:21:03,441 --> 01:21:05,192
- We're gonna go to the restroom.
- Okay.

1669
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:07,319
Yeah, I'll go with you.

1670
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:12,449
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1671
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,118
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

1672
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:15,452
What do you mean?

1673
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:20,833
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie,

1674
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:23,752
but he's too embarrassed
to shop for it in a department store.

1675
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,671
He comes up with an idea
for a high-end place

1676
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:28,090
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1677
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:32,177
He gets a $40,000 bank loan,
borrows another 40,000 from his in-laws,

1678
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:35,264
opens a store and calls it Victoria's Secret.

1679
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:38,058
Makes a half million dollars his first year.

1680
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:41,979
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores,
and after five years, he sells the company

1681
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:45,316
to Leslie Wexner and The Limited
for $4 million.

1682
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:46,650
Happy ending, right?

1683
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:51,447
Except two years later,
the company's worth $500 million,

1684
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:54,825
and Roy Raymond jumps off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

1685
01:21:57,037 --> 01:22:00,831
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife
a pair of thigh-highs, you know?

1686
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,417
Was that a parable?

1687
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:08,422
My date's a Victoria's Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.

1688
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:09,965
- God.
- Don't be impressed by all this.

1689
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,300
I read your blog.

1690
01:22:11,384 --> 01:22:13,427
You know, no, that was for web cretins.

1691
01:22:13,511 --> 01:22:15,179
You know why I started Napster?

1692
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:21,143
The girl I loved in high school was with
the co-captain of the varsity lacrosse team,

1693
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:23,270
and I wanted to take her from him.

1694
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,272
So I decided to come up with
the next big thing.

1695
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:28,233
- I didn't know that.
- Napster wasn't a failure.

1696
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,779
I changed the music industry
for better and for always.

1697
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:36,116
It may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.

1698
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,661
And isn't that what your Facemash
was about?

1699
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:41,413
They're scared of me, pal,
and they're gonna be scared of you.

1700
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:43,290
What the VCs want is to say,

1701
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:46,210
"Good idea, kid,
the grown-ups will take it from here."

1702
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:48,921
But not this time. This is our time.

1703
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:52,841
This time, you're gonna hand them
a business card that says,

1704
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:54,635
"I'm CEO, bitch."

1705
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:57,721
That's what I want for you.

1706
01:22:58,431 --> 01:23:00,057
So where the hell is Eduardo?

1707
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:03,686
- He's in New York.
- Sucking up to ad execs.

1708
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,729
- He's got an...
- An internship.

1709
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:10,401
The company's here.
A billion-dollar company's here.

1710
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,362
- Do you live and breathe Facebook?
- Yes.

1711
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:14,571
I know you do.

1712
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:17,741
Wardo wants to be a businessman
and for all I know he's gonna be a good one,

1713
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,577
but he shouldn't be in New York
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

1714
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:25,749
This is a once-in-a-generation,
"holy shit" idea.

1715
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:29,753
And the water under
the Golden Gate is freezing cold.

1716
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:35,592
Look at my face and tell me
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1717
01:23:37,303 --> 01:23:38,846
Do you ever think about that girl?

1718
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:39,972
What girl?

1719
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:43,434
The girl from high school
with the lacrosse thing.

1720
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:45,769
No.

1721
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:49,398
If you guys are gonna talk about bandwidth,
we need shots.

1722
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:50,983
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer?

1723
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:52,109
Yeah.

1724
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,569
Tell you what. Gesture of good faith.

1725
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:58,115
While you're getting into 100 schools,
I'll put you on two continents.

1726
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:00,367
Two...

1727
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:06,290
If you don't have a place to crash,

1728
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,667
I think you should definitely
come and live with us.

1729
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:11,545
Let's line up some shots.

1730
01:24:11,629 --> 01:24:13,756
- Excuse me!
- Yes, sir.

1731
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,967
You can take this away
and bring back the 1942.

1732
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,969
Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

1733
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:38,155
Attention... Go!

1734
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:59,510
<i>At the barrier, Hollandia is
leading Harvard University by one length.</i>

1735
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:10,521
<i>Approaching the grandstands,</i>

1736
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:13,732
<i>Hollandia maintains a lead
of three-quarters of a length.</i>

1737
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,205
Come on!

1738
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,203
Whatever.

1739
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:14,918
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- Tyler.

1740
01:26:15,044 --> 01:26:16,879
- Tremendous race.
- Thank you.

1741
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:19,214
- And this is my brother, Cameron.
- Excellent.

1742
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:20,340
Sir?

1743
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,134
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.

1744
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,011
Your Highness, this is
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

1745
01:26:24,095 --> 01:26:27,431
Of course. Brilliant race.
I've never seen a race that close.

1746
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:28,557
Yes, Your Highness.

1747
01:26:28,641 --> 01:26:31,685
My grandfather, Jack Kelly,
was one of the premier rowers of his day.

1748
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:35,230
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years
and I'd never seen a race that close.

1749
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,232
Have you? Have you seen a race that close?

1750
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:38,400
No, Your Highness.

1751
01:26:38,484 --> 01:26:40,861
Mile-and-a-half races are more
commonly won by a boat length or two.

1752
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:43,739
Yes, that's absolutely right. Brutally close.

1753
01:26:43,948 --> 01:26:44,990
May I introduce my teammates?

1754
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:47,034
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us.

1755
01:26:47,118 --> 01:26:48,785
On to the Dutch.

1756
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,665
Sorry you flew all the way out here
to see that.

1757
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:55,918
Wouldn't have missed it, brother.
How was the royalty?

1758
01:26:56,002 --> 01:26:58,629
I just wanted him to tell me
a couple more times how close the race was.

1759
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:02,257
Just brutal, brutally close.
Brutally excruciating. Jesus.

1760
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:04,009
The guy is the prince of a country
the size of Nantucket.

1761
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:05,135
Relax, it's fine.

1762
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:06,428
- Boys. Divya.
- Dad.

1763
01:27:06,512 --> 01:27:08,555
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- That was a tough beat.

1764
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,724
I'm sorry that you and Mom
had to fly out here to see that.

1765
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:12,643
No, don't ever apologize to me
for losing a race like that.

1766
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:15,646
Don't ever apologize to anyone
for losing a race like that.

1767
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:17,606
- Boys.
- Mr. Kenwright.

1768
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:20,943
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright,
head of the host family for this week.

1769
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:22,778
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1770
01:27:22,862 --> 01:27:24,279
I've just had a phone chat with my daughter.

1771
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:27,324
She told me that she and her friends
are already talking about the race,

1772
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:29,701
which they've just seen via their computers.

1773
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:33,664
A new website called Facebook.
Do you have this in America?

1774
01:27:34,999 --> 01:27:37,167
I'm gonna find your mother.

1775
01:27:38,711 --> 01:27:39,753
Have I said something wrong?

1776
01:27:39,837 --> 01:27:41,713
Your daughter doesn't go
to school in the States?

1777
01:27:41,839 --> 01:27:43,131
No, no. Cambridge.

1778
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:45,968
Majoring in French literature, though
I wasn't aware there was such a thing.

1779
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:47,135
And they have Facebook at Cambridge?

1780
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:49,304
And apparently Oxford and
the London School of Economics.

1781
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:50,472
That's where her friends are.

1782
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:52,557
That's awesome.

1783
01:27:53,017 --> 01:27:56,520
Good race, boys.
Take the bitter with the better, eh?

1784
01:27:58,856 --> 01:28:00,232
I'm gonna go watch the race film.

1785
01:28:03,569 --> 01:28:05,862
If this is online, I wanna see it.

1786
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,322
Stop it.

1787
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:09,366
Stop it, Cam.

1788
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:11,243
Knock it off.

1789
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:14,371
I don't mind that we lost
to the Dutch today by less than a second.

1790
01:28:14,497 --> 01:28:16,665
That was a good race,
and that was a fair race.

1791
01:28:16,749 --> 01:28:18,208
And they'll see us again.

1792
01:28:18,334 --> 01:28:20,460
What I mind, and what you should mind,

1793
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:23,714
is showing up on Monday
for a race that was run on Sunday.

1794
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:26,174
We tried talking to him ourselves,
we tried writing a letter,

1795
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:29,845
we tried the Ad Board, and we tried
talking to the president of the university.

1796
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:32,431
Now, I am asking you for the last time,

1797
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:37,728
let's take the considerable resources
at our disposal and sue him in federal court.

1798
01:28:38,187 --> 01:28:39,438
Come on.

1799
01:28:40,857 --> 01:28:42,691
I need a real drink.

1800
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:50,574
Screw it.

1801
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:54,244
Let's gut the friggin' nerd.

1802
01:28:57,081 --> 01:28:58,415
That's what I'm talking about!

1803
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,417
No, no, no, no, no.

1804
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,836
But check it out, I saw him today.

1805
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,339
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham,
my Case Equity guy.

1806
01:29:05,423 --> 01:29:06,506
Hang on.

1807
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:08,258
Are you guys using Spikes
or Ghost Missiles?

1808
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:10,010
We don't know,
we're just shooting at each other.

1809
01:29:10,094 --> 01:29:11,511
Use Sweet Kamikazes.

1810
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:13,722
Like we know what that is.

1811
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:18,018
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera
and he saw me, too.

1812
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:19,686
I know he did.

1813
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:25,067
Don't. Don't sweat it. I'm on a landline.

1814
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:26,568
Bong hit.

1815
01:29:27,278 --> 01:29:28,779
Does anybody hear that banging?

1816
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:31,281
You don't hear anything.
You're writing code.

1817
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:33,367
Dude, somebody's at the door.

1818
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:38,038
It's not a dish best served cold.
It's best served immediately and relentlessly.

1819
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:43,585
I'm gonna call you back.

1820
01:29:45,588 --> 01:29:48,090
What's up?

1821
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,551
Mark was supposed to pick me up
at the airport an hour ago.

1822
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:53,220
I've been calling his cell.

1823
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:57,808
He was on a 36-hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

1824
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:05,148
What happened here?

1825
01:30:05,274 --> 01:30:08,735
Not happened. Happening.
The next big thing.

1826
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:09,986
Wardo.

1827
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,071
Hey, man.

1828
01:30:11,155 --> 01:30:13,156
- Back to work.
- Okay.

1829
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:16,159
The more bad I get at this,
the more wasted I get.

1830
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:17,786
I mean the more wasted that I get...

1831
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:19,579
We understand.

1832
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:23,083
How old are they, Sean?

1833
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,001
It's not polite to ask.

1834
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:26,253
Sean, how old are they?

1835
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:28,839
You think you know me, right?

1836
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:30,173
I've read enough.

1837
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:32,634
You know how much I've read about you?

1838
01:30:33,177 --> 01:30:34,511
Nothing.

1839
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:40,100
- Wardo.
- Hey, man.

1840
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:43,103
- I waited an hour for you at the airport.
- What time is it?

1841
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:46,523
It's midnight. Or 3:00 a.m. In New York,
where I just came from.

1842
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:50,277
You gotta see some of the new stuff we got.
Hey, Dustin. Show him the Wall.

1843
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:51,445
I'm just calling it the Wall.

1844
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:54,114
Forget the Wall, tell him about
the meeting I've got set up.

1845
01:30:54,198 --> 01:30:55,782
You know Peter Thiel?

1846
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:57,200
- Nope.
- No reason you should.

1847
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:00,537
He just runs a $2-billion hedge fund
called Clarium Capital.

1848
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:03,623
Why's he setting up meetings?

1849
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:04,791
Thiel might wanna make
an angel investment.

1850
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:07,961
I don't care if he's an actual angel.
Why is he setting up business meetings?

1851
01:31:08,045 --> 01:31:10,714
- You've had a long flight.
- No, I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK,

1852
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:13,049
then a long wait at the passenger
loading and unloading zone at SFO,

1853
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:15,051
and in between there was a long flight.

1854
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:16,887
I'm the business end of this company.

1855
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:20,056
And he is a houseguest living here rent free

1856
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:23,059
on a very generous grant
from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

1857
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:26,480
I heard about your big-ticket ad buys.
Gary's Tuxedos.

1858
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:28,231
- Hey, man...
- Harvard Bartending Course.

1859
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:31,526
You're just a small step away
from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.

1860
01:31:40,703 --> 01:31:42,996
- You wanna talk to me alone for a minute?
- Sure.

1861
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:48,668
Bong hit.

1862
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:51,046
- I'm so high.
- No, you're not.

1863
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:53,340
So how's it going?

1864
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:56,343
How's the internship? How's Christy?

1865
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:59,679
- How's the internship?
- Yeah.

1866
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:03,183
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.

1867
01:32:03,267 --> 01:32:05,769
We talked about this on the phone.
I quit on my first day.

1868
01:32:07,396 --> 01:32:09,773
I do remember you saying that.

1869
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,733
So how is Christy?

1870
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:13,777
Christy's crazy.

1871
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:15,779
- Is that fun?
- No.

1872
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:16,863
I mean, she's actually psychotic.

1873
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:22,118
She's insanely jealous, she's irrational,
and I'm frightened of her.

1874
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:24,079
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.

1875
01:32:27,625 --> 01:32:31,711
I do not want that guy representing
himself as part of this company.

1876
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,964
You gotta move out here, Wardo,
this is where it's all happening.

1877
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:36,049
- Did you hear what I just said?
- The connections, the energy...

1878
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:37,133
Mark, you got...

1879
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,803
I'm afraid if you don't come out here,
you're gonna get left behind.

1880
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:42,222
I want... I need you out here.

1881
01:32:42,306 --> 01:32:44,224
- Please don't tell him I said that.
- What did you just say?

1882
01:32:44,308 --> 01:32:46,393
It's moving faster than any of us
ever imagined it would.

1883
01:32:46,477 --> 01:32:48,228
- It's moving fast.
- What did you mean?

1884
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:50,230
- And Sean thinks we have...
- Sean is not part of this company.

1885
01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:51,398
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo,

1886
01:32:51,482 --> 01:32:53,650
and we're in 160 schools,
including five in Europe.

1887
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:55,235
I'm aware of that! Mark, I am the CFO!

1888
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:56,736
We need more servers
than I ever expected we'd need.

1889
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:58,405
We need more programmers
and we need more money,

1890
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:00,991
and he set up the Thiel meeting.
He set up meetings all over town.

1891
01:33:01,117 --> 01:33:02,325
- He set up other meetings?
- Yes.

1892
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,160
- Without me knowing anything about it.
- You're in New York.

1893
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:08,164
I'm in New York riding subways
14 hours a day, trying to find advertisers!

1894
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:09,958
And how's it going so far?

1895
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,923
What did you mean, "get left behind"?

1896
01:33:21,637 --> 01:33:23,013
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

1897
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:24,598
I'd like to freeze this bank account

1898
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:28,143
and cancel all existing checks
and lines of credit.

1899
01:33:29,478 --> 01:33:32,647
- May I see some ID, please?
- Yeah, sure, sorry.

1900
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:40,697
Sean, he'll be right with you.

1901
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:42,198
No problem.

1902
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:46,286
You know this is where
they filmed Towering Inferno?

1903
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:48,121
That's comforting.

1904
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:51,291
Hey, guys. Come on back.

1905
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:55,045
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah. We're cool.

1906
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:57,881
Sean, how are you? Come on in.

1907
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:59,883
- You must be Mark.
- Hi.

1908
01:34:01,677 --> 01:34:05,013
We took a look at everything,
and congratulations.

1909
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:08,642
We're gonna start you off
with a $500,000 investment.

1910
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:12,729
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.

1911
01:34:12,855 --> 01:34:14,898
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware

1912
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:17,901
and come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.

1913
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:20,320
Now, let me ask you something.

1914
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:22,405
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

1915
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,010
Jesus Christ.

1916
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:48,682
When did you get back?

1917
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:50,183
You scared me. I need you to knock.

1918
01:34:50,267 --> 01:34:52,185
When did you get back?

1919
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:54,938
I got back this afternoon.

1920
01:34:55,064 --> 01:34:56,523
And when were you gonna call me?

1921
01:34:56,607 --> 01:34:59,275
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip
and I was tired...

1922
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:03,279
Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts.
Did you know I sent 47 texts?

1923
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:07,242
I did, and I thought that was
incredibly normal behavior.

1924
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:08,868
Are you mocking me?

1925
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:10,286
I brought you a present.

1926
01:35:12,123 --> 01:35:14,958
Why does your Status say "single"
on your Facebook page?

1927
01:35:15,084 --> 01:35:16,126
What?

1928
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:20,130
Why does your Relationship Status
say "single" on your Facebook page?

1929
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:21,881
Well, I was single when I set up the page.

1930
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:24,050
And you just never bothered to change it?

1931
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:25,218
What?

1932
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:26,886
I don't know how.

1933
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:28,805
Do I look stupid to you?

1934
01:35:28,931 --> 01:35:30,223
No, calm down.

1935
01:35:30,307 --> 01:35:32,559
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook

1936
01:35:32,643 --> 01:35:34,894
doesn't know how to change
his Relationship Status on Facebook?

1937
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:38,314
It's embarrassing, so you should take it
as a sign of trust that I would tell you that.

1938
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:39,649
- Go to hell.
- Take it easy.

1939
01:35:39,775 --> 01:35:42,819
No, you didn't change it so you could
screw those Silicon Valley sluts

1940
01:35:42,903 --> 01:35:44,070
every time you go out to see Mark.

1941
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:47,157
Not even remotely true, and I can
promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts

1942
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:50,160
don't care what anyone's
Relationship Status is on Facebook.

1943
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:51,661
Please, open your present.

1944
01:35:51,787 --> 01:35:53,663
Your phone does work.

1945
01:35:54,623 --> 01:35:55,749
It's Mark.

1946
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:58,001
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.

1947
01:35:58,085 --> 01:36:00,587
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

1948
01:36:00,671 --> 01:36:02,338
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

1949
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:04,591
This'll be your first.

1950
01:36:04,675 --> 01:36:05,759
Yeah.

1951
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:07,093
<i>- You froze our account?
- I did.</i>

1952
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:09,429
- You froze the account.
- I had to get your attention, Mark.

1953
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:11,264
Do you realize that you jeopardized
the entire company?

1954
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:12,932
Do you realize that your actions
could have destroyed

1955
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,017
everything I've been working on?

1956
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:15,185
We have been working on.

1957
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:16,770
Without money, the site can't function.

1958
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:19,105
Let me tell you the difference
between Facebook and everybody else.

1959
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:20,273
We don't crash ever!

1960
01:36:20,357 --> 01:36:24,027
If the servers are down for even a day, our
entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed.

1961
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:26,112
<i>- Look...
- Users are fickle. Friendster has proved that.</i>

1962
01:36:26,197 --> 01:36:28,948
<i>Even a few people leaving would reverberate
through the entire user base.</i>

1963
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:31,367
The users are interconnected.
That is the whole point.

1964
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:33,203
College kids are online
because their friends are online

1965
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:35,455
and if one domino goes,
the other dominos go.

1966
01:36:35,539 --> 01:36:36,623
Don't you get that?

1967
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:38,333
I am not going back to
the Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!

1968
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:41,711
Holy shit.

1969
01:36:44,548 --> 01:36:45,882
What is wrong with you?

1970
01:36:46,008 --> 01:36:47,467
Did you like being nobody?

1971
01:36:47,551 --> 01:36:49,302
Did you like being a joke?
Do you wanna go back to that?

1972
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:50,804
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

1973
01:36:50,888 --> 01:36:52,222
<i>That was the act of a child,
not a businessman,</i>

1974
01:36:52,306 --> 01:36:53,723
<i>and it certainly was not the act of a friend.</i>

1975
01:36:53,849 --> 01:36:56,392
You know how embarrassing it was for me
to try to cash a check today?

1976
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:57,727
I am not going back to that life.

1977
01:36:57,853 --> 01:37:00,230
<i>- Maybe you were frustrated.
- Yeah!</i>

1978
01:37:00,397 --> 01:37:02,690
- Maybe you were angry.
- I was!

1979
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,235
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,

1980
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:07,654
<i>because, Wardo, I've got some good news.</i>

1981
01:37:07,738 --> 01:37:08,905
I'm sorry.

1982
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:13,743
I was angry, and maybe it was childish,
but I had to get your attention.

1983
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:16,663
Wardo, I said I've got some good news.

1984
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,081
What is it?

1985
01:37:18,207 --> 01:37:20,750
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment
of half a million dollars.

1986
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:22,001
What?

1987
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:26,172
<i>Half a million dollars.
And he's setting us up in an office.</i>

1988
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:29,425
They wanna reincorporate the company.
They wanna meet you.

1989
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:31,010
They need your signature
on some documents,

1990
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:33,513
so you gotta get your ass
on the first flight back to San Francisco.

1991
01:37:33,597 --> 01:37:35,181
<i>I need my CFO.</i>

1992
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:41,187
I'm on my way.

1993
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:42,772
- Wardo?
- Yeah?

1994
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,399
We did it.

1995
01:37:47,736 --> 01:37:48,945
Wardo?

1996
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:51,447
You're going back there already?

1997
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:52,699
Yes.

1998
01:37:54,451 --> 01:37:56,619
And also, I'm breaking up with you.

1999
01:38:00,457 --> 01:38:02,250
Somebody stop her!

2000
01:38:04,753 --> 01:38:05,795
Four documents.

2001
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:07,797
The first two are common stock
purchase agreements,

2002
01:38:07,923 --> 01:38:10,967
allowing you to buy stock
in the newly reincorporated Facebook,

2003
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:14,470
as opposed to the old shares,
which are now worthless.

2004
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:15,722
The third is an exchange agreement

2005
01:38:15,806 --> 01:38:18,558
allowing you to exchange
the old shares for new shares,

2006
01:38:18,642 --> 01:38:20,894
and then finally a voter holding agreement.

2007
01:38:20,978 --> 01:38:22,729
How many shares of stock will I own?

2008
01:38:22,813 --> 01:38:25,982
1,328,334.

2009
01:38:26,066 --> 01:38:27,442
Jesus Christ.

2010
01:38:27,526 --> 01:38:30,445
That represents a 34.4% ownership share.

2011
01:38:30,946 --> 01:38:33,281
Why the increase from the original 30%?

2012
01:38:33,365 --> 01:38:36,117
'Cause you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.

2013
01:38:36,827 --> 01:38:39,078
- I love working with business majors.
- I'm telling you.

2014
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:40,204
- Economics.
- Right.

2015
01:38:40,289 --> 01:38:45,209
You should know that Mark has already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

2016
01:38:46,503 --> 01:38:49,756
Well, Mark doesn't care about money
and he needs to be protected.

2017
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,135
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%.

2018
01:38:54,219 --> 01:38:57,055
Sean Parker, 6.47%.

2019
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:00,350
I can live with that.

2020
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:02,268
And Peter Thiel, 7%.

2021
01:39:06,649 --> 01:39:08,942
Would you like to use my pen?

2022
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:12,153
Eduardo? Eduardo?

2023
01:39:13,906 --> 01:39:15,031
Can you please repeat the question?

2024
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:17,325
No, it was an outrageously leading question
the first time around,

2025
01:39:17,409 --> 01:39:18,534
and now you want us to hear it twice?

2026
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:20,495
Yes. Would you read it back, please?

2027
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:21,621
Well, go ahead.

2028
01:39:21,705 --> 01:39:23,414
'And when you signed
these documents,

2029
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:26,250
"'were you aware that you were signing
your own death certificate?"'

2030
01:39:26,335 --> 01:39:27,418
No.

2031
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:35,969
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all the...

2032
01:39:36,053 --> 01:39:39,222
In all honesty,
I thought they were my lawyers.

2033
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:44,060
I was your only friend.

2034
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,313
You had one friend.

2035
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:53,194
My father won't even look at me.

2036
01:39:53,278 --> 01:39:58,366
Okay, Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg say
anything to you after you signed the papers?

2037
01:39:58,492 --> 01:40:01,494
There was a lot of handshaking,
a lot of congratulations.

2038
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:04,038
He'd already told me that he wouldn't be

2039
01:40:04,123 --> 01:40:07,250
coming back to school
for at least a semester,

2040
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:10,086
so we were saying goodbye for a while.

2041
01:40:10,879 --> 01:40:12,130
And then before I left he said...

2042
01:40:12,214 --> 01:40:13,297
But you gotta come back.

2043
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:15,883
Somewhere around the end of November
or early December.

2044
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:18,428
Peter wants to throw us an amazing party
when we hit a million members.

2045
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:20,263
It's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back for it.

2046
01:40:20,347 --> 01:40:21,639
A million members?

2047
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:22,890
Yeah.

2048
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:26,686
Remember the algorithm
on the window at Kirkland?

2049
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:28,813
Yeah.

2050
01:40:32,234 --> 01:40:33,484
Yeah, I'll be here.

2051
01:40:38,657 --> 01:40:39,824
You sure about this?

2052
01:40:39,908 --> 01:40:41,075
You're 20 minutes late.

2053
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,618
You're gonna walk in there
and say you overslept

2054
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:43,828
and didn't have time to get dressed.

2055
01:40:43,912 --> 01:40:46,080
They're gonna pitch you.
Case Equity is going to pitch you.

2056
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:47,749
They're gonna beg you to take their money.

2057
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:49,500
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod,
you're gonna nod,

2058
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:52,628
and then you're gonna say,
"Which one of you is Roth?"

2059
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:54,130
No, not Roth. Manningham.

2060
01:40:54,214 --> 01:40:56,340
"Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?"
And he'll say, "I am."

2061
01:40:56,425 --> 01:40:59,886
And then you say,
"Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you."'

2062
01:41:00,429 --> 01:41:01,763
Walk out.

2063
01:41:01,889 --> 01:41:03,056
Okay.

2064
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:18,029
In late November, I got the e-mail from Mark

2065
01:41:18,113 --> 01:41:20,156
telling me to come out
for the millionth-member party.

2066
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,282
What else did the e-mail say?

2067
01:41:21,867 --> 01:41:24,035
It said that we had to have
a business meeting.

2068
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:28,164
That Mark and Sean had played
some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,

2069
01:41:28,832 --> 01:41:30,458
<i>and that Manningham was so impressed</i>

2070
01:41:30,542 --> 01:41:34,462
<i>that he was now making an investment offer
that was hard to turn down.</i>

2071
01:41:34,546 --> 01:41:38,716
<i>So I went to California,
and I went straight to the new offices.</i>

2072
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:42,512
<i>I didn't know whether to dress for the party
or for the business meeting,</i>

2073
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:44,972
<i>so I kind of dressed for both.</i>

2074
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:47,642
<i>- But it didn't matter.
- Why not?</i>

2075
01:41:47,726 --> 01:41:49,936
<i>Because I wasn't called out there
for either one.</i>

2076
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:51,604
What were you called out there for?

2077
01:41:55,442 --> 01:41:56,818
An ambush.

2078
01:41:57,236 --> 01:41:59,070
Mr. Saverin. Hey. Right over here.

2079
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:07,245
Hey, man.

2080
01:42:07,329 --> 01:42:08,371
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

2081
01:42:08,455 --> 01:42:11,165
- Good, good, good, good, good.
- Good to see you.

2082
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:14,710
At first I thought he was joking.
Giving me more contracts to sign.

2083
01:42:19,091 --> 01:42:20,883
But then I started reading.

2084
01:42:24,263 --> 01:42:26,055
Wait, what is this?

2085
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:29,642
Well, as you know, we had some
new investors that have come in.

2086
01:42:29,768 --> 01:42:30,810
What is this?

2087
01:42:43,115 --> 01:42:44,574
Mr. Saverin.

2088
01:42:47,202 --> 01:42:48,369
Mark!

2089
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:51,122
- Mark?
- He's wired in.

2090
01:42:51,206 --> 01:42:52,248
- Sorry?
- He's wired in.

2091
01:42:52,332 --> 01:42:53,791
- Is he?
- Yes.

2092
01:42:55,377 --> 01:42:58,129
- How about now? Are you still wired in?
- Call security.

2093
01:42:58,213 --> 01:43:00,047
You issued 24 million new shares of stock!

2094
01:43:01,258 --> 01:43:02,884
You were told that if new investors
came along...

2095
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:06,095
How much were your shares diluted?
How much were his?

2096
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:09,932
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?

2097
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:11,309
It wasn't.

2098
01:43:11,393 --> 01:43:15,021
What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share
diluted down to?

2099
01:43:15,105 --> 01:43:16,439
It wasn't.

2100
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:19,442
What was Sean Parker's ownership share
diluted down to?

2101
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:20,568
It wasn't.

2102
01:43:20,652 --> 01:43:23,321
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share
diluted down to?

2103
01:43:23,405 --> 01:43:24,488
It wasn't.

2104
01:43:24,573 --> 01:43:27,575
And what was your ownership share
diluted down to?

2105
01:43:28,577 --> 01:43:31,245
.03%

2106
01:43:39,087 --> 01:43:41,380
- You signed the papers.
- You set me up.

2107
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:44,008
You're gonna blame me because you were
the business head of the company,

2108
01:43:44,092 --> 01:43:45,968
and you made a bad business deal
with your own company?

2109
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:47,678
It's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook.

2110
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:49,096
It won't be like
you're not a part of Facebook.

2111
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:50,223
You're not a part of Facebook.

2112
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:52,683
- My name's on the masthead.
- You might wanna check again.

2113
01:43:52,768 --> 01:43:54,101
This because I froze the account?

2114
01:43:54,186 --> 01:43:56,354
You think we'd let you
parade around in your ridiculous suits,

2115
01:43:56,438 --> 01:43:57,480
pretending you were running this company?

2116
01:43:57,564 --> 01:43:59,899
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's!

2117
01:43:59,983 --> 01:44:04,362
Along with my hoodie and my fuck-you
flip-flops, you pretentious douchebag!

2118
01:44:04,446 --> 01:44:06,113
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.

2119
01:44:06,198 --> 01:44:09,116
- I'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.

2120
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:11,327
Tell me this isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.

2121
01:44:13,997 --> 01:44:18,209
You... You did it. I knew you did it.
You planted that story about the chicken!

2122
01:44:18,293 --> 01:44:20,419
- I didn't plant that story.
- What's he talking about?

2123
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:23,464
- You had me accused of animal cruelty.
- Seriously. What the hell's the chicken?

2124
01:44:23,548 --> 01:44:25,258
And I'll bet what you hated the most

2125
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:28,761
is that they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.

2126
01:44:29,221 --> 01:44:32,056
Which I am. You better lawyer up, asshole.

2127
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:36,686
'Cause I'm not coming back for 30%.
I'm coming back for everything.

2128
01:44:43,151 --> 01:44:46,112
- Get him out of here.
- It's okay, I'm going.

2129
01:44:48,073 --> 01:44:49,365
Hang on.

2130
01:44:51,576 --> 01:44:53,160
Almost forgot.

2131
01:44:54,204 --> 01:44:56,497
Here's your $19,000.
I wouldn't cash it, though.

2132
01:44:56,581 --> 01:44:58,124
I drew it on the account you froze.

2133
01:45:03,422 --> 01:45:05,965
I like standing next to you, Sean.

2134
01:45:07,217 --> 01:45:09,343
It makes me look so tough.

2135
01:45:22,482 --> 01:45:23,774
Well...

2136
01:45:24,234 --> 01:45:27,153
That's it, that's our show for tonight, people.

2137
01:45:27,237 --> 01:45:29,530
And look, I wanna see everyone here
geared up for a party.

2138
01:45:29,614 --> 01:45:31,699
We're gonna walk into that club
like it's the Macy's Parade.

2139
01:45:31,783 --> 01:45:34,910
Mackey, put it up on the big screen.
We've gotta almost be there.

2140
01:45:38,165 --> 01:45:40,041
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2141
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:42,752
You were kind of rough on him.

2142
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:44,837
That's life in the NFL.

2143
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:46,672
You know you didn't have to be
that rough on him.

2144
01:45:46,757 --> 01:45:48,924
- Listen, I put him...
- Sean!

2145
01:45:50,218 --> 01:45:52,303
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2146
01:45:52,387 --> 01:45:53,596
He almost killed it.

2147
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,558
I'll send flowers.

2148
01:45:59,269 --> 01:46:03,981
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together
a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

2149
01:46:04,066 --> 01:46:05,316
Ashleigh's a sister.

2150
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:06,942
- Ashleigh?
- The intern.

2151
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:10,196
Yeah. I know who she is. Are you guys...

2152
01:46:10,822 --> 01:46:12,490
Ashleigh? Me? No.

2153
01:46:12,574 --> 01:46:14,033
Well, a little bit.

2154
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:15,951
Why?

2155
01:46:16,036 --> 01:46:17,870
- No. Nothing, I just...
- Excuse me. Mark?

2156
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:21,207
- We were just talking about you.
- Just that you're doing a really good job.

2157
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:24,043
Thanks. I appreciate that.

2158
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:26,128
These came in for you.

2159
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:28,005
Put them on my desk.

2160
01:46:34,971 --> 01:46:36,389
What's the package?

2161
01:46:37,265 --> 01:46:38,307
Nothing.

2162
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:42,228
- Mackey.
- Yes, sir.

2163
01:46:42,312 --> 01:46:43,604
Refresh.

2164
01:46:44,106 --> 01:46:45,314
Sweet!

2165
01:46:51,321 --> 01:46:53,364
And you're not a hugger.

2166
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:54,949
I know.

2167
01:46:57,577 --> 01:46:59,036
One million!

2168
01:47:00,622 --> 01:47:03,374
Who's got champagne? Huh?

2169
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:06,502
I've got champagne.

2170
01:47:26,356 --> 01:47:29,942
The next transformative development,
a picture-sharing application.

2171
01:47:30,026 --> 01:47:33,112
A place where you view pictures
that coincide with your social life.

2172
01:47:33,196 --> 01:47:36,198
It is the true digitalization of real life.

2173
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:38,742
- You can use a CD.
- You can do it off of me.

2174
01:47:38,827 --> 01:47:40,536
You don't just go to a party anymore.

2175
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:44,373
You go to a party with a digital camera,
and then your friends relive the party online.

2176
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:45,833
And tagging. The idea...

2177
01:47:45,917 --> 01:47:49,128
- Would this be easier without the bra?
- It's worth finding out.

2178
01:47:56,887 --> 01:47:59,263
All right, shut the music down!

2179
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:01,265
The party's over!

2180
01:48:01,349 --> 01:48:03,142
Everybody, go home!

2181
01:48:03,643 --> 01:48:06,103
I've spent hours watching
what people do when they log on.

2182
01:48:06,188 --> 01:48:07,563
How they check their friends' status updates.

2183
01:48:07,647 --> 01:48:09,148
Wait. That's weird. Why did the music stop?

2184
01:48:09,232 --> 01:48:10,399
Check to see which one of their friends

2185
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:12,401
changed their profiles,
changed their photos...

2186
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:14,069
Seriously, what happened to the music?

2187
01:48:14,154 --> 01:48:16,113
We lived on farms
and then we lived in cities,

2188
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:18,157
and now we're going to live on the Internet!

2189
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:21,911
Sean, stop.
I think something's going on downstairs.

2190
01:48:30,962 --> 01:48:33,756
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

2191
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:37,092
It's time for you to go home.
The party is over.

2192
01:48:37,427 --> 01:48:39,261
Then it's all good.

2193
01:48:41,014 --> 01:48:42,097
- It's the cops.
- What?

2194
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:43,224
Shit! Shit.

2195
01:48:43,308 --> 01:48:47,061
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Okay, it's okay. Be cool.

2196
01:48:47,604 --> 01:48:49,772
Good to see you, Officer.
What can I do for you?

2197
01:48:50,982 --> 01:48:52,024
What's going on?

2198
01:48:52,108 --> 01:48:54,693
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.

2199
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:56,320
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

2200
01:48:56,404 --> 01:48:59,198
I can tell them to turn the music down.

2201
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:04,161
That's not mine.

2202
01:49:04,579 --> 01:49:07,581
Okay, we're gonna need identification.
Keep your hands where we can see them.

2203
01:49:07,666 --> 01:49:09,083
Oh, my God.

2204
01:49:09,167 --> 01:49:10,876
You got anything else in your pockets
I should know about?

2205
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:12,002
No, sir. No.

2206
01:49:12,087 --> 01:49:14,338
- Don't be stupid, now.
- I don't, I don't.

2207
01:49:19,427 --> 01:49:20,928
What's this?

2208
01:49:21,137 --> 01:49:22,846
That's an EpiPen.

2209
01:49:23,932 --> 01:49:26,267
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.

2210
01:49:27,102 --> 01:49:28,769
How old are you?

2211
01:49:29,354 --> 01:49:32,273
Twenty-one.

2212
01:49:32,357 --> 01:49:33,774
- Twenty-one.
- I'm 21.

2213
01:49:33,858 --> 01:49:35,526
Lying only makes it worse.

2214
01:49:36,903 --> 01:49:39,405
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

2215
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:51,458
Hello.

2216
01:49:51,543 --> 01:49:54,044
Listen, something's happened.

2217
01:50:01,344 --> 01:50:02,386
Shit.

2218
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:04,388
No, it's all right. It's gonna be all right.

2219
01:50:04,472 --> 01:50:08,475
I posted bond, and I wasn't doing anything.
I mean, I've got allergies.

2220
01:50:13,273 --> 01:50:14,315
Interns.

2221
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:16,233
It was just a party.

2222
01:50:19,029 --> 01:50:22,406
This is gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online any second.

2223
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:24,658
I know.

2224
01:50:24,743 --> 01:50:26,410
You know with an intern...

2225
01:50:26,494 --> 01:50:28,662
No, it's cool. I have it under control.

2226
01:50:28,747 --> 01:50:30,331
I will get it under control.

2227
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:32,791
I will call someone
and see what the next move is.

2228
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:34,418
But this is gonna be news now.

2229
01:50:35,170 --> 01:50:37,671
You don't think Wardo
was involved, do you?

2230
01:50:37,756 --> 01:50:38,797
I mean, do you think...

2231
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:39,965
No.

2232
01:50:40,175 --> 01:50:42,051
Or Manningham. One of them.

2233
01:50:42,135 --> 01:50:45,387
Somebody. Somebody sent the coke
in there, because it got in there.

2234
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,306
You believe me. God, this is gonna be fine.

2235
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:53,354
Right?

2236
01:50:56,107 --> 01:50:57,691
Go home, Sean.

2237
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:14,124
<i>Mark?</i>

2238
01:51:16,002 --> 01:51:17,086
<i>Mark.</i>

2239
01:51:19,589 --> 01:51:21,256
We're done for the day.

2240
01:51:21,341 --> 01:51:23,926
Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here.

2241
01:51:27,597 --> 01:51:29,515
What happened to Sean?

2242
01:51:29,849 --> 01:51:32,267
He still owns 7% of the company.

2243
01:51:36,439 --> 01:51:40,693
All you had all day was that salad.
Do you wanna get something to eat?

2244
01:51:40,777 --> 01:51:42,111
I can't.

2245
01:51:49,786 --> 01:51:51,036
I'm not a bad guy.

2246
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:52,621
I know that.

2247
01:51:52,997 --> 01:51:56,500
When there's emotional testimony,
I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.

2248
01:51:56,626 --> 01:51:58,085
And the other 15?

2249
01:51:58,169 --> 01:52:01,296
Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.

2250
01:52:04,968 --> 01:52:06,301
What happens now?

2251
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:11,682
Sy and the others are having a steak
on University Avenue.

2252
01:52:12,183 --> 01:52:13,642
Then they'll come back up to the office,

2253
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:17,020
and start working on a settlement
agreement to present to you.

2254
01:52:17,147 --> 01:52:19,022
- They're gonna settle?
- Oh, yeah.

2255
01:52:19,649 --> 01:52:22,484
- And you're gonna have to pay a little extra.
- Why?

2256
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:24,737
So that these guys sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

2257
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:27,823
They say one unflattering word about you
in public, you own their wife and kids.

2258
01:52:27,907 --> 01:52:29,116
I invented Facebook.

2259
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:31,326
I'm talking about a jury.

2260
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:34,163
I specialize in voir dire, jury selection.

2261
01:52:34,247 --> 01:52:36,623
What a jury sees
when they look at a defendant.

2262
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:39,084
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likeability...

2263
01:52:39,169 --> 01:52:40,377
Likeability.

2264
01:52:40,503 --> 01:52:43,338
I've been licensed to practice law
for all of 20 months,

2265
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:44,798
and I could get a jury to believe

2266
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:47,593
that you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.

2267
01:52:47,677 --> 01:52:48,761
Watch what else.

2268
01:52:49,262 --> 01:52:51,346
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party
that night?

2269
01:52:52,098 --> 01:52:54,308
- You think I'm the one that called the police?
- Doesn't matter.

2270
01:52:54,392 --> 01:52:56,477
I asked the question,
now everybody's thinking about it.

2271
01:52:56,561 --> 01:52:58,687
You've lost yourjury in the first 10 minutes.

2272
01:53:00,356 --> 01:53:01,482
Farm animals.

2273
01:53:01,566 --> 01:53:02,733
Yeah.

2274
01:53:03,735 --> 01:53:06,278
I was drunk and angry and stupid.

2275
01:53:06,362 --> 01:53:08,614
- And blogging.
- And blogging.

2276
01:53:09,741 --> 01:53:11,074
Pay them.

2277
01:53:11,367 --> 01:53:12,576
In the scheme of things,

2278
01:53:13,036 --> 01:53:14,369
it's a speeding ticket.

2279
01:53:16,372 --> 01:53:18,749
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

2280
01:53:18,875 --> 01:53:21,752
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed
and used the computer for a minute?

2281
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:23,378
I can't imagine it would be a problem.

2282
01:53:23,463 --> 01:53:24,713
Thanks.

2283
01:53:25,548 --> 01:53:27,883
I appreciate your help today.

2284
01:53:31,721 --> 01:53:33,972
You're not an asshole, Mark.

2285
01:53:35,225 --> 01:53:37,726
You're just trying so hard to be.
