1
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:26,510
Where are they?

2
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:27,610
I don't know.

3
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:29,120
Dad!

4
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:31,180
Uncle Merrill!

5
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:33,920
Dad!

6
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:39,421
Morgan!

7
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:52,811
Bo? Bo?

8
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,006
Bo, where's Morgan?

9
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,070
Bo?

10
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:58,276
Are you in my dream,
too?

11
00:03:58,351 --> 00:04:00,717
- This is not a dr...
- Dad!

12
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,118
Hey...

13
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:03,746
Honey...

14
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:10,460
Morgan?
What's happening?

15
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,328
The dogs were barking...
woke us up.

16
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:17,365
Are you hurt?

17
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:20,634
I think God did it.

18
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:22,971
Did what, Morgan?

19
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:44,256
Look, Lee, I don't even care
if it was him.

20
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:46,884
And you can just have
a word with him,

21
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,951
and that'd be enough for me.

22
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:52,988
See, it was strange
finding the crops that way.

23
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,432
The kids were confused by it,

24
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:57,800
and, uh, it'd sure take
the strangeness away

25
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:01,568
if I knew it was just
Lionel and the Wolfington
brothers messing around,

26
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,835
that's all.

27
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,505
At the movies?

28
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:09,275
Are you sure?

29
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:11,146
All right, then.

30
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:13,185
Uh, thanks for
your patience, Lee.

31
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:14,777
Yeah. Bye.

32
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:23,390
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.

33
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:26,398
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.

34
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,127
He doesn't treat animals.

35
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:30,226
Well, he'll know
what to do.

36
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:48,111
Oh. That was quick,
Caroline.

37
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:50,156
I only called you folks
two hours ago.

38
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:52,783
Old Mrs. Kendleman
twisted her ankle,

39
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:55,350
as she puts it,
diving for her life

40
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:59,728
when a bunch of school kids
rode down the sidewalk
on skateboards.

41
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:02,825
She went down to Thornton's
store this morning

42
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:06,201
and started spitting
on the new skateboards.

43
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:07,830
Spitting!

44
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:09,397
By the time I got there,

45
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:12,536
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed
the whole damned place.

46
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:15,274
And she must have had
a cold or something.

47
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:19,011
I'm telling you,
I won't eat for a week.

48
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:24,787
So, what happened
to your crops?

49
00:07:28,294 --> 00:07:31,229
Dad's gonna burn these
again.

50
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:41,440
It's contaminated.

51
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:43,805
You don't even know
what that word means.

52
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:47,974
It's not contaminated.

53
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:51,073
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.

54
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,515
It tastes funny.

55
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:53,813
It does not.

56
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:55,854
And besides, he licks
his butt every day.

57
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:57,583
I don't think he'll mind.

58
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,904
Houdini?

59
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:19,501
Bo, don't run.

60
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:20,876
What's wrong, boy?

61
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:23,743
Stop it, Houdini.

62
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:34,385
Look at where
it's bent over, Father.

63
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,395
It's not broken.

64
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:42,594
Now, what kind of machine
can bend a stalk of corn
over without breaking it?

65
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:45,569
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.

66
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:48,630
It doesn't sound much
like Lionel Prichard and
the Wolfington brothers.

67
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,266
They can't take a piss

68
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:53,335
without wetting
the front of their pants.

69
00:08:53,412 --> 00:08:56,711
I don't think anyone
else around here has
had any problems.

70
00:08:56,782 --> 00:08:59,717
I was over at Theo Henry's
farm yesterday afternoon,

71
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:01,912
and he would have
mentioned something.

72
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:04,548
Why were you at Theo's place?

73
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:08,082
Some animals around the county
have been acting funny...

74
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:11,562
and some of them violent.

75
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:13,599
What is it, a virus?

76
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,362
I don't think so, Father.

77
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:19,768
They're more edgy,
you know, and alert.

78
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,206
It's almost like they
act when they smell
a predator around...

79
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,710
peeing on themselves
and everything.

80
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,954
Caroline...

81
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:41,357
please stop calling me
"Father."

82
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,691
What's wrong?

83
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:46,857
I don't hear my children.

84
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:17,328
He fell on me.

85
00:10:17,396 --> 00:10:20,160
He wanted to kill Bo.

86
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:38,243
Did he hurt you?

87
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:40,251
No.

88
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:47,415
I'm so sorry, Morgan.

89
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,544
Where were you?

90
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:12,049
Houdini's sick.

91
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:14,586
Tie Isabel up to the
back of the shed, please,

92
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:17,020
and make sure
the knot's very tight.

93
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,491
What's the matter?

94
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:05,799
There's a monster
outside my room.

95
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:08,738
Can I have a glass of water?

96
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:12,243
What's wrong with the water
next to your bed?

97
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:15,280
It tastes old.

98
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:50,047
What are you thinking about?

99
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:57,213
Why do you talk to Mom
when you're by yourself?

100
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:01,922
Makes me feel better.

101
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:05,430
Does she ever answer back?

102
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:11,730
No.

103
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:17,736
She never answers me either.

104
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:34,759
What?

105
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:39,355
Lionel Prichard and the
Wolfington brothers are back.

106
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:41,296
It's time
for an ass-whupping.

107
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:44,495
This is not an intelligent
way to approach this.

108
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,130
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.

109
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:49,037
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee
a favor.

110
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,235
All right, listen...
we both go outside,

111
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,710
move around the house
in opposite directions.

112
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,679
We act crazy,
insane with anger...

113
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,443
make them crap in their pants,

114
00:13:57,516 --> 00:14:01,145
force them around till
we meet up on the other side.

115
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,482
Explain "act crazy."

116
00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:04,146
You know, curse and stuff.

117
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:05,554
You want me to curse?

118
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:08,058
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.

119
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,094
What?

120
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:10,719
Well, it won't be convincing.

121
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:12,730
It doesn't sound natural
when I curse.

122
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:15,767
Just make noises, then.

123
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,028
Explain "noises."

124
00:14:17,102 --> 00:14:19,502
Are you gonna do this or what?

125
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:20,799
No, I'm not.

126
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:23,933
All right, you want
them stealing something
in the house next time?

127
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:25,772
On the count of three...

128
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:27,368
- 1...
- All right.

129
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:28,845
2... 3!

130
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:33,874
Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!

131
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:36,216
We're gonna beat
your ass, bitch!

132
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:43,620
We're gonna tear
your head off!

133
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:45,561
I'm losing my mind!

134
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:49,593
It's time for
an ass-whupping!

135
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:56,738
I cursed.

136
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,004
I heard.

137
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,774
How did he get...

138
00:15:19,631 --> 00:15:22,293
Are you sure
this is Lionel Prichard?

139
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:42,384
You like that?

140
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:48,591
You got an old
baby monitor around?

141
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,560
Bo had an old baby monitor.

142
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:53,530
You can use Bo's baby monitor
as a walkie-talkie.

143
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,396
- You can?
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:58,129
It only works one way,
but that'll do fine.

145
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:04,098
That is, until someone gets
you an old walkie-talkie
left over at the station.

146
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:06,007
Stop! It's hideous!

147
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:07,375
Get it off!

148
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:08,606
I-I know what to do.

149
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:11,482
Hey, Bo...

150
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,848
turn that down till
Officer Paski leaves.

151
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,079
Doy-da!

152
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,755
You're too old
to still be doing this.

153
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:21,986
You take a glass of water,
and you finish it.

154
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,051
Now, what's wrong
with this one?

155
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:26,188
It has dust in it.

156
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:27,698
This one?

157
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:29,290
A hair.

158
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:30,801
This one?

159
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:34,236
Morgan took a sip, and
it has his amebas in it.

160
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:36,672
My turn.

161
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,540
So, how are you, Merrill?

162
00:16:42,614 --> 00:16:45,082
Fine.

163
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,449
How is work at
the gas station?

164
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,385
Stimulating.

165
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,894
I never got a chance
to tell you,

166
00:16:56,962 --> 00:17:00,557
but I-I thought your
moving in here with
your brother after...

167
00:17:00,632 --> 00:17:03,157
it was a nice thing to do.

168
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:06,363
Well, I don't think
I'm helping much.

169
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:11,976
You are.

170
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:32,562
Sorry.

171
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:36,829
Okay, so far I have,
"It was very dark."

172
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:39,496
Yes, it was.

173
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:43,598
You can't describe him
at all?

174
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:46,109
Don't you think
that's kind of odd?

175
00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:48,942
A little.

176
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:53,246
I don't know whether to look
for a giant or a midget.

177
00:17:53,318 --> 00:17:55,343
No, he definitely
wasn't a midget.

178
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,217
Okay.

179
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:59,655
So he was tall?

180
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:04,588
I-I would say so, yes.

181
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:06,290
Probably.

182
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:08,595
Over 6 feet?

183
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:12,260
It was very dark.

184
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:14,100
Yes, it was.

185
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:17,369
How certain are you
that this was a male?

186
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:20,275
Oh, I don't know...
I don't know any girls
who could run like that.

187
00:18:20,345 --> 00:18:21,710
I don't know, Merrill.

188
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,510
I've seen some of those women
on the Olympics.

189
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,608
They can run like the wind.

190
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:29,245
This guy got on our roof
in, like, a second.

191
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,619
O-Our roof is 10 feet high.

192
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,523
They have women's high jumping
in the Olympics.

193
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:36,686
They got these
Scandinavian women

194
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:39,060
who can jump clean over me.

195
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:45,369
Caroline, I know you're
making a point here,

196
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:47,405
but I just don't know
what it is.

197
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:50,669
An out-of-town woman stopped by
the diner yesterday afternoon

198
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:52,505
and started yelling
and cussing

199
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:55,172
because they didn't have
her favorite cigarettes

200
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:57,511
at the vending machine.

201
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:01,952
She scared a couple
of the customers.

202
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,547
No one's seen her since.

203
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:06,784
And my point is,

204
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:10,191
we don't know anything
about the person you saw,

205
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:14,164
and we should just keep
all possibilities available.

206
00:19:16,468 --> 00:19:18,197
Dad, where's the remote?

207
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,703
I don't know, baby.

208
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:22,831
Why don't you check
in the sofa cushions?

209
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:24,466
Excluding the possibility

210
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,909
that a female Scandinavian
Olympian

211
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:30,005
was running around outside
our house last night,

212
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:32,346
what else might be
a possibility?

213
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:34,578
I'm not done asking
questions,

214
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:37,178
and I don't appreciate
sarcasm.

215
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:40,690
Do you two have anyone

216
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:43,887
who might have a grudge
or something against you...

217
00:19:43,962 --> 00:19:45,953
maybe a-a church member

218
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:48,124
who... who might
not have liked

219
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,634
the fact that
you left the church?

220
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:55,205
I don't think so.

221
00:19:55,273 --> 00:19:56,501
Okay, I was out of line

222
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:59,237
with the whole female-
Scandinavian-Olympian thing.

223
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:02,644
It's just,
I'm pretty strong,

224
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:05,012
and I'm pretty fast.

225
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,608
And I was running
as fast as I could,

226
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:12,885
and this guy, he was...
he was just toying with us.

227
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,324
There's only food
under the sofa.

228
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:16,725
Baby, why don't you

229
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:19,355
just change the channel
on the television?

230
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:20,796
I did.

231
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:21,992
And?

232
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:26,003
Same show's on every station.

233
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:29,837
Every station?

234
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:38,573
Bo, turn up the volume.

235
00:20:38,649 --> 00:20:41,083
Crop signs first emerged
in the late '70s

236
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:43,916
with renewed interest
in extraterrestrial life.

237
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:46,752
They died out
by the early '80s,

238
00:20:46,824 --> 00:20:48,724
dismissed as hoaxes.

239
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:52,593
This new resurgence
is wholly different.

240
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:55,291
The speed and the quantity
in which it has appeared

241
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:58,494
implies the coordination
of hundreds of individuals

242
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:00,332
over many countries.

243
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:07,439
There are only a limited
number of explanations.

244
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:12,107
Either this is one
of the most elaborate
hoaxes ever created,

245
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:15,550
or basically...

246
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:18,315
it's for real.

247
00:21:23,928 --> 00:21:27,364
Extraterrestrials.

248
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:32,198
What in God's name
is going on?

249
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:35,761
I did some research
after I saw your crops.

250
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,936
Two or three guys can make
a design the size of the
one in your field overnight

251
00:21:40,011 --> 00:21:41,911
using just boards and ropes.

252
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:43,241
Really?

253
00:21:43,314 --> 00:21:47,011
That's how these things
have been done in the past.

254
00:21:47,084 --> 00:21:49,917
But there are so many now.

255
00:21:49,987 --> 00:21:53,787
How could so many people
be in on it?

256
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,186
I can't think straight.

257
00:21:57,261 --> 00:21:59,229
I'm... I'm gonna go back
to the station

258
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:02,424
and have a cup of
Edgar's coffee and...
and try to think clear.

259
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,831
And after that, I'll...

260
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:06,335
I might make some calls.

261
00:22:06,404 --> 00:22:09,840
But I'll tell you
something... what I said
in there, it still goes.

262
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:12,398
Your... your family
has been through a lot.

263
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:15,070
And the last thing
these children need to do

264
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:18,741
is worry about some crazy
things happening in the world.

265
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:20,408
Now, take them into town

266
00:22:20,484 --> 00:22:24,443
and get their minds
and your mind on
everyday things, hmm?

267
00:22:24,522 --> 00:22:26,251
Good medicine.

268
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:29,383
That's good advice.

269
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:35,194
And you take care
of yourself...

270
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:38,064
Graham.

271
00:22:47,178 --> 00:22:50,579
The footage you're watching
was shot yesterday afternoon

272
00:22:50,648 --> 00:22:53,208
by a 34-year-old local
cameraman in Bangalore,

273
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,514
a southern city of India.

274
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:58,111
It's the 18th reported
crop sign

275
00:22:58,189 --> 00:23:01,420
found in that country
in the last 72 hours.

276
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:06,457
Uncle Merrill, will you
turn on the radio?

277
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:11,857
They are signs intended
to be seen from the sky...

278
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:18,097
No radio either.
Just for a while.

279
00:23:45,202 --> 00:23:47,534
Book money?

280
00:23:47,605 --> 00:23:49,266
Sure.

281
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,109
Just one.

282
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:05,312
Be back for pizza in 15.

283
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:12,225
It's just a bunch of crock.

284
00:24:12,296 --> 00:24:16,027
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.

285
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,295
Been watching these reports
since morning.

286
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:20,929
I have seen 12 soda
commercials so far...

287
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:22,666
12!

288
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,005
You have any books
on extraterrestrials?

289
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:28,704
Now, don't tell me you believe
this horse manure.

290
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:31,009
As a matter of fact,
I think we have one.

291
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:32,912
Came by mistake
in a shipment...

292
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:35,144
decided to keep it
for the city people.

293
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:39,246
Last row, third book
on the left, honey.

294
00:24:39,323 --> 00:24:41,723
Why is no one saying
the obvious?

295
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:44,022
These are just copycats.

296
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:47,063
Someone somewhere does
the first one...

297
00:24:47,131 --> 00:24:50,225
It was asthma medicine,
right, Father?

298
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:51,893
For Morgan Hess.

299
00:24:51,969 --> 00:24:54,335
And it's not "Father"
anymore.

300
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:57,772
In less than an hour,
a couple hundred people
get the same brilliant idea,

301
00:24:57,841 --> 00:25:03,336
and here we are, on
the verge of mass hysteria.

302
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:10,245
Can I ask you a favor,
Father?

303
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:12,812
I need to clear
my conscience.

304
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,051
Will you listen to me?

305
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:19,926
Tracey... I am not
a reverend anymore.

306
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:22,727
I haven't been
for six months.

307
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,927
You know this.

308
00:25:25,002 --> 00:25:27,470
All this stuff on TV...

309
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:30,439
two girls came in here
talking about the end
of the world...

310
00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:33,738
I'm just a little scared.

311
00:25:33,811 --> 00:25:38,111
Please, I need to clear
my conscience.

312
00:25:44,955 --> 00:25:47,651
I've got it figured.

313
00:25:50,994 --> 00:25:52,018
You do?

314
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:53,893
I've had two separate
folks tell me

315
00:25:53,964 --> 00:25:57,195
there have been strangers
around these parts
last couple nights.

316
00:25:57,267 --> 00:25:59,497
Can't tell what they look like

317
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,097
'cause they're staying
in the shadows... covert like.

318
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:05,164
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.

319
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:07,335
And that's the giveaway.

320
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:08,878
I see.

321
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:10,777
It's called "probing."

322
00:26:10,848 --> 00:26:12,941
It's a military procedure.

323
00:26:13,016 --> 00:26:14,916
You send out a
reconnaissance group...

324
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:17,351
very small...
to check things out.

325
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:21,619
Not to engage but
to evaluate the situation...

326
00:26:21,692 --> 00:26:24,559
evaluate the level of danger,

327
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:27,688
make sure things
are all clear.

328
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:30,893
Clear for what?

329
00:26:30,968 --> 00:26:33,869
For the rest of them.

330
00:26:37,374 --> 00:26:39,103
Yeah?

331
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:42,145
You got a pamphlet or
something I can read?

332
00:26:42,212 --> 00:26:45,113
Sure.

333
00:26:45,182 --> 00:26:47,343
Thanks.

334
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:51,786
You didn't used to play
baseball, did ya?

335
00:26:51,855 --> 00:26:54,483
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.

336
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:57,527
I was there the day
you hit that 507-footer

337
00:26:57,594 --> 00:27:00,461
over the left-field wall...
set the record.

338
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:03,056
Man, that thing had
a motor on it.

339
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:05,328
It's still the record, right?

340
00:27:05,402 --> 00:27:09,805
Got the bat at home
o-on the wall.

341
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:12,740
You've got two minor-league
home-run records, don't ya?

342
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,210
Five.

343
00:27:15,312 --> 00:27:17,678
Why weren't you in the pros
making stacks of cash

344
00:27:17,748 --> 00:27:20,080
and getting your toes licked
by beautiful women?

345
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:23,779
'Cause he has another
record most people
don't know about.

346
00:27:23,854 --> 00:27:26,516
He has the minor-league
strikeout record.

347
00:27:28,926 --> 00:27:30,826
Hello, Lionel.

348
00:27:30,894 --> 00:27:33,385
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.

349
00:27:33,463 --> 00:27:36,455
He would just swing
that bat as hard as
he could every time.

350
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:38,330
Didn't matter what
the coaches said,

351
00:27:38,402 --> 00:27:39,801
didn't matter who was on base.

352
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,033
He would just whip that
bat through the air
as hard as he could.

353
00:27:43,106 --> 00:27:46,405
Looked like a lumberjack
chopping down a tree.

354
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:50,503
Merrill here has
more strikeouts than
any two players.

355
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:53,345
You really got
the strikeout record?

356
00:28:00,257 --> 00:28:04,023
Felt wrong not to swing.

357
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,473
It's contaminated.

358
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:20,442
Carl, there's something wrong
with our water.

359
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,070
Your water's fine.

360
00:28:23,146 --> 00:28:25,808
Bo has this thing
about her drinking water.

361
00:28:25,883 --> 00:28:27,441
She had it her whole life.

362
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:31,214
It's like a tick
people have, except
it's not a tick.

363
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:34,257
Is that right?

364
00:28:34,324 --> 00:28:36,258
13!

365
00:28:36,326 --> 00:28:38,419
## Don't give me
that so-so-soda ##

366
00:28:38,495 --> 00:28:39,757
## That same old cola ##

367
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,320
## I wanna pop ##

368
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:44,094
- ## Pop, pop
I wanna... Shasta ##
- I'll take it.

369
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:47,330
I cursed 37 times last week.

370
00:28:47,404 --> 00:28:52,398
I said the "F" word
a couple times, but
mostly..."shits"

371
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:57,345
and..."bastards."

372
00:28:57,414 --> 00:28:59,848
Is "douche bag" a curse?

373
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:03,250
I suppose that would
depend on its usage.

374
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,118
How about, "John,
you're a douche bag
for kissing Barbara"?

375
00:29:06,189 --> 00:29:09,090
It's a curse.

376
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:14,096
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.

377
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:18,949
Pharmacy crowded?

378
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,650
I don't want any one of you

379
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:23,056
spending time with
Tracey Abernathy alone.

380
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:24,890
Is that understood?

381
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:46,376
Is that him?

382
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:53,352
Yeah.

383
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,513
Who is he?

384
00:30:49,513 --> 00:30:52,038
What is it?

385
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:54,913
It's Bo's baby monitor.

386
00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:56,680
I found it in the basement.

387
00:30:56,753 --> 00:30:59,244
I'm gonna use it
as a walkie-talkie.

388
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:07,888
What if it's catching
a signal from them?

389
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:12,234
It's not.

390
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:13,667
But it wasn't working.

391
00:31:13,737 --> 00:31:16,103
Morgan, this crop stuff
is about a bunch of nerds

392
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:18,232
who never had a girlfriend
in their lives.

393
00:31:18,308 --> 00:31:20,799
They're, like, 30, and
they work up little
codes together,

394
00:31:20,877 --> 00:31:23,937
and they analyze Greek
mythology and make up
secret societies

395
00:31:24,014 --> 00:31:27,074
where other guys who
never had girlfriends
before can join in.

396
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,550
They do stupid crap
like this to feel special.

397
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:30,779
It's a scam.

398
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:32,583
Nerds were doing it
25 years ago,

399
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:34,851
and new nerds
are doing it again.

400
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:41,729
It's just static, Morgan,
all right.

401
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:43,322
Turn it up. See.

402
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,703
It's a code.

403
00:31:48,772 --> 00:31:51,172
Why can't they get
girlfriends?

404
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:53,334
Can I see that, please?

405
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:03,784
It's noise.

406
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:06,687
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep
doing this.

407
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:08,246
Maybe some new batteries...

408
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:10,486
We might lose the signal.

409
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,960
This is exactly
what the nerds want.

410
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:17,031
I'm getting out now.

411
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:25,468
Nobody move.

412
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:31,137
Voices.
Did you hear that?

413
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:32,806
Not English, though.

414
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:35,215
You heard the voices,
right, Uncle Merrill?

415
00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:40,582
I heard them, Morgan.

416
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:48,828
Probably picking up
another baby monitor.

417
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,060
That's right.

418
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,040
Let me see it.

419
00:33:00,911 --> 00:33:02,776
Stop!

420
00:33:11,354 --> 00:33:15,586
See, this is why
we're not watching TV.

421
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:17,820
People get obsessed.

422
00:33:17,894 --> 00:33:19,054
I'm letting go now.

423
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:20,061
No, Dad!

424
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,222
Don't do it!

425
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:22,925
You'll lose the signal.

426
00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:26,731
Don't let go.

427
00:33:28,338 --> 00:33:31,307
It gets clearer
the higher you hold it.

428
00:33:35,111 --> 00:33:37,375
I got it.

429
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:42,184
Bo, honey, I don't want
you climbing on the car.

430
00:33:42,252 --> 00:33:43,412
Come here.

431
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:58,457
Stop!

432
00:34:00,236 --> 00:34:02,500
There's two of them talking.

433
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:15,301
Isabel, you're gonna
feel very silly

434
00:35:15,378 --> 00:35:19,246
when this turns out to be
all just make-believe.

435
00:36:55,944 --> 00:37:00,938
You're wasting your time here!

436
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:04,611
I'm not gonna report this or
anything you do to my crops

437
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:07,315
to the news or TV or anybody!

438
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:12,725
You're not going to get famous!

439
00:39:22,524 --> 00:39:25,186
Okay.

440
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,751
Let's turn on the TV.

441
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:35,765
It first appeared
52 minutes ago.

442
00:39:35,837 --> 00:39:39,534
Mexico City officials
as well as U. S. Officials

443
00:39:39,607 --> 00:39:41,837
have confirmed
that these are not aircraft

444
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:43,672
from either government's
air force.

445
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:47,475
The first sighting was made
by an Air Mexico 747

446
00:39:47,548 --> 00:39:50,381
en route from Mazatlán
to New York

447
00:39:50,451 --> 00:39:54,683
as the unidentified crafts
entered Mexico City air space.

448
00:39:54,755 --> 00:39:58,851
They were not detected by
radar by either country.

449
00:39:58,926 --> 00:40:00,860
The nerds were right.

450
00:40:00,928 --> 00:40:03,021
We have to tape this.

451
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:08,926
My ballet recital.

452
00:40:09,003 --> 00:40:11,301
Listen, Bo, this
is very important.

453
00:40:11,372 --> 00:40:15,900
Everything people have written
about in science books
is going to change.

454
00:40:15,977 --> 00:40:19,344
The history of the world's
future is on the TV right now.

455
00:40:19,413 --> 00:40:22,507
We need to record this
so you can show your
children this tape

456
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:24,744
and say you were there.

457
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:26,514
For your children, Bo.

458
00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:28,020
My ballet recital.

459
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:29,021
Dad!

460
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,751
Find another tape.

461
00:40:34,795 --> 00:40:37,559
Uncle Merrill,
I'm using your tape.

462
00:40:41,402 --> 00:40:43,927
You are seeing a live feed

463
00:40:44,005 --> 00:40:46,974
from our affiliate
down here in Mexico City.

464
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:51,671
This image has not been
adjusted or enhanced
in any way.

465
00:40:51,746 --> 00:40:53,839
What you're seeing is real.

466
00:40:53,915 --> 00:40:55,405
It's unbelievable.

467
00:40:55,483 --> 00:40:58,008
Everything they wrote
in science books

468
00:40:58,085 --> 00:40:59,177
is about to change.

469
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:00,743
I told you.

470
00:41:16,771 --> 00:41:19,035
Some people
are probably thinking

471
00:41:19,106 --> 00:41:20,937
this is the end of the world.

472
00:41:21,008 --> 00:41:23,602
That's true.

473
00:41:23,678 --> 00:41:26,442
Do you think it could be?

474
00:41:26,514 --> 00:41:29,108
Yes.

475
00:41:29,183 --> 00:41:31,242
How can you say that?

476
00:41:33,421 --> 00:41:36,049
That wasn't
the answer you wanted?

477
00:41:38,826 --> 00:41:42,057
Couldn't you pretend to be
like you used to be?

478
00:41:42,129 --> 00:41:44,893
Give me some comfort.

479
00:41:48,202 --> 00:41:53,037
People break down
into two groups

480
00:41:53,107 --> 00:41:56,042
when they experience
something lucky.

481
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:59,910
Group number one sees
it as more than luck,

482
00:41:59,981 --> 00:42:01,881
more than coincidence.

483
00:42:01,949 --> 00:42:04,782
They see it as a sign...

484
00:42:04,852 --> 00:42:07,878
evidence that there
is someone up there

485
00:42:07,955 --> 00:42:10,549
watching out for them.

486
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:14,755
Group number two sees
it as just pure luck,

487
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:17,320
a happy turn of chance.

488
00:42:17,398 --> 00:42:19,696
I'm sure the people
in group number two

489
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:23,100
are looking at those
14 lights in a very
suspicious way.

490
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:27,334
For them, the situation
isn't 50-50.

491
00:42:27,408 --> 00:42:31,640
Could be bad, could be good.

492
00:42:31,712 --> 00:42:34,146
But deep down,

493
00:42:34,215 --> 00:42:37,150
they feel that
whatever happens,

494
00:42:37,218 --> 00:42:39,652
they're on their own.

495
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,487
And that fills them with fear.

496
00:42:44,558 --> 00:42:49,086
Yeah, there are those people.

497
00:42:49,163 --> 00:42:53,691
But there's a whole
lot of people in
the group number one.

498
00:42:53,768 --> 00:42:56,896
When they see those 14 lights,

499
00:42:56,971 --> 00:43:00,498
they're looking at a miracle.

500
00:43:00,574 --> 00:43:05,409
And deep down, they feel that
whatever's going to happen,

501
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:09,575
there'll be someone
there to help them.

502
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:13,051
And that fills them with hope.

503
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,580
See, what you have to
ask yourself is, what
kind of person are you?

504
00:43:17,658 --> 00:43:22,755
Are you the kind who
sees signs, sees miracles?

505
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:26,288
Or do you believe that
people just get lucky?

506
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:30,326
Or look at the question
this way...

507
00:43:30,404 --> 00:43:35,239
is it possible that there
are no coincidences?

508
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,385
I was at this party once.

509
00:43:45,453 --> 00:43:48,650
I'm on the couch
with Randa McKinney.

510
00:43:48,723 --> 00:43:50,987
She was just sitting there

511
00:43:51,058 --> 00:43:54,721
looking beautiful,
staring at me.

512
00:43:54,795 --> 00:43:57,821
I go to lean in
and kiss her...

513
00:43:57,898 --> 00:44:02,062
and I realize
I have gum in my mouth.

514
00:44:02,136 --> 00:44:05,765
So I turn, take out the gum,

515
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,900
stuff it in a paper cup
next to the sofa,

516
00:44:08,976 --> 00:44:10,534
and turn around.

517
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:14,513
Randa McKinney throws up
all over herself.

518
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:21,349
I knew the second it happened
it was a miracle.

519
00:44:21,422 --> 00:44:25,358
I could have been kissing
her when she threw up.

520
00:44:25,426 --> 00:44:28,520
That would have
scarred me for life.

521
00:44:28,596 --> 00:44:32,054
I may never have recovered.

522
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:37,263
I'm a miracle man.

523
00:44:37,338 --> 00:44:39,806
Those lights are a miracle.

524
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,908
There you go.

525
00:44:43,978 --> 00:44:46,811
So, which type are you?

526
00:44:48,482 --> 00:44:50,677
Do you feel comforted?

527
00:44:53,254 --> 00:44:56,280
Yeah, I do.

528
00:44:56,357 --> 00:44:59,121
Then what does it matter?

529
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:08,301
I never told you
the last words

530
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:12,169
that Colleen said
before they let her die.

531
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:18,101
She said, "See."

532
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,076
Then her eyes glazed a bit.

533
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:27,518
And then she said,
"Swing away."

534
00:45:29,256 --> 00:45:31,417
You know why she said that?

535
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:37,422
Because the nerve
endings in her brain
were firing as she died,

536
00:45:37,498 --> 00:45:42,629
and some random memory of us
at one of your baseball games
just popped into her head.

537
00:45:49,143 --> 00:45:52,340
There is no one watching
out for us, Merrill.

538
00:45:54,081 --> 00:45:56,481
We are all on our own.

539
00:46:35,856 --> 00:46:37,756
What do you know?

540
00:46:37,825 --> 00:46:40,225
Well, there was an
accident... drunk driving,
they weren't sure...

541
00:46:40,294 --> 00:46:42,228
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.

542
00:46:42,296 --> 00:46:44,821
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

543
00:46:44,899 --> 00:46:48,027
That was the first thing
Colleen asked, too.

544
00:46:48,102 --> 00:46:50,400
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?

545
00:46:50,471 --> 00:46:52,939
She's not in an ambulance,
Father.

546
00:47:38,919 --> 00:47:40,216
For the kids' protection.

547
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,585
All they were doing was
watching TV from 5:00 a.m.

548
00:47:42,656 --> 00:47:45,022
I felt like they were
getting obsessed,
like you said.

549
00:47:45,092 --> 00:47:48,027
They should be playing
furry, furry rabbit or
tea party or something.

550
00:47:48,095 --> 00:47:49,528
What's furry, furry rabbit?

551
00:47:49,597 --> 00:47:50,859
It's a game, isn't it?

552
00:47:50,931 --> 00:47:52,990
Anyways, they closed
the schools.

553
00:47:53,067 --> 00:47:55,501
And there's been some
interesting developments.

554
00:47:55,569 --> 00:47:56,627
What time is it?

555
00:47:56,704 --> 00:47:58,001
11:00 a.m.

556
00:47:58,072 --> 00:48:01,769
They're gone, but they're
not really gone.

557
00:48:01,842 --> 00:48:03,070
We just can't see them.

558
00:48:03,143 --> 00:48:05,338
Early this morning,
a bird flew into the area

559
00:48:05,412 --> 00:48:07,880
where the lights were
hovering last night.

560
00:48:07,948 --> 00:48:10,576
It stopped dead in the air
and fell straight down.

561
00:48:10,651 --> 00:48:12,710
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing
it all morning.

562
00:48:12,786 --> 00:48:16,153
The footage looks like
the bird flew into
a wall in the sky.

563
00:48:16,223 --> 00:48:18,123
They found the bird. His...
his head was crushed in.

564
00:48:18,192 --> 00:48:22,288
They think they have some kind
of invisible-shield thing going,
l-like an optical illusion.

565
00:48:22,363 --> 00:48:27,630
They're still there,
hovering.

566
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:30,431
Some people think there's
more of them now...

567
00:48:30,504 --> 00:48:33,632
All over the place,
over us, even.

568
00:48:33,707 --> 00:48:36,642
There's a theory about
the c... the crop circles.

569
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:40,111
They could be some kind of...

570
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,478
some kind of landmark,

571
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:46,508
visual mapping system
so they could navigate,

572
00:48:46,587 --> 00:48:49,112
coordinate...

573
00:48:49,189 --> 00:48:51,521
makes sense.

574
00:49:04,668 --> 00:49:06,761
Want to hear a story?

575
00:49:13,777 --> 00:49:17,873
Is it true?

576
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:23,348
So the aliens can't
read our minds.

577
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:26,146
Oh.

578
00:49:26,223 --> 00:49:28,054
Oh, of course.

579
00:49:34,397 --> 00:49:36,524
They tell you everything
in this book.

580
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,398
It says they're probably
very small, like my height,

581
00:49:39,469 --> 00:49:41,130
because as their
brains develop,

582
00:49:41,204 --> 00:49:43,536
there was no use
for physical development.

583
00:49:43,607 --> 00:49:45,871
It also says they're
probably vegetarians

584
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:48,843
because they would
have realized the
benefits of such a diet.

585
00:49:48,912 --> 00:49:50,345
Who wrote this book?

586
00:49:50,413 --> 00:49:53,211
Scientists who have been
persecuted for their beliefs.

587
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:54,841
That means they're unemployed.

588
00:49:54,918 --> 00:49:57,182
If you're gonna make fun
of it, then forget it.

589
00:49:57,254 --> 00:49:59,518
This is serious.

590
00:50:03,527 --> 00:50:06,963
I don't know what got into me.

591
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,224
There are pictures.

592
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:11,131
Dr. Bimbu, one of the
authors of the book...

593
00:50:11,201 --> 00:50:12,259
- Bimbu?
- Dad.

594
00:50:12,335 --> 00:50:13,700
I just asked his name.

595
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:15,362
You had a tone.

596
00:50:16,973 --> 00:50:20,932
He said there are two
reasons why extraterrestrials
would visit us...

597
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:23,536
to make contact in
the spirit of exploration

598
00:50:23,613 --> 00:50:26,207
and furthering the
knowledge of the universe,

599
00:50:26,283 --> 00:50:28,581
or the other reason...
they're hostile.

600
00:50:28,652 --> 00:50:31,485
They've used up all the
resources on their planet,

601
00:50:31,555 --> 00:50:34,319
and they're looking to
harvest our planet next.

602
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:38,120
Here.

603
00:51:07,457 --> 00:51:10,517
Looks a little like
our house, doesn't it?

604
00:51:10,594 --> 00:51:12,960
Same windows.

605
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:14,656
That's weird.

606
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:32,805
Yeah, oh, yeah.

607
00:51:32,883 --> 00:51:35,374
That's enough from
Dr. Bimbu for now.

608
00:51:35,452 --> 00:51:38,216
Everybody in this house
needs to calm down

609
00:51:38,288 --> 00:51:40,518
and eat some fruit
or something.

610
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,889
Hello?

611
00:51:45,962 --> 00:51:48,328
Father?

612
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:50,593
Hello?

613
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:52,532
Hello?!

614
00:52:13,023 --> 00:52:14,854
I'm going out
for a few minutes.

615
00:52:14,925 --> 00:52:16,893
No one leaves this house...
no one.

616
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,325
Where you going?

617
00:52:18,395 --> 00:52:21,193
Ray Reddy's house.

618
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:22,196
Why?

619
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:24,096
I think he just called here.

620
00:52:31,942 --> 00:52:35,275
You don't think
something bad will happen,

621
00:52:35,345 --> 00:52:37,245
do you, Morgan?

622
00:52:37,314 --> 00:52:41,114
Why? You have one of
your feelings again?

623
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,649
Is it bad?

624
00:52:47,924 --> 00:52:51,416
I won't let anything bad
happen to you.

625
00:52:51,494 --> 00:52:54,759
I don't want you to die.

626
00:52:54,831 --> 00:52:57,664
Who said I was gonna die?

627
00:53:00,236 --> 00:53:02,397
Who said I was gonna die?

628
00:54:24,448 --> 00:54:26,382
Hello, Ray.

629
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:44,926
What happened?

630
00:54:45,002 --> 00:54:48,631
I wrote your number
down to call you.

631
00:54:51,608 --> 00:54:54,839
It's been sitting next to
the phone for 6 months.

632
00:54:58,482 --> 00:55:00,780
When I knew it was
inside the house...

633
00:55:00,851 --> 00:55:06,346
I couldn't think of any
other number to call.
I panicked.

634
00:55:06,423 --> 00:55:08,618
Thank you for coming,
Father.

635
00:55:08,692 --> 00:55:11,286
You're welcome, Ray.

636
00:55:11,362 --> 00:55:15,230
I worked so long that night.

637
00:55:15,299 --> 00:55:18,291
I've never fallen asleep
driving before...

638
00:55:18,369 --> 00:55:19,734
never since.

639
00:55:19,803 --> 00:55:20,963
Don't.

640
00:55:21,038 --> 00:55:23,029
Most of the ride home,

641
00:55:23,107 --> 00:55:27,043
there wasn't a car in sight
in either direction.

642
00:55:27,111 --> 00:55:29,875
If I'd have
fallen asleep then,

643
00:55:29,947 --> 00:55:33,883
I would have ended up in
a ditch with a headache.

644
00:55:33,951 --> 00:55:37,546
And it had to be at that
right moment...

645
00:55:37,621 --> 00:55:42,490
that 10, 15 seconds when
I passed her walking.

646
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,154
It was like
it was meant to be.

647
00:55:54,638 --> 00:55:56,936
I guess if this is
the end of the world,

648
00:55:57,007 --> 00:55:59,771
I'm screwed, right?

649
00:55:59,843 --> 00:56:02,141
People who kill
reverends' wives

650
00:56:02,212 --> 00:56:07,240
aren't exactly ushered
to the front of the
line in Heaven.

651
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:12,015
Wh... Where
are you going, Ray?

652
00:56:13,791 --> 00:56:15,258
To the lake.

653
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:20,028
The way I see it...

654
00:56:20,097 --> 00:56:22,531
these places marked
in crops and such...

655
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:25,727
none of them are
really near water.

656
00:56:25,803 --> 00:56:29,796
I don't think they like water.

657
00:56:29,907 --> 00:56:32,876
Can't be any worse than here.

658
00:56:32,943 --> 00:56:36,743
Did you see something, Ray?

659
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:40,245
I know what I've done to you.

660
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:42,444
I made you question
your faith.

661
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:49,319
I'm truly sorry for what
I've done to you and yours.

662
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:00,765
All right.

663
00:57:03,307 --> 00:57:05,332
And don't open
my pantry, Father.

664
00:57:05,409 --> 00:57:07,900
I found one of them in
there and locked him in.

665
00:57:17,549 --> 00:57:19,483
The startling footage
we're about to show you

666
00:57:19,551 --> 00:57:22,418
was photographed by a
42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.

667
00:57:22,488 --> 00:57:24,786
This video was taken
yesterday afternoon

668
00:57:24,857 --> 00:57:26,222
at his son's 7th birthday

669
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,350
in the city of
Passo Fundo, Brazil.

670
00:57:28,427 --> 00:57:30,793
It was sent to the local
news bureau there

671
00:57:30,863 --> 00:57:33,730
and sent to us via satellite
just a few minutes ago.

672
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:37,030
All initial opinions are
this is genuine.

673
00:57:37,102 --> 00:57:40,333
What you're about to see
may disturb you.

674
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,594
Move, children!
Vámanos!

675
00:58:22,848 --> 00:58:24,145
Oh!

676
00:59:23,374 --> 00:59:24,864
Hello?

677
00:59:33,084 --> 00:59:36,349
The police are here.
I am with them.

678
00:59:36,421 --> 00:59:38,389
I am a police officer.

679
00:59:40,391 --> 00:59:43,952
I just want to
talk with you.

680
00:59:44,028 --> 00:59:46,053
We know all about the hoax.

681
00:59:48,266 --> 00:59:52,100
We already took some of
your friends downtown
in a paddy wagon.

682
00:59:57,175 --> 01:00:00,338
Just tell us your name
and why you did it,

683
01:00:00,411 --> 01:00:04,211
and we'll give you the same
deal we gave the others.

684
01:00:04,282 --> 01:00:06,876
Don't throw your
life away, son.

685
01:01:36,741 --> 01:01:38,675
Oh! Ah!

686
01:01:38,743 --> 01:01:40,540
Oh!

687
01:02:20,351 --> 01:02:22,478
Their skin changes colors.

688
01:02:22,553 --> 01:02:25,181
That's why we couldn't
see them that night.

689
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:28,887
Tell me something, Morgan.

690
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,259
Uh... in this
book of yours...

691
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:34,321
did they happen to detail

692
01:02:34,399 --> 01:02:37,596
what would happen
if they were hostile?

693
01:02:37,669 --> 01:02:39,660
Yes.

694
01:02:39,737 --> 01:02:42,035
It said they would
probably invade.

695
01:02:42,106 --> 01:02:46,702
They would use
ground tactics...
hand-to-hand combat.

696
01:02:46,778 --> 01:02:49,906
They wouldn't use our
technology or fight
an airborne battle

697
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:52,677
'cause they know eventually
we would use nuclear weapons.

698
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:55,378
Then the planet would
be useless to them.

699
01:02:55,453 --> 01:02:59,685
How could anyone possibly
know that information?
It's ridiculous.

700
01:02:59,757 --> 01:03:01,122
What else did it say?

701
01:03:01,192 --> 01:03:04,559
They said there are one of
two outcomes of an invasion.

702
01:03:04,629 --> 01:03:08,065
One, they fight
and are defeated and
have to return again

703
01:03:08,132 --> 01:03:11,898
with full forces
hundreds, maybe even
thousands, of years later.

704
01:03:11,969 --> 01:03:15,336
What's two?

705
01:03:15,406 --> 01:03:18,807
They win.

706
01:03:18,876 --> 01:03:22,812
I'm sorry, what...
what book is this?

707
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,849
Is this really happening?

708
01:03:30,021 --> 01:03:32,182
I heard a theory that, uh,

709
01:03:32,256 --> 01:03:35,282
they don't like
places near water.

710
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:38,988
Maybe we'd be safe from them
near a lake or something.

711
01:03:39,063 --> 01:03:41,497
Sounds made-up.

712
01:03:50,675 --> 01:03:53,701
I saw one of them
at Ray Reddy's house.

713
01:03:53,778 --> 01:03:55,769
I can't be sure,

714
01:03:55,847 --> 01:03:58,839
but I got the distinct feeling
he wanted to harm me.

715
01:04:00,985 --> 01:04:02,919
So...

716
01:04:02,987 --> 01:04:07,924
we can choose to believe this
lake idea, pack up, and go,

717
01:04:07,992 --> 01:04:12,759
or we can stay here, hide
inside our home, wait it out.

718
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:17,995
We might be overreacting, but
I'm willing to live with that.

719
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:23,336
Either way, at least
we'll be together.

720
01:04:23,407 --> 01:04:26,399
All those in favor of
the lake idea, raise your hand.

721
01:04:28,913 --> 01:04:32,280
Yeah.

722
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:35,342
All those in favor of home,
raise your hand.

723
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,624
Okay.

724
01:04:41,692 --> 01:04:43,523
My vote counts as two.

725
01:04:43,594 --> 01:04:45,221
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!

726
01:04:45,296 --> 01:04:46,661
Morgan, calm down.

727
01:04:46,731 --> 01:04:48,926
I get two votes because
I represent two parents here.

728
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,093
We don't know anything yet.

729
01:04:51,169 --> 01:04:54,263
We'll be safe here anyway.

730
01:04:54,338 --> 01:04:56,272
I don't want to leave home.

731
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:59,036
This is where
we lived with Mom.

732
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:01,772
That's got nothing
to do with this.

733
01:05:01,846 --> 01:05:04,246
I change my vote.

734
01:05:04,315 --> 01:05:05,509
You can't change your vote.

735
01:05:05,583 --> 01:05:09,110
All those in favor of home,
raise your hand.

736
01:05:09,187 --> 01:05:11,451
This is ridiculous.

737
01:05:11,522 --> 01:05:13,990
You lose, 3-2.

738
01:05:30,007 --> 01:05:34,273
We're going to board up
every window in this house.

739
01:05:34,345 --> 01:05:38,008
How do we know boards
will do anything?

740
01:05:38,082 --> 01:05:43,179
Because they seem to have
trouble with pantry doors.

741
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:48,714
The information we're receiving

742
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:50,980
comes from our affiliates
across the world.

743
01:06:51,054 --> 01:06:54,387
Dad, Uncle Merrill!

744
01:06:57,294 --> 01:07:00,957
Amman joins Nairobi,
Beijing, and Jerusalem

745
01:07:01,031 --> 01:07:04,330
as the latest to confirm
the appearance of lights.

746
01:07:06,469 --> 01:07:10,064
There are lights
in over 274 cities.

747
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:13,871
They think it'll be
400 within the hour.

748
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:17,971
They're appearing at or within
one mile of crop signs.

749
01:07:18,048 --> 01:07:20,539
They were for navigation.

750
01:07:20,617 --> 01:07:22,710
They made a map.

751
01:07:22,786 --> 01:07:27,155
They're gonna be
within a mile of us.

752
01:07:27,223 --> 01:07:28,952
Dad?

753
01:07:29,025 --> 01:07:30,390
Yes?

754
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:33,327
They think these are staged

755
01:07:33,396 --> 01:07:36,832
immediately preceding
an attack maneuver.

756
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:41,303
I was wrong.
They're hostile.

757
01:07:44,174 --> 01:07:47,166
It's like "War of the Worlds."

758
01:07:47,243 --> 01:07:48,938
Ground forces
have been assembled

759
01:07:49,012 --> 01:07:51,947
in countries
throughout the globe.

760
01:07:53,183 --> 01:07:54,480
Hundreds of thousands

761
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:57,577
have flocked to temples,
synagogues, and churches.

762
01:08:03,793 --> 01:08:07,126
God be with us all.

763
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:21,806
I'm going to get back
to the windows.

764
01:08:31,454 --> 01:08:33,854
Hey, you guys okay?

765
01:08:33,923 --> 01:08:38,986
Some guy had a sign saying
it was the end of the world.

766
01:08:39,062 --> 01:08:40,654
Don't worry.

767
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:45,260
You won't let anything
happen to us, right?

768
01:08:45,335 --> 01:08:46,825
No way.

769
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:51,667
I wish you were my dad.

770
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:54,505
What did you say?

771
01:08:54,577 --> 01:08:57,671
Don't you ever say anything
like that again.

772
01:08:57,747 --> 01:08:59,237
Ever.

773
01:09:36,649 --> 01:09:38,810
There's too many windows
in the bedrooms.

774
01:09:38,885 --> 01:09:40,477
We don't have enough boards.

775
01:09:40,553 --> 01:09:42,350
We'll board up
the bedroom doors.

776
01:09:42,422 --> 01:09:43,889
Where are we gonna sleep?

777
01:09:43,957 --> 01:09:45,219
In the family room.

778
01:09:45,291 --> 01:09:46,952
What about Isabel?

779
01:09:47,026 --> 01:09:50,189
We'll tie her up in the garage
after dinner.

780
01:09:50,263 --> 01:09:52,754
I'll make some sandwiches.

781
01:09:52,832 --> 01:09:54,424
I want spaghetti.

782
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,661
We'll just eat fast, Bo.

783
01:09:56,736 --> 01:09:58,761
Spaghetti sounds great.

784
01:09:58,838 --> 01:10:01,068
What do you want, Morgan?

785
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:04,109
Anything?

786
01:10:04,177 --> 01:10:06,475
French toast...

787
01:10:06,546 --> 01:10:09,413
and mashed potatoes.

788
01:10:09,482 --> 01:10:11,450
Now we're talking.

789
01:10:11,517 --> 01:10:13,985
How about you, Merrill?

790
01:10:16,689 --> 01:10:19,658
Chicken teriyaki.

791
01:10:19,726 --> 01:10:22,524
Good choice.

792
01:10:22,595 --> 01:10:26,224
I'm going to have
a cheeseburger with bacon.

793
01:10:28,234 --> 01:10:30,566
Extra bacon.

794
01:10:56,662 --> 01:10:59,756
What's the matter
with everyone? Eat.

795
01:10:59,832 --> 01:11:01,766
Maybe we should say
a prayer.

796
01:11:01,834 --> 01:11:02,766
No.

797
01:11:02,835 --> 01:11:03,927
Why not?

798
01:11:04,003 --> 01:11:06,198
We're not saying a prayer.

799
01:11:06,272 --> 01:11:08,069
Bo has a bad feeling.

800
01:11:08,141 --> 01:11:09,506
I had a dream.

801
01:11:09,575 --> 01:11:12,237
We aren't saying a prayer.

802
01:11:12,311 --> 01:11:13,972
Eat!

803
01:11:14,047 --> 01:11:15,309
I hate you.

804
01:11:16,916 --> 01:11:18,508
That's fine.

805
01:11:18,584 --> 01:11:20,074
You let Mom die.

806
01:11:20,153 --> 01:11:21,780
Morgan.

807
01:11:24,824 --> 01:11:28,885
I am not wasting one more minute
of my life on prayer.

808
01:11:28,961 --> 01:11:31,555
Not one more minute.

809
01:11:31,631 --> 01:11:33,861
Understood?

810
01:11:33,933 --> 01:11:36,367
Now we are going
to enjoy this meal.

811
01:11:36,436 --> 01:11:39,496
No one can stop us from enjoying
this meal, so enjoy it!

812
01:11:39,572 --> 01:11:41,335
Stop crying!

813
01:11:41,407 --> 01:11:43,671
- Graham...
- Don't yell at her!

814
01:11:45,945 --> 01:11:48,072
All right, since you're
all not gonna eat.

815
01:11:48,147 --> 01:11:49,944
I'm gonna try
some of everything.

816
01:13:03,417 --> 01:13:05,908
It's happening.

817
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:38,009
Graham, hurry.

818
01:14:02,443 --> 01:14:04,377
Did I ever tell you
what everyone said

819
01:14:04,445 --> 01:14:06,276
when you were born, Bo?

820
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:13,548
You came out of your mama,
and you didn't even cry.

821
01:14:13,621 --> 01:14:15,248
You just opened your eyes,

822
01:14:15,322 --> 01:14:18,155
and you looked around
the room at everybody.

823
01:14:18,225 --> 01:14:21,217
Your eyes
were so big and gorgeous.

824
01:14:21,295 --> 01:14:24,196
All the ladies in the room
just gasped.

825
01:14:24,264 --> 01:14:26,960
I mean, they literally gasped.

826
01:14:27,034 --> 01:14:30,663
And they go,
"Oh, she's like an angel."

827
01:14:30,738 --> 01:14:34,230
And they said, "We've never
seen a baby so beautiful."

828
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:40,337
And then... you know
what happened?

829
01:14:40,414 --> 01:14:43,679
They put you on the table
to clean you up,

830
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:46,879
and you looked up at me
and you smiled.

831
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:52,925
They say babies that young
can't smile.

832
01:14:52,993 --> 01:14:55,052
You smiled.

833
01:14:57,231 --> 01:14:59,665
Let's go down now.

834
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:23,449
We forgot Isabel.

835
01:16:02,162 --> 01:16:05,427
Should we turn off the lights?

836
01:16:05,499 --> 01:16:08,662
They already know we're here.

837
01:17:02,523 --> 01:17:05,253
Dad...

838
01:17:16,003 --> 01:17:19,268
Do you know what happened
when you were born, Morgan?

839
01:17:19,339 --> 01:17:22,001
You came out, and your mama
kept bleeding,

840
01:17:22,075 --> 01:17:24,669
so the doctors rushed you
out of the room

841
01:17:24,745 --> 01:17:26,975
before I even had time
to see you.

842
01:17:29,082 --> 01:17:30,879
They're on the roof.

843
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:32,942
While they were fixing her up,

844
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,215
all she kept asking about
was you.

845
01:17:37,024 --> 01:17:38,855
They're in the house.

846
01:17:38,926 --> 01:17:42,054
I wanted your mama
to see you first

847
01:17:42,129 --> 01:17:46,259
because she had dreamed
about you her whole life.

848
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:49,268
Then she got feeling better,
they brought you in,

849
01:17:49,336 --> 01:17:51,395
and they placed you
in her arms,

850
01:17:51,471 --> 01:17:55,100
and she looked at you,
and you looked at her,

851
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:59,441
and you just stared at each
other for the longest time.

852
01:17:59,513 --> 01:18:01,708
And then she said real soft,

853
01:18:01,782 --> 01:18:06,446
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.

854
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,455
You look
just how I dreamed."

855
01:18:29,042 --> 01:18:31,442
The attic door.

856
01:18:34,147 --> 01:18:35,273
Let's go.

857
01:18:35,349 --> 01:18:36,475
Come on.

858
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:53,594
We forgot our foil helmets.

859
01:18:53,666 --> 01:18:55,930
Have we got anything to wedge
against the door knob?

860
01:18:56,002 --> 01:18:57,026
They'll read our minds.

861
01:18:57,103 --> 01:18:58,400
You're scaring your sister.

862
01:18:58,471 --> 01:19:00,564
I'm already scared.

863
01:19:03,876 --> 01:19:05,343
Merrill.

864
01:19:05,411 --> 01:19:06,469
I'm looking!

865
01:19:06,546 --> 01:19:08,013
They'll know
our secret thoughts.

866
01:19:23,463 --> 01:19:26,762
I'm not ready.

867
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:28,198
Merrill!

868
01:19:28,267 --> 01:19:29,757
Got it!

869
01:19:29,836 --> 01:19:32,600
Dad!

870
01:20:02,602 --> 01:20:05,901
Where's Bo?

871
01:20:13,412 --> 01:20:15,903
I'm okay.

872
01:20:46,179 --> 01:20:49,546
What's happening out there?

873
01:20:49,615 --> 01:20:51,674
I can't even imagine.

874
01:20:51,751 --> 01:20:54,276
I hope they're doing better
than we are.

875
01:20:54,353 --> 01:20:57,618
We don't even have helmets.

876
01:21:11,003 --> 01:21:15,736
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.

877
01:21:15,808 --> 01:21:17,776
Why would they do that?

878
01:21:17,843 --> 01:21:20,437
They want our attention
on the door?

879
01:21:22,515 --> 01:21:23,982
They're distracting us.

880
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:25,312
From what?

881
01:21:25,384 --> 01:21:28,251
The book says they're probably
very good problem solvers.

882
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:31,779
They'll find a way in.

883
01:21:35,361 --> 01:21:37,591
Morgan,
give me your flashlight.

884
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:47,462
They used to pour coal
down in this basement.

885
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,974
There's a coal chute in here.

886
01:22:03,389 --> 01:22:06,085
I can feel air.

887
01:22:06,158 --> 01:22:08,092
Me too!

888
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,821
It's getting stronger.

889
01:22:09,895 --> 01:22:11,362
I'm close.

890
01:22:23,542 --> 01:22:24,941
What?

891
01:22:26,545 --> 01:22:27,739
Hold him!

892
01:22:27,813 --> 01:22:29,110
I got him!

893
01:22:29,181 --> 01:22:30,341
Hold him!

894
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:31,713
I got him!

895
01:22:31,784 --> 01:22:32,978
Hold him!

896
01:23:30,643 --> 01:23:33,043
We don't have his medicine.

897
01:23:38,317 --> 01:23:40,046
Don't be afraid, Morgan.

898
01:23:40,119 --> 01:23:42,485
We'll slow this down
together.

899
01:23:42,555 --> 01:23:44,250
Feel my chest.

900
01:23:44,323 --> 01:23:47,190
Feel it moving in and out.

901
01:23:47,259 --> 01:23:49,056
Breathe like me.

902
01:23:49,128 --> 01:23:50,925
Breathe like me.

903
01:23:50,996 --> 01:23:52,623
Come on.

904
01:23:52,698 --> 01:23:55,189
I dreamed this.

905
01:23:55,267 --> 01:23:56,461
Stay with me.

906
01:23:56,535 --> 01:23:59,766
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.

907
01:23:59,839 --> 01:24:03,138
It'll pass.

908
01:24:03,209 --> 01:24:06,110
It'll pass.

909
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:25,294
Don't do this to me again.

910
01:24:25,364 --> 01:24:27,161
Not again.

911
01:24:31,537 --> 01:24:35,064
I hate you.

912
01:24:35,141 --> 01:24:37,575
I hate you.

913
01:24:41,514 --> 01:24:44,506
The fear is feeding him.

914
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:47,074
Don't be afraid
of what's happening.

915
01:24:47,153 --> 01:24:50,145
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.

916
01:24:50,222 --> 01:24:54,249
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.

917
01:24:54,326 --> 01:24:58,319
The air is coming.
Believe.

918
01:24:58,397 --> 01:25:00,991
We don't have to be afraid.

919
01:25:01,066 --> 01:25:03,534
It's about to pass.

920
01:25:03,602 --> 01:25:08,130
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.

921
01:25:08,207 --> 01:25:11,142
Here comes the air.

922
01:25:19,585 --> 01:25:22,019
Don't be afraid, Morgan.

923
01:25:22,087 --> 01:25:25,454
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.

924
01:25:25,524 --> 01:25:29,585
Together. The air
is going in our lungs.

925
01:25:29,662 --> 01:25:31,892
Together.

926
01:25:31,964 --> 01:25:35,798
We're the same.

927
01:25:35,868 --> 01:25:37,893
We're the same.

928
01:25:48,881 --> 01:25:52,476
We should save
the flashlights.

929
01:26:05,263 --> 01:26:08,027
Ray's truck
swerved off the road

930
01:26:08,099 --> 01:26:11,591
and hit Colleen
and then a tree,

931
01:26:11,669 --> 01:26:15,127
and she was pinned
between the two.

932
01:26:15,206 --> 01:26:18,300
What does that mean...
pinned?

933
01:26:18,376 --> 01:26:19,673
The truck...

934
01:26:19,744 --> 01:26:23,737
the truck has severed
most of her lower half.

935
01:26:23,815 --> 01:26:25,373
What did you say?

936
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:28,476
She won't be saved.

937
01:26:28,553 --> 01:26:31,750
Her body is pinned
in such a way

938
01:26:31,823 --> 01:26:35,884
that it's alive when it
shouldn't be alive,

939
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,987
and the truck is
holding her together.

940
01:26:40,064 --> 01:26:41,691
And she doesn't feel much,

941
01:26:41,766 --> 01:26:44,667
and she's... she's talking
almost like normal,

942
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,897
and we didn't
pull the truck out

943
01:26:46,971 --> 01:26:49,132
'cause we... we wanted you
to come down here

944
01:26:49,207 --> 01:26:52,404
and be with her
as long as she's awake.

945
01:26:52,477 --> 01:26:55,241
And that won't be very long.

946
01:26:56,981 --> 01:27:01,077
Now, Father, do you understand
what I've told you?

947
01:27:03,221 --> 01:27:05,655
Caroline...

948
01:27:05,723 --> 01:27:09,124
is this the last time I'm
gonna talk with my wife?

949
01:27:10,361 --> 01:27:12,420
Yes, it is.

950
01:27:35,553 --> 01:27:37,544
People think they came here
to take over the planet.

951
01:27:37,622 --> 01:27:41,183
That's bull.
I don't think that.

952
01:27:41,259 --> 01:27:43,784
My friend and I saw them.

953
01:27:43,862 --> 01:27:46,228
I found a pack
of light bulbs.

954
01:27:46,297 --> 01:27:48,959
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.

955
01:27:51,002 --> 01:27:54,130
Nobody believes it,
but they didn't come here
for our planet.

956
01:27:54,205 --> 01:27:55,467
This is a raid.

957
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:58,873
They came here for us,
to harvest us.

958
01:28:02,247 --> 01:28:05,546
We're lucky as hell
they're leaving here.

959
01:28:05,617 --> 01:28:07,517
They're leaving?

960
01:28:07,585 --> 01:28:10,247
That's what they're saying.

961
01:28:11,823 --> 01:28:14,314
How long
have we been sleeping?

962
01:28:14,392 --> 01:28:15,689
12 hours or so.

963
01:28:17,362 --> 01:28:21,526
He said
they had poison gas...

964
01:28:21,599 --> 01:28:25,660
they secrete in small amounts.

965
01:28:25,737 --> 01:28:28,729
A lot of people died.

966
01:28:28,806 --> 01:28:30,899
But they're leaving.

967
01:28:30,975 --> 01:28:32,806
They left real fast
this morning,

968
01:28:32,877 --> 01:28:34,606
like something
scared them off.

969
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:36,840
They left some
of their wounded behind.

970
01:28:40,752 --> 01:28:43,653
Why are they going?

971
01:28:43,721 --> 01:28:46,713
People must have figured out
a way to beat them.

972
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:48,986
Everyone has a weakness,
right?

973
01:28:56,267 --> 01:28:59,759
You didn't think we'd make it
through the night, did you?

974
01:29:01,673 --> 01:29:03,197
No.

975
01:29:05,877 --> 01:29:07,777
Listen...

976
01:29:07,845 --> 01:29:13,750
there's things I can take
and a couple things I can't.

977
01:29:13,818 --> 01:29:17,879
One of them I can't take
is when my older brother,

978
01:29:17,956 --> 01:29:20,720
who's everything
I want to be...

979
01:29:20,792 --> 01:29:23,352
starts losing faith
in things.

980
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:28,524
I saw your eyes last night.

981
01:29:28,599 --> 01:29:31,693
I don't want to ever see
your eyes like that again.

982
01:29:31,769 --> 01:29:35,899
Okay? I'm serious.

983
01:29:40,044 --> 01:29:41,602
Okay.

984
01:29:46,951 --> 01:29:49,886
He's been like that
for a while.

985
01:29:49,954 --> 01:29:52,115
He needs his medicine.

986
01:29:53,958 --> 01:29:56,756
Have they said anything
about our area?

987
01:29:56,828 --> 01:30:00,491
Philadelphia and its outlying
counties are cleared...

988
01:30:00,565 --> 01:30:03,159
but who knows for sure?

989
01:30:03,234 --> 01:30:05,862
He's not strong enough.

990
01:30:05,937 --> 01:30:08,030
If he has another attack
right now...

991
01:30:08,106 --> 01:30:09,368
I know.

992
01:30:11,509 --> 01:30:15,309
We'd have to be sure before
we opened up that door, Graham.

993
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:41,037
It's good enough for me.

994
01:30:41,105 --> 01:30:42,094
Me too.

995
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,307
Get the syringes' well.

996
01:31:50,374 --> 01:31:53,207
We may need to give him
an epinephrine shot.

997
01:32:15,566 --> 01:32:18,626
The atmosphere here is
cautiously optimistic.

998
01:32:18,703 --> 01:32:21,171
- People are celebrating.
- They're doing this on TV.

999
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:23,036
There's a great sense
of relief.

1000
01:32:23,107 --> 01:32:25,132
- They're dancing.
- Yeah, like this.

1001
01:32:25,209 --> 01:32:27,541
As we begin evaluating
the loss of life,

1002
01:32:27,612 --> 01:32:31,378
- Do you want to see it?
- We will be left with
a lot of questions.

1003
01:32:31,449 --> 01:32:35,476
- I'll bring the TV in here.
- I see the same expression
on every face.

1004
01:32:35,553 --> 01:32:38,317
We know the battle turned
around in the Middle East.

1005
01:32:38,389 --> 01:32:41,984
Three small cities there
found a primitive method
to defeat them.

1006
01:32:42,059 --> 01:32:44,289
We have no further details
at this time.

1007
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:19,523
Merrill, wait.

1008
01:34:19,257 --> 01:34:22,317
Hi, sweetie.

1009
01:34:22,393 --> 01:34:24,384
Hi, baby.

1010
01:34:24,462 --> 01:34:30,196
I was... just taking a walk
before dinner.

1011
01:34:30,268 --> 01:34:33,066
You love walks.

1012
01:34:33,137 --> 01:34:36,504
It was meant to be.

1013
01:34:36,574 --> 01:34:39,065
Does it hurt?

1014
01:34:39,143 --> 01:34:41,304
I don't feel much.

1015
01:34:41,379 --> 01:34:42,971
Good.

1016
01:34:50,454 --> 01:34:52,615
Tell Morgan...

1017
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:54,920
to play games.

1018
01:34:54,992 --> 01:34:56,425
It's okay to be silly.

1019
01:34:56,494 --> 01:34:58,223
I will.

1020
01:34:58,296 --> 01:35:01,754
Tell Bo to listen
to her brother.

1021
01:35:01,832 --> 01:35:04,426
He'll always take care
of her.

1022
01:35:04,502 --> 01:35:05,491
I will.

1023
01:35:05,569 --> 01:35:07,560
And tell Graham...

1024
01:35:07,638 --> 01:35:09,936
I'm here.

1025
01:35:10,007 --> 01:35:12,567
Tell him...

1026
01:35:12,643 --> 01:35:14,440
see.

1027
01:35:14,512 --> 01:35:17,447
Tell him to see.

1028
01:35:21,152 --> 01:35:24,087
And tell Merrill
to swing away.

1029
01:35:28,726 --> 01:35:32,856
See, what you have to ask
yourself is, what kind
of person are you?

1030
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:36,957
Are you the kind that sees
signs, sees miracles?

1031
01:35:37,034 --> 01:35:41,266
Or do you believe that
people just get lucky?

1032
01:35:41,339 --> 01:35:48,836
Is it possible...
there are no coincidences?

1033
01:36:14,804 --> 01:36:17,272
Swing away, Merrill.

1034
01:36:19,676 --> 01:36:21,644
Merrill...

1035
01:36:21,711 --> 01:36:23,702
swing away.

1036
01:36:42,699 --> 01:36:45,862
Ahhhhhhhhh!

1037
01:37:48,631 --> 01:37:49,996
Ahhhh!

1038
01:38:21,865 --> 01:38:24,095
That's why he had asthma.

1039
01:38:28,371 --> 01:38:30,601
It can't be luck.

1040
01:38:30,673 --> 01:38:33,437
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.

1041
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:36,206
No poison got in.
No poison got in.

1042
01:38:36,279 --> 01:38:39,612
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.

1043
01:38:39,682 --> 01:38:42,116
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.

1044
01:38:44,254 --> 01:38:46,381
Graham...

1045
01:38:46,456 --> 01:38:49,323
Give him a second.

1046
01:38:49,392 --> 01:38:50,689
D-Daddy...

1047
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:52,193
Don't touch him.

1048
01:38:55,498 --> 01:38:57,090
Graham...

1049
01:38:59,903 --> 01:39:04,738
Don't... don't.

1050
01:39:04,808 --> 01:39:07,402
Dad?

1051
01:39:07,477 --> 01:39:09,638
What happened?

1052
01:39:19,255 --> 01:39:22,349
Did someone save me?

1053
01:39:24,093 --> 01:39:27,290
Yeah, baby,
I think someone did.
