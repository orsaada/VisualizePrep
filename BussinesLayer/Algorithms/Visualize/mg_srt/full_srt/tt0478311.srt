00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,869
It's gonna be tough.
Tough job.

168
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,736
About the work,
most immediately,

169
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,072
there's gonna be
some things that you're
gonna be able to get...

170
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,407
ALLISON: Okay.
...that other people
in the office don't get.

171
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,378
One of them, gym membership.

172
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,676
You want me to lose weight?

173
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,380
(LAUGHING) No, I don't
want you to lose weight.

174
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,852
No. We can't legally
ask you to do that.

175
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,254
We didn't say lose weight.
I might say tighten.

176
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,484
Tight.

177
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,585
A little tighter?

178
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,596
Just like toned and smaller.

179
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:22,395
Don't make everything smaller.
I don't want to
generalize that way.

180
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,662
Tighter.

181
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,204
We don't want you
to lose weight. We just
want you to be healthy.

182
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,366
Okay.
You know, by eating less.

183
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,503
We would just like it
if you go home
and step on a scale

184
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,015
and write down
how much you weigh
and subtract it by, like, 20.

185
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,916
Twenty.
And then weigh that much.

186
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,682
Just remember,
you've got it here,
you've got it here

187
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,884
and everybody's gonna
see you right there.

188
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,292
Yay! That's so exciting!
Oh, my God!

189
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,488
Hey!

190
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,623
Huh?

191
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,098
I got a promotion.

192
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,759
Oh, congratulations!
Thank you.

193
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,268
Hey, maybe you can
get your own place now.

194
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,134
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

195
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,729
Yay!
Let's go celebrate.

196
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,468
Okay. Let's do it.

197
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,271
Pete'll watch the kids?
Yeah!

198
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,209

Taxicab Confessions.</i>

199
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,872
What are you gonna do?
I don't know!

200
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,472
(BOTH SCREAMING)

201
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,881
I'm so excited!

202
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,150
I walked in on him
masturbating one night.

203
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,484
Did he get the
deer-in-the-headlights look?

204
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,615
(LAUGHING)
Did he freeze
or did he finish?

205
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,718
No, he tried to pretend
like he wasn't doing
anything under the covers.

206
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,024
(BOTH LAUGHING)

207
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,794
Oh, no!

208
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,097
I buy these nice towels,
and he whacks off into them.

209
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,400
Deb and Pete, forever.
And...

210
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:37,272
And once he does that
into them once,
they're never soft ever again.

211
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:44,273
I can always tell if I'm
looking good based on
whether or not we get in.

212
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,985
Ladies?
Guess we're looking good.

213
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,350
If I didn't get in,
I would've lost my shit.
What's going on, man?

214
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,320
How long you gonna
make us wait out here,
for Christ's sake?

215
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,516
What the fuck?

217
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,489

saw again the other day,

218
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,091
<i>mind-blowing,
and I haven't seen it

219

220
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,105
<i>Oh, man, Munich fucking rules.
Munich is awesome!</i>

221
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,336
That movie was Eric Bana
kicking fucking ass!

222
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,638

we're the ones getting killed.

<i>Munich flips it on its ear.
We're capping motherfuckers.</i>

224

it's because
of Eric Bana in Munich.</i>

I agree.

You know what is not
helping us get laid

228
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,552
is the shoe bomber,

230

Fuck you guys.
I'm glad I'm not Jewish.

Yeah, so are we.

Yeah. Fine, screw it.

You weren't chosen
for a reason.
Yeah.

What?

237
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,239
Am I too old to be here?
No, of course not.

238
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,839
Does it look weird
that I'm here?

239
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,145
No, not at all.

00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,948
Am I hotter than
these little bitches?

241
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,989
Yes! You look amazing.

00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,251
Guys in here would
fuck me, right?
Yes.

243
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,054
That's weird to say,
but it makes me feel better.

244

You look hot.

245
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,120
Okay. I believe you.

246
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,062
Okay. I'm getting us drinks.
Okay.

247
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,929
Yo, a beer over here, please?

248
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,562
You're gonna be embarrassed
when you realize
I'm Wilmer Valderrama.

00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,764
God.

250
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,509
Hey, hey! Excuse me!

251
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,670
He's literally ignoring
this entire half of the bar.

252
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,737
Don't even bother.

253
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,839
Yeah, awesome.

254
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,044
A beer over here, please?

255
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,781
He looked at us!
Did you see that?
Yeah, that was rough.

256
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,188
Oh, my God. And if
you can't get service,
what am I gonna do, you know?

257
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,386
Great. It's gonna be
that night.

258

Okay, you want a beer?
Yeah, just...

Okay? Just observe.

261

There you go.
Come on, man.

262
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,404
Here you go. For your trouble.
Thank you. There you go.

263
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,770
Thank you.
Okay, enjoy it.

264
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,138
Are you sure?
I am sure.

265
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,473
I tried that once before
at the Comedy Store,
and I got punched in the ear.

266
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,807
Thanks a lot.

267
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,405
Oh, fuck, fuck!
I'm supposed
to get one for my sister.

268
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,475
Oh, here, take mine.
No, that's okay. I'll wait.

269
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:05,614
Please, I very rarely
look cool. This is a big
moment for me. Just take it.

270
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,158
Thank you. Awesome.
No problem.

I'm Ben.

00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,188
Well, have a great night.
Yeah, you, too.

273
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,097
Thanks for the beer.
Okay, enjoy, be nice to them.

274
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,433
Bye. Thanks again.
I'll see you.
No, I'll see you later.

No, I won't
'cause I'm a pussy.

What's up, Ben?

277
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,947
That girl. She totally
gave me an opening, man,
and I locked up.

278
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,006
I just want to get
shit-faced tonight,
though, you know.

279
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,847
I'll just jerk it later.
It's cool.

280
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,946
Are you fucking crazy, man?
She looks smart.

281
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,389
Who's that she's sitting with?
It's her sister.

282
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,619
Her sister?
Yeah.

283
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,026
Dude, it's the dream.
What are we doing
standing here, man?

284
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,155
Let's go. Come on, follow me.
You stay here. Stay here.

285
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,894
Why?
Because your face
looks like a vagina.

286

00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,001

the sister?

Hey, Crockett,
you still partying
with Tubbs these days?

289
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,707
Come on, man. I'm getting
it from all angles here.

290
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,804
I don't like it anymore.
I know. I don't, either.

291
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,908
Was it weird when you changed
your name from Cat Stevens
to Yusuf Islam?

292
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,315
Yeah, it was really awkward.

293
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,354
All right, man.
I got to take off.

294
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,218

You know, it's Chewie.

how my beers were doing.

Hi. Ben?
Yes.

Nice to meet you.

307

How you doing?
Good, how are you?

Just trying not to stare.

309
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:39,810
She's married.

310
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,250
Why do you have to say that?

311
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,184
What?
It's a shame.

312
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,415
You're beautiful.

313
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,479
Thank you.

314
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,286
She has two kids, too.

315
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,485
Shut up!

316
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,789
What? It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

317
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,522
You think that's gonna
stop him from hitting on her?

318
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,155
It's not at all.

319
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,824
I love kids.

320
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,060

Yeah, absolutely.

have the chicken pox.

three times.

to tell him it's herpes.

It's not herpes
if it's everywhere.

Yeah, I'll take a cab home.

the dice thing too much.

the secret. Like you gotta...

I mean, once you're hung-over,
you just gotta puke.

it's gross or anything.

for a hangover is weed.

No, I just don't.

It is like the best medicine.

We had a great time.

440
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,749
Yeah.

441
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,251
So what do you do?

442
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,582
I work at E!

Wow!

We had this
conversation last night.

446
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,820
I told you about my promotion.
I was out celebrating it.

447
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,494
No?
No.

448
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,998
I don't remember that at all.

449
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,398

excited about it.

about him?
What?

454
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,871
Nothing.
What?

455
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,706
Will you tell him
he's an asshole for me?
No.

456
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,803
Someone needs to.
Like who gives a shit?

457
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,044
Well, I hope a lot of people,
actually, because that's
what my job entails

458
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,312
is making sure people care
what he has to say.

459
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,149
I'm interviewing him.

460
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,849
Maybe it's just me. Maybe
I just don't give a shit.

461
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,357
I'm just saying
he deserves a beat-down.

462
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,620
Actually, it's sort
of embarrassing
to ask at this point,

463
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,720
but what do you do for work?

464
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,197

have started a... We're
starting an Internet website.

you wanna know every movie
where she shows her tits.

but how long into that
movie she shows her tits.

She's, like, naked
that whole fucking movie.

480
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,196
She does full frontal
in that movie.
Wow.

481

They should've called her
Harry, not Sally.
Really.

Can I get your number?

to contact me, I don't have
a cell, right now,

Why did you do it?

Aunty Allison drank
too much chocolate milk.

00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,009
And I was feeling weird
because of that.
And I made a...

506

Okay.

Yes.

you'll do it again?
No, no way.

She just really
didn't seem to like me.

513

I mean, I'm like a funny guy.

Fucking funny as balls.
Hilarious, man.

515

Nothing. She thought our

that you had sex with her.

00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:54,689
BEN: 6:00. Beat the rush.
Yeah, leaves
more time for afterwards.

673

674
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,619
Okay, great.

675
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,529
So, yeah. I'll just meet
you there, then, at 6:00.

676
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,567
Yeah.
I'll see you there.

677

678
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,498
Okay, take care. Peace.

681
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,539
I'm gonna get laid,
motherfucker!

683
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,442
Yes! Yes!

00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,278
BEN: Nice place, huh?
ALLISON: Yeah,
it's really nice.

685
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,617
Sorry it took so long to
get a table. I didn't realize
you needed a reservation.

686
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,053
Oh, no, that's okay.

687
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,421
So how's work?
Great.

688
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,617
How's E!?
Great.

689
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,250
That's awesome.
Do you know Vince Vaughn?

690
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:31,589
Have you ever met him?
No.

691
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:35,188
I really feel like
we'd get along well. I just...
He seems like a fun guy.

692
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,131
I feel like we'd, like,
hang together well.
Mmm-hmm.

693
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,226
I feel like he'd like me.

694
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:41,272
I'm sure a lot of guys
are like, "Oh, I'd like
to hang out with that celeb",

695
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:44,273
but I really think he would
want to hang out with me,
is like the cool thing.

696
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,240
I'm sure he would. Yeah.

697
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,608
You look very pretty, though.
Thanks.

698
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,043
By the way.
Yeah, I just thought...

699
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,444
I don't know, I thought
maybe it'd be cool

700
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:51,640
to hang out
a little bit and...

701
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,876
We didn't really get
to talk that much
last time, so I thought...

702
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,419
That we didn't.

703
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:00,421
I thought maybe we'd
just talk and get to know
each other better.

704
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,459
Cool. Okay.

705
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,052
I'll start. I'm Canadian.
Oh, that's cool.

706
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,963
From Vancouver. I live
here illegally, actually.

707
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,125
Don't tell anyone.

708
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:13,102
But it works out
in my advantage,
I think, ultimately,

709
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,162
'cause I don't have
to pay any taxes.

710
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:18,572
So financially that's helpful

711
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,168
'cause I don't have
a lot of money.

712
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:25,410
You know, I mean,
I'm not poor or anything,
but I eat a lot of spaghetti.

713
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:29,783
So, you know, the web page
or whatever is just something
that you guys do for fun?

714
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,151
Do you have a real job?

715
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,814
Well, that is our job.
Oh.

716
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:36,052
We don't technically get money
for the hours we put in,

717
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,560
but it is our job.

718
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,460
So, how do you... Right.
How do I pay rent and shit?

719
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,657
When I was in high school,
I got ran over
by a postal truck.

720
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:42,926
Oh, my God.
It just kind of...

721
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,662
It was my foot
more than anything.

722
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,796
But I got like 14 grand from
the British Columbia government.

723
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,500
Right.
And that really lasted me.

724
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,939
I mean, until now.

725
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,171
It's been almost 10 years.
I have like 900 bucks left.

726
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,009
So that should last me for,
like, I mean, I'm not
a mathematician,

727
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,515
but like another
two years or some shit.
I think.

728
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:00,675
Yeah.

729
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,753
So I have something
I really need to tell you.

730
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,448
It's kind of why I called you.

731
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,514
Here goes. Um...

732
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,457
I'm pregnant.

733
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,051
Fuck off.
What?

734
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,993
What?
I'm pregnant.

735
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,332
With emotion?

736
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,834
With a baby.
You're the father.

737
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,627
I'm the father?
Yes.

738
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,195
How the fuck
could this happen?
I don't know.

739
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,298
I don't know. I mean,
I thought you were
wearing a condom.

740
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,501
No.
What?

741
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,043
I wasn't.
Why not?

742
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,373
Because you told me not to.

743
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,878
What are you talking about?

744
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,812
What am I talking about?
You told me not to.

745
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,351
I did not tell you
not to wear a condom.

746
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,545
Here's what happened, okay?

747
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,088
I will give you a play-by-play
of my memory.

748
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,851
I almost had
the condom on my dick.

749
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,018
It was on the cusp,
and then you said,
"Just do it, already."

750
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,425
I didn't mean do it
without a condom.

751
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,258
I meant "do it"
like "hurry up,"

752
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,491
like "Get fucking going!"

753
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,033
Well, I assumed
you were wearing a patch,
or like a dental dam

754
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,433
or one of those
fucking butterfly clips
or something like that.

755
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,266
What the hell is a dental dam?
It's like Saran Wrap!

756
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,670
It's disgusting, okay?
But I thought you had one.

757
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,606
Why the fuck didn't you
stop me once we started?

758
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,076
I don't know! I couldn't tell
that you didn't have one on!

759
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,612
Obviously, I was drunk!

760
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,011
Was your vagina drunk?

761
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,107
Did you think
it's the thinnest condom
on earth I have on?

762
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,879
I'm a fucking inventor?
I made a dick-skin condom?

763
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,581
He hollowed out
a penis and put it on?

764
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,850
What the fuck?

765
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,623
You are unbelievable.

766
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:23,230
Okay, you know what? Maybe
I've reacted unfavorably.

767
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,270
So what happens now?
I don't know how this works.

768
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,771
I am going to
the doctor next week,

769
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,070
and I thought you could
come with me
to the gynecologist.

770
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,804
So you haven't seen him,
though?
No.

771
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,276
So you don't know
if you're pregnant.

772
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,248
Well, I'm not 100% sure.
You're not 100% sure.

773
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,784
I bet you're not pregnant.

I help you with today,

that's the amniotic sac.

in the middle is the embryo.

you are pregnant.

you didn't wear a bag!

Why did we go to Costco
and buy a year's supply
of condoms

if you weren't gonna
use them, man?

is not to get yourself
in this position.

That's what
you have to realize.

828

You gotta know
all the tricks.

829
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,541
Like, for example,
if a woman's on top,
she can't get pregnant.

830

with "Shma-shmortion."

839
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,205
I'm just saying...
Hold on, Jay, cover your ears.

840
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:55,973
You should get
a shma-shmortion
at the shma-shmortion clinic.

841
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,481
Ben, you cannot let
these monsters have
any part of your child's life.

842
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,451
All right? I'm gonna be
there to rear your child.

843
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,248
You hear that, Ben?
Don't let him near the kid.

844
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,654
(LAUGHING) He wants
to rear your child!

845
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,088
I just have a quick question.

846
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,560
Do you use that Canadian
flag tattoo as a cum target
of some sort?

847
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,757
How many points do you get if you hit
the leaf? Like a million?

848
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,595
Jonah, I am a patriot.

849
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,329
This is a tribute to my
country and my countrymen.

850
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,598
I always aim right.

851
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,572
Right into a dude's ass.

852
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,908
Please, guys.

853
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,140
Ben, come on, man.
I'm just kidding you.

854
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,273
Oh, great. Now he's upset.
I won't let him do it.

855
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,316
Allison, just take care of it.

856
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:36,946
Take care of it. Move on.

857
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,283
What's gonna happen
with your career?

858
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,721
How are you gonna tell them?

859
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,984
I'm not gonna tell them
for a while.

860
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,026
I have a while
before I have to say anything.

861
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,119
How could you not tell them?
They're not gonna know.

862
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,959
I mean, I'm only gonna start
to show when I'm like,

863
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,329
I don't know,
six months or something.
Seven months.

864
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,923
Three months.
No.

865
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:54,199
Three months. Fat in the face,
jowls, fat ass.

866
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,599
Debbie didn't get fat.

867
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,539
Debbie is a freak of nature.

868
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:02,306
Mom, you know,
it's important to me
that you be supportive.

869
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,339
I cannot be supportive
of this. This is a mistake.
This is a big, big mistake.

870
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,145
Now, think about
your stepsister.

871
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,550
Now, you remember
what happened with her?

872
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:13,317
She had the same
situation as you,
and she had it taken care of.

873
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,383
And you know what?
Now she has a real baby.

874
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,394
Honey, this is not the time.

875
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,730
I'm gonna be a grandfather.

876
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:21,923
You happy about that?

877
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,660
Absolutely. Delighted.

878
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:24,826
This is a disaster.

879
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,096
No, this is not a disaster.

880
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,695
It is...
An earthquake is a disaster.

881
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,831
Your grandmother
having Alzheimer's so bad

882
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,502
she doesn't even know
who the fuck I am,
that's a disaster.

883
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,477
This is a good thing.
This is a blessing.

884
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:39,482
I have a vision
for how my life would go,

885
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,074
and this definitely is not it.

886
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,882
Wait. Is this your vision?
Are you living
your vision right now?

887
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,182
I am kind of living
my vision, yeah.

888
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,087
Well, that is sad,
I'm telling you.

889
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,592
Life doesn't care
about your vision. Okay?

890
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:52,026
Stuff happens.
You just got to deal with it.

891
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,929
You roll with it.
That's the beauty of it all.

892
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:58,263
I just don't get how I tell
the kid not to do drugs
when I do drugs.

893
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,563
I'll feel like a hypocrite.

894
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,730
Well, remember what I told you
when you were a teenager?

895
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,774
What did you say?
I said,
"No pills, no powders."

896
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:05,933
That's right, that's right.

897
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,443
Right. If it grows
in the ground,
it's probably okay.

898
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,743
I mean, I guess it worked.
Like you told me not
to smoke pot all those years,

899
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,875
and then I found out
you were smoking pot
that whole time.

900
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,442
Not the whole time.

901
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,284
Just in the evenings
and all day every weekend.

902
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,914
Not that much.

903
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:26,361
Honestly, though,
when you look at me
do you not think at all, like,

904
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,057
"You know,
if he just never existed,

905
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,465
"I would have avoided
a massive heap of trouble,"
you know?

906
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,196
Absolutely not.

907
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,431
I love you totally
and completely.

908
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,905

00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:56,230
I don't know,
at least 10 years.
At least!

1005
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,131
God, I mean, honestly,
I just got used to the, like,

1006
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,967
notion that someone would even
have sex with me.

1007
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,234
I didn't think
this would happen.

1008
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,401
Get ready.

1009
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,239
This will be coming out of you
in seven months.

1011
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,243
This is exactly what
our baby will look like.

1012
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:14,010
It's a beautiful picture, Ben.
It is. It's not bad.

1013
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,210
Hello, Mommy.

1014
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,946
Our baby's gonna be
French-Canadian.

1015
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,181
With a little hint
of Spanish.

1016
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:21,190
(LAUGHING)
Exactly. I'm not good
with accents, but...

1017
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:23,385

00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,363
Well, you can't eat sushi.

1021

You can't smoke.

1022
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,736
You can't smoke marijuana.
You can't smoke crack.

1023

You can't jump on trampolines.

1024

This is basically a giant list
of things you can't do.

1025
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:40,866
Yeah, it sounds thrilling.

1026
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,639
I'm gonna be sitting there
on the trampoline
smoking crack.

1028
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,008
And you're not gonna have
anything to do.
You're gonna be bored.

1029
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,710
But I can't wait
to read these, honestly.

1030
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,479
Seriously, I put these
in front of my toilet, though,

1031
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,248
they'll be read
by tomorrow morning.

1032
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,686
Do you want me
to get you that?
Yeah.

1033
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:54,155
You like it?
Yeah, thank you.

1034
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,486
No problem.

1035
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,220

Should we have sex tonight?

I'm just really constipated.

1041
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,084
Do you really want to?

1042
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,484
Well, now...

1043
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,954
Shut up.

1044
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,956
It's pretty crazy,
your sister's pregnant.

1045
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,458
We have to help her.

1046
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:32,393
I think they'll be fine.
Look at us. It happened to us.

1047
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,658
We'll help her raise the baby.

1048
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:35,960
Well...

1049
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,029
Fuck!

1050
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:48,241
At least we don't have
to use a condom, you know?

1051
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:52,544
But we can. I don't...
I brought some
just in case. I don't...

1052
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:55,050
I don't have VD or anything.
I mean, I don't, I thought...

1053
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,347
It's not that.

1054
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,751
You know, it's just...

1055
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:02,383
I thought maybe we could get
a little fun out of
your situation, you know?

1056
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:05,326
Okay, first of all,
it's not my situation.
It's our situation.

1057
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,726
I know, of course,
I know that.

1058
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,628
And just because I'm pregnant,
I'm not some ruined woman

1059
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,131
and all romance
goes out the door.

1060
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,134
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

1061
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,271
It's just...

1062
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,341
I like you a lot.
That's all this is. That's...

1063
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,341
I like you, too.

1064
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,813
Sweet.

1065
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,814
A little, so far.

1066
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,852
I mean, we have seven months
before the baby comes.

1067
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,614
We don't have to rush it.
Yeah.

1068
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,657
We should really just try
to get to know each other

1069
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,658
and give this a real shot.

1070
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,957
You know, we got ourselves
into this situation.
We kind of have to.

1071
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,362
For the baby, right?
Exactly.

1072
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,335
Okay, if this was our second
date, what would you do?

1073
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:53,307
B.J., if I'm just being
honest, I would probably...

1074
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:57,438
I told my roommates
I thought I was gonna
get a B.J., so...

1075
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:58,606
You know what?

1076
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,515
For the sake of getting
to know one another,
can you not talk like that?

1077
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:05,486
Yeah, I can do that.
I'm... I'm really nervous.

1078
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,421
I'm nervous, too.
I'm really nervous.

1079
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,049
Yeah.

1080
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,028
You're a sweet guy, right?

1081
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,574
I think I am. Yeah.

1082
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,701
Don't fuck me over, okay?

1083
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,807
I wouldn't do that.

1084
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:34,048
Just so you know,
I'm the guy girls fuck over.

1085
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,244
I'm that guy.
So you don't fuck me over.

1086
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,411
Okay?
Okay.

1087
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,854
I couldn't take it.
I can't raise this baby alone.

1088
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,638
Who's he?

1089
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,336
I'm Ben Stone.

1090
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,109
He's my boyfriend.

1091
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:06,742
That's nice.

1092
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,511
I've never met him before.

1093
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,416
Well, he's a new boyfriend.

1094
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,714
But a boyfriend.

1095
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:14,951
So he came over
for breakfast because
he's your new boyfriend?

1096
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,923
DEBBIE: Yeah.
He came from his house.

1097
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,688
Drove over to our house

1098
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:21,595
because he thought
it would be fun
to have breakfast with us,

1099
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:25,794
so he drove his car
from his house to our house
to have breakfast.

1100
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,030
Because he likes
breakfast so much.

1101
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,039
I love breakfast.

1102
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:34,271
You guys wanna hear something neat?
We're gonna have a baby together.

1103
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,369
SADIE: What?
Yeah, a baby.

1104
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,777
Well, you're not married.

1105
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,974
Aren't you supposed
to be married to have a baby?

1106
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,277
You don't have to be.

1107
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,615
But they should be
because they love each other,

1108
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,212
and people who love each other
get married and have babies.

1109
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,280
Mmm-mmm.

1110
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,388
Do you love each other?

1111
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,793
Yes, they love each other.
Because that's what you do.

1112
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:57,890
When you love each other,
you get married
and have a baby.

1113
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,629
Where do babies come from?

1114
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,727
DEBBIE: Where do you think
they come from?

1115
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:05,104
Well, I think a stork,
he drops it down,

1116
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,268
and then a hole goes
in your body,

1117
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,744
and there's blood everywhere,
coming out of your head,

1118
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:13,180
and then you push
your belly button,
and then your butt falls off,

1119
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,343
and then you hold your butt
and you have to dig,

1120
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,648
and you'll find a little baby.

1121
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,620
That's exactly right.

1122
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,855
Feed the teddy bear.

1123
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,485
Okay, I feed
your bear the grass?

1124
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,592
Okay.

1125
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,465
You know what your bear
would also like
to do with some grass?

1126

(LAUGHING) Smoke it.

1127
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:37,471
What do you think of him?
He's funny, right?

1128
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,769
Mmm-hmm.

1129
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:40,469
Fetch.

1130
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,307
All right, bring it back.

1131
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,171
He's playing fetch
with my kids.

1132
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,749
He's treating my kids
like they're dogs.

1133
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,216
No, he's not.

1134
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,513
Go get it! Fetch!

1135
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,520

with kids?

1136
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,714
ALLISON: He's trying.
He's making an effort.

1137
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,224
BEN: Bring it back.
He's overweight.

1138
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,691
Where does that end?

1139
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,557
How old is he?
23.

1140
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,028
Looks 33.

1141
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:04,361
He can barely get in and out
of that little house.

1142
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,402
Imagine how much bigger
he's gonna get.

1143
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,698
That means he has bad genes.

1144
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,035
Your kid is gonna
be overweight.

1145
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,405
Shit.

1146
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,033
I'm gonna get you!

1147

Okay. I'll try.

1153
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,160
They seem to love bubbles.

1154
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,360
Oh, God. They go
ape shit over bubbles.

1155
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,527
They're really going ape shit.

1156
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:43,095
I mean, that's an incredible
thing about a child.

1157

I mean, what's so great
about bubbles?

1158
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,938
They float. You can pop them.
I mean, I get it. I get it.

1159

I wish I liked anything as much
as my kids like bubbles.

1160

That's sad.
It's totally sad.

1161
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:58,620
Their smiling faces just
point out your inability
to enjoy anything.

1162

any money, you know?

00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:25,907
So?

1172
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,643
I can't ref the next games,
by the way.

1173
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,720
I got to go meet
gynecologists with Allison.

1174
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,778
She doesn't like
her gynecologist.

1175
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:35,289
JAY: You think she likes you?
She's trying to.

1176
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:39,093
She's entertaining
the idea of liking you.
Exactly. I'll take that.

1177
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:41,562
Yeah, well, see,
she's bringing you
to the gynaechiatrist.

1178
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,826
She must like you.
Yeah. Pretty good, I think.

1179
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,664
You know who
I'd like to get pregnant,
is that Felicity Huffman, man.

1180
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,170
<i>Ever since Transamerica, I can't
get her out of my mind.</i>

1181
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,502
Okay, guys. I hate to
crack the whip,

1182
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,736
but it's kind of
business meeting time.

1183
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,176
I need moolah.

1184
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,804
When do you think
we can launch this site?
Jeez.

1185
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:00,405
Look, man. You can't rush this.

1186
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,179
You know what happens
to these sites when they go up

1187
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,946
and they don't function well?
They die.

1188
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,512
Seriously, guys, let's say
I want to launch today.

1189
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,422
Let's start. Let's use that
as a jumping off point.

1190
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,519
Let's make this happen.
What can we do?

1191
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,325
Look, man, I didn't go
to Yale so I could work
12 hours a day.

1192
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,956
I thought you went
to Santa Monica City College.

1193
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,591
I went where I went, Jason.

1194
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,533
BEN: I'm not asking you
to work 12 hours a day.

1195
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,265
I mean, you guys watch movies
without nudity in them.

1196
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,173
I'll tell you what, man.
We could probably
get it online in three months.

1197
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,937
Thank you. Yes! Three months.

1198
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,876
JONAH: Come on, Jason!

1199
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,379
Fuck off!

1200
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,847
Yeah, well, you still have
a little dick, Cartman.

1201
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,881
Do you have mints?
Yeah, right there.

1202
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,852
I see what you're saying.
Totally.

1203
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:40,855
I don't get how
you're comfortable
with any of these guys

1204
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:42,652
when they're doing
what they're doing to you.

1205
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,853
First guy...

1206
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,725
Oh, there that shit is.
I've been looking for that.

1207
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,800
The first guy,
when he put his finger in,
he gave me this look like,

1208
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:55,736
"Sorry, man, it's the job"
and I'm like, "Don't look
at me when your finger's..."

1209
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,672
I mean, get in and get out.
Get on with your day,
you know?

1210
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:02,234
That's the closest
I'll ever come to being
in a threesome, I think.

1211
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,403
Really?

1212
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,981
If you had to do a threesome
with me and one
of my other roommates,

1213
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,641
who would it be?

1214
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:08,706
Um...

1215
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:10,410
I'm gonna have to go with Jay.

1216
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:11,715
Oh, no.

1217
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:12,981
Yeah.
Jay?

1218
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:16,219
I'm really turned on by his
sort of skinny awkwardness

1219
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:19,090
and his hot little Mohawk.
His Mohawk.

1220
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,529
You two are never allowed to be in
the same room ever again.

1221
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:25,727
If we ever had a three-way
with Jay, you turn around,
he'd be sucking my dick.

1222
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:26,927
(ALLISON LAUGHING)
I'm telling you right now.

1223
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,505
Do you smoke cigarettes?
No.

1224
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,269
Do you smoke cigarettes?

1225
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,775
I have on occasion.

1226
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:36,073
On occasion? When? When was
the last time you had one cig?

1227
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,646
You know, one, you know, little...

1228
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,342
I need to know,
or I will not be your doctor.

1229
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,681
How you doing?

1230
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:46,916
I'm breathing like James
Gandolfini over here.

1231
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,392
Slow down, man.
You're making me look
like a jackass.

1232
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,121
How long you kids
been married?

1233
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,526
We're not.
No.

1234
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:54,586
You're single?

1235
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,030
She's not single.
She's just not married.

1236
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,091
Are you two together?

1237
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,361
Hey, you wanna
trade boyfriends?

1238
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:03,463
(LAUGHS)

1239
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,770
Just kidding. Kind of.

1240
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:09,667
(EXCLAIMS)

1241
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:15,149
That is not your vagina.
That's your asshole.

1242
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,117
That happens
about five times a day.

1243
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:19,718
Are you sure you don't
wanna come paintballing?

1244
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,984
Have fun, guys. Seriously.
Watch the eyes.

1245
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,889
See you, guys.
JASON: See you, Ally. Bye.

1246
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,293
I don't wanna go.
I swear to God.

1247
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,957
<i>I wanna see Breathless
at the LACMA.</i>

1248
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,635
Boobs! Boobs, boobs, boobs!

1249
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,136
Hold on, pause it,
pause it, pause it.

1250
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,763
Boobs and bush!
Boobs and bush.

1251
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,501
Good boobs.
Those are good ones!

1252
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,405
We're like
35 seconds in. Nice.

1253
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,308
Right in
the beginning credits.
Credit bush.

1254
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,846
You never get
opening credit bush.
I know. That's so crazy.

1255
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:46,642
No.

1256
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,684
You got me.

1257
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,580
You got me.

1258
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,415
How many doctors are there
in your practice?

1259
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:57,016
Just 'cause I'm sort of
looking for a more
personal experience.

1260
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,255
I wanna make sure
that you're my doctor
on the day, and...

1261
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,127
Yeah, I understand.

1262
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:07,026
We have three other doctors
in the practice,
but I'm your man, okay?

1263
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,867
I don't take vacations.
I hate Hawaii.

1264
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,405
I went to the Caribbean
when I was 14,

1265
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,807
(ALL LAUGHING)
and I'm never going back.

1266
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,278
I feel really good about this.
I think we found our doctor.

1267
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,541
Really?
Yeah.

1268
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,910
All right.

1269
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,349
Are you serious right now?
Yeah.

1270
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,612
Wow.

1271
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,814
You look relieved.
I am very relieved.

1272
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,982
I can't imagine meeting
any more of you people.

1273
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,923
You're being dramatic.
We didn't meet that many.

1274
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,867
Do they know?

1275
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,063
Pardon?

1276
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,240
The belly.

1277
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:47,936
Oh, yeah. The donuts,
they call to me.

1278
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:51,608
Hey, Allison. Great job.
Thanks.

1279
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,880
You're pregnant, aren't you?
What?

1280
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:59,546
I mean, you've put on like,
eight pounds, nine.

1281
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,556
It's all in your uterus.

1282
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:03,489
Oh, shit.

1283
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:07,353
I haven't told them.
Do you think
they're gonna be mad?

1284
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,955
I'm, like, really
chickening out about this.

1285
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,058
It's okay. We can hide this.

1286
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:15,797
We'll dress you in black,
and we'll emphasize
your boobs.

1287
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,032
Awesome.

1288
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,700
I mean, your boobs
are gonna be big.

1289
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,073
And then they're
gonna be, like, scary big.

1290
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:25,807
But then they'll go down.
And then they'll stay down.

1291
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,544
Just... Just don't
say anything, okay?
Please don't say anything.

1292
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:32,417
Oh, no, I won't, I won't.
Just tell them. They'll be cool.

1293
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,883
Everybody loves
somebody pregnant.

1294
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,923
Did you see
this sex offender website?

1295
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:43,693
These are all the sex
offenders in our neighborhood.

1296
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,701
Looks like your computer
has chicken pox.

1297
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,464
Those are sex offenders.

1298
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,870
These people live
in our neighborhood.

1299
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,805
Well, I'll skip their houses
when we're trick-or-treating.

1300
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,276
What do you want me to do?
Form a posse?

1301
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,711
Got your six-shooter on you?
I got my lynching rope.

1302
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,008
You shouldn't take it
so lightly.

1303
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,242
I don't take it lightly.

1304
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:03,012
You know, I'm not gonna
go over to any of these
people's houses and say,

1305
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,212
"Hey, do you mind...
Can you baby-sit?"

1306
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:07,221
If I didn't care about
these things,

1307
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,814
you wouldn't
care about anything.

1308
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,052
Care more.

1309
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,720
You're so concerned
with stuff, like
"Don't get them vaccinated.

1310
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,127
"Don't let them eat fish.
There's mercury in the water."

1311
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:17,792
<i>Jesus, how much
Dateline NBC can you watch?</i>

1312
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:20,335
I know we're supposed
to be nice
with each other right now,

1313
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:21,734
but I'm having
a really hard time.

1314
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:23,965
I'm struggling
with it right now.
What am I doing?

1315
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,170
'Cause I want to rip your
fucking head off because
you're so fucking stupid!

1316
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:31,509
This is scary.
These are our children.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

1317
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:35,381
You fucking dipshit.
God! You...
Mmm-hmm.

1318
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:38,079
I literally am at a point where
I don't know what I can say.

1319
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,348
So I'm the bad guy

1320
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:42,585
because I'm trying to protect
our kids from child molesters
and mercury?

1321
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:45,092
And you're cool
'cause you don't give a shit.

1322
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,686
Yeah.
Yeah? Is that it?

1323
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:50,494
Pretty much.
God, you're an asshole.

1324
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,762
Don't do this in front of Ben.

1325
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,997
I don't give a shit about Ben.

1326
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,265
Sorry, Ben.

1327
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:58,330
It's okay. I didn't think
she did, anyway.

1328
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,069
Okay, come on! Let's go.

1329
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,770
Oh, I can't go.

1330
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,678
This band is doing a showcase
out in the Valley. I got to go.

1331

It's Saturday.

1332
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,077
I got to go.

1333
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,420
DEBBIE: You don't want to know
the sex of the baby?

1334
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,183
That's no fun.

1335
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:16,623
Ben knows, but I've
sworn him to secrecy.

1336
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,387
I'll get it out of him.

1337
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,587
No.

1338
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:27,530
Hey.

1339
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:30,767
Think we'll ever be as happy
as Baby Bjrn couple is?

1340
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,603
We are that happy.

1341
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,433
Yeah. You look happy.

1342
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:37,104
Which is awesome,
'cause I never like
guys like you. It's great.

1343
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:38,976
You keep saying that. I know.

1344
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:41,312
This is it. This is perfect.

1345
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,416
Nice.

1346
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,420
Holy shit! It's 1,400 bucks.

1347
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:47,285
We can just borrow yours.
Is that okay?

1348
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,382
No. You need your own crib.

1349
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,087
You know, there's one
of these lying in an alley
behind my house.

1350
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:54,823
We could just grab that.
Just rub Purell all over it.

1351
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,296
You know what? Let me buy it.

1352
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,197
I need to get you
a baby present anyway.

1353
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,293
And I would love
to get it for you.
ALLISON: No.

1354
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,665
I'm serious. I want to.

1355
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,706
No. It's too much.

1356
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,034
(SHUSHING)

1357
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:06,973
Yes. We'll take it.

1358
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:10,170
Obviously, I mean,
don't insult the woman.
She wants to get us a gift.

1359
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,304
Right.

1360
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:14,178
Wanna buy me some new shoes?
What else can I
squeeze out of you?

1361
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,115
Xbox 360. Xbox 360.

1362
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:19,778
So hot in the Valley.

1363
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:23,019
ASHLEY: Hey! Oh, Allison!
GIRL: Hi.

1364
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,684
How are you?

1365
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:27,285
It's so good to see you.

1366
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:29,422
We've been watching you on E!
It's the coolest thing.

1367
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,524
Yeah, it's been super
exciting, just crazy busy.

1368
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,124
I'm so sorry I haven't called.

1369
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:34,669
GIRL: Oh, it's fine.
Hi, I'm Ashley.

1370
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:35,931
This is my friend, Ben.
I'm Ben.

1371
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,336
I went to school with Allison.

1372
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,340
Okay, so, is Debbie
having another baby?

1373
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,809
No. Allison is.

1374
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,642
What? I just saw you
a couple months ago.
You're pregnant?

1375
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,705
It was a big surprise.

1376
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:48,943
It's actually... It's a really
funny story, actually.

1377
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,508
If you guys... If you got
a second to hear it.

1378
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,178
It's not really funny.
It's not funny.

1379
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,052
Let them be the judge, okay?
I think it's funny.

1380
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,955
You know they say
don't drink and drive?
Uh-huh.

1381
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:59,392
BEN: Don't drink and bone!
GIRL: Wow.

1382
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:00,553
Okay.

1383
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:03,721
Yeah, I mean,
she was acting weird,

1384
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,427
and I really think
it's just 'cause, like,

1385
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,469
you know, I haven't made
an honest woman out of her.

1386
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:10,028
She's carrying my bastard child.
No one wants that.

1387
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:12,334
That's what I did.
I mean, I married Debbie
when she got pregnant.

1388
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:13,966
You think she's, like,
hiding me?

1389
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,409
Like, she's, like, embarrassed
by me or something like that?

1390
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:18,571
Probably. I'd hide you.

1391
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,444
How much do wedding rings cost?

1392
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:21,983
I mean, it really depends,
you know?

1393
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,077
I think you're supposed to spend,
like, three months' pay on a ring.

1394
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,213
That'll be easy.
I don't make any money.

1395
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,814
Really? I thought there was
lot of money in porn.

1396
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:31,723
God, it's not porn, okay?

1397
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:35,696
All we do is we show you
what nude scenes
are in what movies.

1398
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,198
Oh, like Mr. Skin?

1399
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:38,528
Who's Mr. Skin?

1400
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,398
Dude, Mr. Skin.

1401
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:42,568
Mr. Skin?

1402
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,235
JONAH: No!

1403
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,572
JONAH: We've wasted
14 months of our lives.

1404
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,169
This is exactly
the same as our site.

1405
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:51,508
How the fuck did this happen?

1406
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,845
Mr. Skin. That's even
a better name than ours!

1407
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,076
Fuck me in the beard.

1408
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:57,379
Dude, they got the top 10
group shower scenes!

1409
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,852
Why didn't you think
of that, Jay?

1410
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:00,354
Don't put this on me!

1411
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:01,515
God damn it!

1412
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:05,721
Well, shit, I saw it online
at one point, but I guess
I didn't connect the dots.

1413
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:06,988
What are we gonna do now?

1414
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:09,156
All we need to do is think
of a new, better idea

1415
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,927
that no one else
has thought of already.

1416
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:13,764
<i>Oh, dude, Spider-Man 3
starts in eight minutes.</i>

1417
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,202
JONAH: Don't worry, man.
We'll figure it out.

1418
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,578
You know what?

1419
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,673
I think just because
this site exists

1420
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,082
doesn't mean our site
won't work, necessarily.

1421
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,585
Good things come
in pairs, man, you know.

1422
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,019
Oh, for sure.

1423
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:36,752
<i>Volcano, Dante's Peak,
Deep Impact, Armageddon, right?</i>

1424
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,520
<i>Wyatt Earp, Tombstone.</i>

1425
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:41,188
Panda Express,
Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.

1426
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,925
Exactly. We can work together.

1427
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,194
This can help us,
if anything, I think.

1428
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:46,599
We're fine. We're golden.

1429
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:52,106
Look, Allison, I'm sure
this isn't how you pictured
it being, exactly,

1430
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,540
and it's not
how I wanted it to be,

1431
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:57,636
but that is why I'm presenting
you this empty box.

1432
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:59,578
It's a promise, Allison.

1433
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:02,311
It's a promise
that one day I will...

1434
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:06,821
I will fill this box
with a ring that you deserve,
a beautiful ring.

1435
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,481
And I can't afford it yet.

1436
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:12,960
I've picked it out already,
though, and it's at De Beers,
and it's really nice.

1437
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:17,465
So basically I'm asking you,
will you marry me?

1438
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,161
Because I'm in love with you.

1439
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,972
I love you, too.

1440
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,530
Really?

1441
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:27,838
Oh, man,
that's so nice to hear.

1442
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:31,778
That's the first time a girl's
ever said that to me, so...

1443
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,974
But here's the thing.

1444
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:36,484
There's a thing?

1445
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:40,522
I don't really know yet what
that love means, you know.

1446
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:44,683
Just 'cause it's so new,
and it's so exciting
that it's great.

1447
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,754
I don't know. We've only
known each other
17 weeks, so it's...

1448
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,264
Okay.

1449
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:53,302
Honestly, I mean, I thought...

1450
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:55,963
I thought you felt weird
that we're having a baby

1451
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,596
and we're not
engaged or anything.

1452
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:58,970
I'm gonna get off my knee.
Yeah.

1453
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,565
It's hurting a little bit.

1454
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:01,940
No, I'm okay with that.

1455
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,673
You know, we're just doing
what we can.

1456
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,840
We're making the best of it,
and I don't want us

1457
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,315
to put any more pressure
on ourselves
than we already have.

1458
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,977
Okay. Yeah.
That makes perfect sense.

1459
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:12,611
Are you okay? I don't want
to hurt your feelings.

1460
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:15,623
No, no, no.
Honestly, I just wanted
to do right by you, you know?

1461
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:18,558
So if you don't want to,
that's totally cool, you know?

1462
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:19,889
Okay.

1463
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,292
I really do love you.

1464
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,957
I know. Thanks.

1465
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:26,365
You mentioned that. It's nice.

1466
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,173
Ben proposed to me.

1467
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,707
What?
He did.

1468
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:41,181
It was really sweet.
I kind of feel
a little bit bad about it.

1469
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,582
He was, like, wearing
this great little button-down.

1470
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:47,349
He tucked his shirt in.
He got down on one knee.
It was so sweet.

1471
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:50,187
He didn't have
an actual ring, though.
It was just an empty box.

1472
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:53,251
But, you know,
he had this whole spiel
about when he has the money,

1473
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:56,525
he's gonna buy me
the ring that I deserve and...

1474
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,499
The box was just empty?

1475
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:00,729
I mean, he can't
afford a ring, so...

1476
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,931
So he got down on one knee
and gave you an empty box?

1477
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,405
Yes.

1478
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:06,998
(LAUGHING) I'm sorry.

1479
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,067
Get over it. It was sweet.

1480
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,738
I'm telling you,
if you'd been there,
you would have probably cried.

1481
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,748
You need to train him.
Huh?

1482
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,946
Oprah said that
when two people meet,

1483
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:22,081
they are forced
to point out each other's
differences and flaws.

1484
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,456
I thought you were supposed
to just accept people for who
they are, love them anyway.

1485
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,358
You criticize them a lot,

1486
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:30,627
and then they get
so down on themselves
that they're forced to change.

1487
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,291
Really? You don't think
that would just make it worse?

1488
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:33,527
That'd be, like, naggy.

1489
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:36,037
And then in the end,
they thank you for it.

1490
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:39,466
DEBBIE: You can't commit
to him. You can't make
a commitment to him.

1491
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:43,443
You don't even know him.
I don't even know Pete
after 10 years.

1492
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,741

JONAH: Hey, Marty.
MARTIN: Yeah.

1650
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:39,726
This is my friend, Alex.
She's a pretty
incredible person.

1651
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,820
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1652
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:45,260
Whoa, dude! Not cool, Martin.

1653
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:47,333
That's... That wasn't...

Howard Hughes?

1655
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:51,632
JODl: What happened?
MARTIN: Nothing.
Nothing happened.

1656
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:53,970
Come on.
Where were you?

1657
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,738
Look, I forgot
you were sleeping over.
I'm sorry, okay?

1658
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:59,747
Yeah, 'cause you're getting
high off your huge bong.

1659
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:00,941
How am I supposed
to be comfortable

1660
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:02,881
with the idea that you can
take care of me and the baby

1661
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,181
if you are always
getting high?

1662
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:06,619
You want me to stop smoking pot

1663
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,748
'cause there's an earthquake
once every 10 years?

1664
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:12,316
That makes no sense, Allison.
Look, you're being irrational.

1665
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:14,293
Just relax, okay?
We're all scared, you know?
You just...

01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,260
Oh, shit, the cops.

01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:21,198
California, eh?

1669
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:44,518
You know, it's times like this
I'm glad I don't own nice things.

1670
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:47,060
It's a big mess,
but there's only like
$50 worth of shit here.

1671
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,130
And that's kind of the good thing.

1672
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,462
You know, my dad told me,
"Don't move to Northridge."

1673
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,661
But you figure, like, what are
the chances of that happening
twice, you know?

1674
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:55,965
What is this?

1675
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,403
It's a ninja weapon.

1676
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:03,007
I hope this place
doesn't get condemned.
That would suck.

(PHONE RINGING)

1678
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,915
Hello?
Hey, it's me.

1679
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:46,954
<i>You!
Hi. So, listen.</i>

1680
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:48,713
Will you do me a big favor?

1681
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:50,554
Debbie wants us to come over
and have dinner tonight.

1682
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,355
She thinks Pete is cheating on her.

1683
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,191
<i>Really?
Yeah.</i>

1684
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,924
<i>Well, she saw
one of his emails and...</i>

1685
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:58,022
<i>Oh, man.
There's an address.</i>

1686
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,795
That sounds terrible.
I don't want to do that.

1687
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:01,494
Ben, come on.

1688
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:02,867
He's not cheating on her.

1689
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:04,633
<i>How do you know?
I just know.</i>

1690
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,106
<i>Are you sure?
I'm 100% sure
he's not cheating.</i>

1691
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:08,642
<i>Are you really?</i>

1692
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:10,304
No.

1693
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:12,074
It actually kind of makes sense
that he would cheat.

1694
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:13,239
Why?

1695
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:15,806
'Cause Debbie's a pain in the ass
and Pete's awesome.

1696
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:20,150
Why don't you just come over
then, and we'll just diffuse
the situation a little.

1697
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,553
I'm just saying the music industry
is different now.

1698
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:25,616
You can't...
Steely Dan would never
even have a chance.

1699
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:28,594
Well, maybe it's 'cause
Steely Dan gargles my balls.

1700
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:30,460
They're incredible.
BEN: They really
aren't good, man.

1701
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:31,692
Old Steely Dan.

1702
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:33,132
If I ever listen to Steely Dan,

1703
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,602
I want you to slice my head
off with an Al Jarreau LP.

1704

(LAUGHING)

1705
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:39,871
Oh, I should get going.

1706
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:42,536
I'm supposed to see this
band tonight in Hollywood.

1707
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:44,272
Actually, they're playing
in Laurel Canyon,

1708
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:47,371
so I'll call you 'cause
the reception's terrible
over there, so...

1709
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:48,575
Okay.

1710
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:51,278
And I don't want you to worry
'cause I know you worry.

1711
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:52,614
I'm just gonna jump
in the shower.

1712
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:55,656
It would be terrible if I smelled
worse than the band.

1713
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:58,157
Okay. Have fun.

1714
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,558
PETE: All right.

1715
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:05,261
You guys are crazy.
He's acting totally normal
and hilarious.

1716
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,244
She doesn't have a gun,
does she?

1717
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,306
No. I don't think so.

1718
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,163
Looks like no one's home.

1719
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:40,394
(WHISPERING)
Why was the door unlocked?

1720
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:41,868
Wait here.

1721
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:57,178
I kind of feel bad for Pete.

1722
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:58,480
What?

1723
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:00,778
This isn't a good way,
you know.

1724
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:04,155
If you're gonna
get caught cheating,
it shouldn't be like this.

1725
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:07,889
Well, maybe he should've
thought of that
before he was cheating.

1726
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:09,520
(LOUDLY) Pete!
Stop it.

1727
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:12,327
I coughed.
What do you want from me?

1728
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,699
There's nobody up there.

1729
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:15,930
Thank you.

1730
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:18,271
I guess I was wrong.

1731
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,432
(WHISPERING) I told you.

1732
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,738
Can we get out of here,
please?
Yeah, come on. Let's go.

1733
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:23,903
PETE: Suck it!
Did you hear that?

1734
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,344
What?
I didn't hear anything.

1735
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,926
Carlos Delgado.
Excellent choice.

1736
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:47,331
Too bad I got him
three rounds ago.
You're still on the clock.

1737
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:49,199
Oh, shit!
You gotta do something.

1738
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,000
We need a name.

1739
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:52,370
PETE: Hideki Matsui.

1740
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:54,739
CHARLIE: You just took
my whole outfield.
PETE: Sorry, Charlie.

1741
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:56,435
What is this?

1742
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:57,842
Debbie.

1743
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:00,108
What the fuck is this?

1744
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:01,979
It's our fantasy baseball draft.

1745
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,483
We said no wives.

1746
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:04,951
Your fantasy what?

1747
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:08,751
It's our draft
for fantasy baseball.

1748
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:11,087
I told you all about this.

1749
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:12,592
Got Matsui.

1750
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:16,689
Shit!

1751
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:20,558
Hey, Pete, don't let
the door hit you
in the vagina on the way out!

1752
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,797
MAN 1: Come on, who's going?
MAN 2: Prince,
you're on the clock.

1753
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,868
I should have told you.

1754
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:27,464
What else have you
been lying about?
Nothing...

1755
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:28,600
(CHUCKLING) That guy said,

1756
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:31,508
"Don't let the door hit you
in the vagina on the way out."

1757
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,241
Yeah, I heard him.

1758
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,873
That was hilarious.

1759
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:37,748
It's just that I know you've
been mad 'cause I've
been working so much,

1760
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,309
and I didn't want
to upset you.

1761
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:41,719
I wouldn't be mad.
I don't get mad.

1762
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:45,123
It's a fantasy baseball draft.
I'm not cheating or anything.

1763
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:47,058
No, this is worse.

1764
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:48,619
How is this worse?

1765
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:53,258
This is you wanting
to be with your friends
more than your family.

1766
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:56,668
Look, the reason I make
that up is because if I told
you what I was really doing,

1767
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:58,330
you would just get mad.

1768
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:03,309
So you think I'm seeing
a band, I do my fantasy draft,
and it's win-win.

1769
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:07,981
Well, what'd you do last
Wednesday night when you said
you went to see a band?

1770
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:09,345
I went to the movies.

1771
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,510
With who?
By myself.

1772
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,212
What'd you see?

1773
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:14,721
<i>Spider-Man 3.</i>

1774
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:17,452
Why do you want
to go by yourself?
Why didn't you ask me to go?

1775
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:18,993
Because I needed
to get away, you know.

1776
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:22,257
With work and you
and the kids, sometimes I just
need some time to myself.

1777
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:25,424
I need time for myself.
I want time for myself, too.

1778
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,434
You're not the only one.

1779
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,527
It's not that big of a deal.

1780
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:33,168
<i>(SOBBING) I like Spider-Man.</i>

1781
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:35,505
<i>Okay, so let's see
Spider-Man 3 next week.</i>

1782
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:38,101
I don't wanna go see it now.

1783
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:41,115
I don't wanna have
to ask you to ask me.

1784
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:44,380
I want you to just come up
with it on your own.

1785
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:47,114
I don't even know what to say.
What do you want me to do?

1786
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:52,456
You just think because
you don't yell that you're
not mean, but this is mean.

1787
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:55,359
I'm not being mean.
I'm being honest.

1788
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:56,795
You're telling me
I need to be honest.

1789
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,799
No, you're not. You're lying.

1790
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:02,769
I'm doing it because I need to
keep my sanity a little bit.

1791
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:08,006
You know what?
I don't want you
at the house anymore, okay?

1792
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:10,641
Come on.

1793
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:14,139
Shit, she's coming back.

1794
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:17,676
BEN: How come we go to
the gynecologist so often?

1795
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:21,950
I bet we have to go so much
so we can pay for that
$300,000 machine he has.

1796
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:27,393
I cannot stop thinking
about what an asshole Pete is.

1797
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,796
That's a little strong,
I would say.

1798
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:32,959
Really?

1799
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:37,061
'Cause that had to be
one of the most selfish things
I've ever witnessed.

1800
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:39,538
It's understandable,
I would say. I even think
it's kind of funny.

1801
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:40,768
(LAUGHS)

1802
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:42,537
What's funny about it?

1803
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:44,976
Well, you won't laugh now,
I wouldn't imagine,

1804
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:48,140
but, you know, the situation.

1805
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:50,411
We break into this stranger's house

1806
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:53,682
thinking we're gonna find him
sleeping with a woman,

1807
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:56,383
and it's a bunch of nerds
playing fantasy baseball.

1808
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:58,857
If you saw that, like,
on television, you would laugh.

1809
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:02,055
Is that what you think?
Is that what you wanna do, Ben?

1810
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:04,564
(LAUGHING) I don't even
like baseball.

1811
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:08,329
I'm just saying,
when you're a guy and,
you know, you have a family,

1812
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:10,894
you have responsibility,
you lose that male camaraderie.

1813
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:14,601
And I get that.
I totally understand
where he's coming from.

1814
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:16,108
Why do guys always go
to that place?

1815
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:18,270
"We miss male camaraderie."
Why do I give a shit?

1816
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:21,372
Go hang out with your bearded
freak friends. I don't care.

1817
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:24,577
You wanna hang out with guys
that look like the shoe
bomber, it's all on you, man.

1818
01:20:24,686 --> 01:20:26,244
What the fuck
am I supposed to say to that?

1819
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:27,412
You should just support me!

1820
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,922
You know, you should just
support everything I say

1821
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:32,585
because at this juncture in my life,
I'm allowed to be wrong!

1822
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:34,252
So if you're wrong,
I have to support it?
Yes!

1823
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:36,353
I can't tell you that
you're acting like a lunatic?

1824
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:37,796
No.
No? Okay.

1825
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:40,026
That's helpful.
You have to do nothing!

a lot of shit to do this!

sacrificed anything!
I have.

I've had to sacrifice my job,
my body, my youth, my vagina!

You've sacrificed your vagina?

Yes! It will never look
the same after this!

I'll pay for vaginal
reconstructive surgery.

You should just get out

in the middle of nowhere! No!

No.

about the baby books?

1871
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,375

of commitment, Ben!

1872
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:05,913
That you're not in this with me!

of commitment"? 'Cause
that's what it sounded like.

to do this together, okay?

to make it work

01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:24,678
What?

2137
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:26,276
She's the one. She loves me.

2138
01:35:26,353 --> 01:35:29,516
You can't believe
people love you?

2139
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:32,821
I love you, man!
Debbie loves you!

2140
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:34,520
I don't think I can accept her love.

2141
01:35:34,595 --> 01:35:35,857
There's something wrong with me.

2142
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:39,093
You can't accept love?

2143
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:40,360
I don't know what it is.

2144
01:35:40,434 --> 01:35:43,232
Love? The most beautiful,
shiny, warmy thing in the world?

2145
01:35:43,337 --> 01:35:44,429
You can't accept it?

2146
01:35:44,505 --> 01:35:46,234
I have to go to this other chair.

2147
01:35:48,175 --> 01:35:49,870
Oh, this is a better energy.

2148
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:53,175
You can't accept pure love?
You can't accept Debbie?

2149
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:55,442
She's chosen
to give you her life.

2150
01:35:55,549 --> 01:35:58,416
She's picked you
as her life partner!

2151
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:01,215
But you play fantasy baseball
because you can't accept her love?

2152
01:36:01,288 --> 01:36:02,312
(BURPS)

2153
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:03,447
(GROANS)

2154
01:36:03,524 --> 01:36:05,515
I could accept it, man.

2155
01:36:06,961 --> 01:36:08,258
And Debbie's amazing, man.

2156
01:36:08,362 --> 01:36:11,695
She's cool and she's funny
and she smells good

2157
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:14,792
and she's nice and her hair
always looks different.

2158
01:36:14,902 --> 01:36:16,267
She's too good for you, man.

2159
01:36:16,337 --> 01:36:18,430
Tastes like a rainbow.

2160
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:21,207
You're disgusting.
You know, you're an urchin.

2161
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:23,709
And she busts your balls
'cause you're a little bitch.

2162
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:27,145
You're a filthy bitch!
And I'd bust your balls.

2163
01:36:27,214 --> 01:36:28,340
(GROANS)

2164
01:36:28,415 --> 01:36:32,476
Debbie wants to give her life
to you, and Allison doesn't
want to do that with me.

2165
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:34,816
And it makes me sad all day.

2166
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:38,084
I want to go home.

2167
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:39,786
I wanna go home, too.

2168
01:36:42,763 --> 01:36:44,993
Everything looks beautiful.
Thanks.

2169
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:46,589
I went kind of overboard, huh?

2170
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:47,895
No. It's great.

2171
01:36:47,968 --> 01:36:50,801
Your daughter only turns eight once.

2172
01:36:50,905 --> 01:36:53,032
Is Ben gonna come?

2173
01:36:53,107 --> 01:36:55,837
I don't think so.
I don't know why he would.

2174
01:37:09,857 --> 01:37:11,848
Oh, hey. What up, dawg?

2175
01:37:11,959 --> 01:37:13,085
Where have you been?

2176
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,787
Around. You know?

2177
01:37:14,862 --> 01:37:16,625
Just kind of doing my thing.

2178
01:37:16,697 --> 01:37:18,562
Why is everybody
so mad at you?

2179
01:37:18,632 --> 01:37:20,463
I don't know. Are they mad?
What have they been saying?

2180
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:24,902
They've been saying, like,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
"Ben's a prick."

2181
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:25,996
They said that?

2182
01:37:26,073 --> 01:37:27,563
A lot.

2183
01:37:27,641 --> 01:37:28,869
That sucks.

2184
01:37:28,943 --> 01:37:30,638
What does it mean?

2185
01:37:31,478 --> 01:37:33,469
Penis. It means penis.

2186
01:37:33,547 --> 01:37:34,673
Oh.

2187
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:37,647
(CHUCKLING) Penis.

2188
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:41,980
Babe, we're running
low on plates.

2189
01:37:42,089 --> 01:37:43,420
Hey, Ben! What's up, man?

2190
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:44,957
What's happening, man?

2191
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:46,959
Hey, Ben.
Hey, Debbie.

2192
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:48,517
How are you?
Good. How are you?

2193
01:37:48,629 --> 01:37:49,789
Hi.

2194
01:37:50,798 --> 01:37:53,164
Did you just get pink cupcakes
or yellow cupcakes?

2195
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:54,666
I just got yellow cupcakes.

2196
01:37:54,735 --> 01:37:56,225
I thought I said
get pink cupcakes.

2197
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:58,828
I can run out.
I'll get some more.
Nah, it's no big deal.

2198
01:37:58,939 --> 01:38:00,338
I don't mind.
No, it doesn't matter.

2199
01:38:00,441 --> 01:38:02,170
You sure?
Yeah. You look
really cute in that.

2200
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:03,675
All right.

2201
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:08,641
Well, that was fast,
you pussy.
I'm a...

2202
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:14,484
You're the one that got
dressed up like a cholo on
Easter to come to this party.

2203
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:17,046
How are things
at Butt-Fucking-Ham Palace?

2204
01:38:17,157 --> 01:38:21,491
You look like Babe Ruth's
gay brother, Gabe Ruth.

2205
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:24,827
Well played, sir. That was good.

2206
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:25,957
You gonna talk to Allison?

2207
01:38:26,033 --> 01:38:27,660
Yeah, I was just about to.

2208
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:29,225
Right on.

2209
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:30,770
It's a doll.

2210
01:38:30,838 --> 01:38:32,305
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Thanks, Ben.

2211
01:38:35,042 --> 01:38:38,011
I just don't think
we can make it work.

2212
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:40,979
We can get back on track,
and everything's gonna be great.

2213
01:38:41,048 --> 01:38:43,846
You're just being nice,
and I'm being nice,

2214
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:48,048
and just because we're two
nice people doesn't mean
we should stay together.

2215
01:38:48,155 --> 01:38:52,251
I don't want this baby
to determine the rest
of our lives. You know?

2216
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:54,884
Me not wanting to do this alone
isn't enough of a reason

2217
01:38:54,995 --> 01:38:59,022
to drag you into a relationship
with me. It's just not fair.

2218
01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:04,230
And don't repeat this, but God,
I don't want to end up like Debbie.

2219
01:39:04,338 --> 01:39:05,498
But Debbie's happy.

2220
01:39:05,572 --> 01:39:07,699
Yeah, she's happy today.

2221
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:10,005
But every day is
a constant struggle for them

2222
01:39:10,077 --> 01:39:11,772
because they're not
right for each other.

2223
01:39:11,879 --> 01:39:14,780
You know? And they have
to force it, and I don't want
us to have to do that.

2224
01:39:14,882 --> 01:39:18,079
I don't want to force you
to be what I think you should be.

2225
01:39:18,185 --> 01:39:20,517
That's wrong of me
because you're great.

2226
01:39:20,587 --> 01:39:24,717
You really are. You're great
the way you are, and...

2227
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:28,922
I mean, you like to get high,
and you like to do shrooms in Vegas.

2228
01:39:29,029 --> 01:39:31,259
I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.
Who am I to stop you?

2229
01:39:31,365 --> 01:39:34,300
Who am I to tell you that
that's wrong? It's not wrong.
It's who you are.

2230
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:36,961
It's what you enjoy
and that's your life and...

2231
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:40,268
I'm not that guy anymore.

2232
01:39:40,374 --> 01:39:42,308
I mean, we can be friends.

2233
01:39:42,409 --> 01:39:46,243
And you can be there
when the baby is born,

2234
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:48,474
and in the baby's life
as much as you want.

2235
01:39:48,582 --> 01:39:50,413
I hope you will be.

2236
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:53,783
I just...
I think that if you just...

2237
01:39:53,887 --> 01:39:56,879
I don't know. If you give me a shot
to just show you that I'm...

2238
01:39:56,957 --> 01:39:58,151
DEBBIE: Excuse me?
Oh, shit.

2239
01:39:58,258 --> 01:39:59,384
Can you grab the video camera?

2240
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:02,395
<i>We're gonna sing
Happy Birthday now.
Yeah.</i>

2241
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:05,325
I'm sorry. I got to go.

2242
01:40:05,432 --> 01:40:06,490
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

2243
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:07,794
I'll be right back,
though, all right?

2244
01:40:07,901 --> 01:40:10,301
We'll finish talking.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, go.

2245
01:40:15,576 --> 01:40:16,668
What happened?

2246
01:40:16,744 --> 01:40:17,938
Thanks for warning me, man.

2247
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:20,913
I just walked into a fucking
buzz saw. She rejected me.

2248
01:40:20,981 --> 01:40:23,313
'Cause you,
for some insane reason,

2249
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:25,851
told Debbie that I did
mushrooms with you in Vegas!

2250
01:40:25,953 --> 01:40:27,079
She gets mad 'cause I smoke pot!

2251
01:40:27,154 --> 01:40:29,349
Now I'm upping it to fucking
psychedelics! Thanks!

2252
01:40:29,456 --> 01:40:31,253
Really? I thought she'd take you back.

2253
01:40:31,325 --> 01:40:33,225
You know why she just rejected me?

2254
01:40:33,293 --> 01:40:34,726
'Cause you're such a shitty husband,

2255
01:40:34,795 --> 01:40:38,094
she thinks I'm gonna turn
into a shitty husband.

2260
01:40:57,651 --> 01:40:58,777
Really?
Yeah.

01:40:58,852 --> 01:41:01,878
Wow, you're so big already.
Yeah.

01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:04,719
When is that baby popping out?
I got two months to go.

2263
01:41:04,825 --> 01:41:07,350
Really? Are you dilated yet?
I can tell.
Wow, wow!

2264
01:41:07,461 --> 01:41:11,557
You look fantastic.
You look... Are you gonna,

01:41:11,665 --> 01:41:14,065
Wow, you're about
to drop any second.

01:41:14,168 --> 01:41:15,362
You know what?
I love your broach.

2267
01:41:15,469 --> 01:41:17,801
You don't need to lie to me.
I don't appreciate it.

2268
01:41:17,871 --> 01:41:19,463
I know I look like a fat cow.

2269
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:21,508
And I'm sweating profusely.
I know that.
No, no.

2270
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:25,238
No, you don't look like
a fat cow at all. You look great.

2271
01:41:25,345 --> 01:41:27,210
So, I have to get going in.
They're calling me.

2272

Steve, hey. Help me out.
Give me an interview, please.

2273
01:41:29,483 --> 01:41:30,643

Just give me that.

No, Steve, don't be

Wow, you managed to turn

2279
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:44,697
No easy feat.
Shut up, Brent.

2280
01:41:45,165 --> 01:41:47,326
You screwed me, Dad, okay?

2281
01:41:47,401 --> 01:41:50,199
You said everything was gonna
be fine and nothing is fine.

2282
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:51,794
Nothing is fine.

giving me advice!

2285
01:41:57,544 --> 01:41:59,808

Allison, thank you
for coming in.

2299
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:49,450
I don't want to shock you
but we know what's under that jacket.

2300
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:52,451
You're pregnant,
have been for a while.

2301
01:43:52,526 --> 01:43:55,825
From my count, you're right
around eight months.

2302
01:43:55,929 --> 01:43:58,796
And I don't know why you felt
you couldn't tell us.

2303
01:43:58,865 --> 01:44:00,332
I'm really sorry.

2304
01:44:00,434 --> 01:44:02,994
This is Hollywood.
We don't like liars.

2305
01:44:03,103 --> 01:44:06,368
I just...
I wasn't expecting this and...

2306
01:44:06,473 --> 01:44:09,169
I didn't know how to handle it,
and I didn't want to lose my job.

2307
01:44:09,276 --> 01:44:11,642
I'm really sorry.
It's unfortunate.

2308
01:44:11,712 --> 01:44:14,476
It's unfortunate
you didn't tell us because

2309
01:44:15,515 --> 01:44:17,642
you would've found out
that we thought it's great.

2310
01:44:17,718 --> 01:44:19,049
Really?
Yeah.

2311
01:44:19,152 --> 01:44:21,677
So we did some research.

2312
01:44:21,788 --> 01:44:26,487
And turns out,
people like pregnant.

2313
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:27,652
Oh, my God!

2314
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:29,457
The bigger you are,
the bigger your numbers.

2315
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:30,553
(GASPS)

2316
01:44:30,631 --> 01:44:33,896
I was surprised
'cause I feel the opposite.

2317
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:40,873
<i>We're gonna do a whole maternity
month on E! Mommy.</i>

2318
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:44,570
You're gonna interview
all the pregnant celebs.

2319
01:44:44,678 --> 01:44:46,373
Really?
Yes.

2320
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:47,708
Scary!

2321
01:44:47,814 --> 01:44:52,080
You're pregnant, they're pregnant,
you can talk about being pregnant.

2322
01:44:52,185 --> 01:44:56,212
It just grosses me out when
I know that people are pregnant.

2323
01:44:56,323 --> 01:44:59,053
'Cause I think about the birth.
Everything's so wet.

2324
01:44:59,159 --> 01:45:01,753
And everything that goes into it.
None of the gross stuff.

2325
01:45:01,862 --> 01:45:06,094
But you know, hopes, dreams,
whatever, it's gonna be great.

2326
01:45:06,199 --> 01:45:08,394
Oh, my God.
This is such good news.

2327
01:45:08,502 --> 01:45:10,561
Thank you so much.
Yeah, you're welcome.

2328
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:14,232
And then,
after the baby is out...

2329
01:45:15,542 --> 01:45:17,533
JILL: Tight.
...tighten it back up.

2330
01:45:17,611 --> 01:45:19,511
And please don't
lie to us again.
Okay.

2331
01:45:19,579 --> 01:45:22,776
'Cause maybe someday
we could be friends.

2332
01:45:22,883 --> 01:45:25,181
Okay. I won't. I'm sorry.

2333
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:27,687
I just don't like secrets.
Okay.

2334
01:45:29,089 --> 01:45:31,216
You know, it's a rare thing
that you live to see the day

2335
01:45:31,291 --> 01:45:33,589
your wildest dreams come true.

2336
01:45:33,694 --> 01:45:37,027
I mean, what is there left to want?
I get to go to Legoland.

2337
01:45:37,097 --> 01:45:38,291
Shut up, Pete.
Say it!

2338
01:45:38,398 --> 01:45:39,729
Legoland!
Legoland!

2339
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,700
Legoland!

2340
01:45:41,768 --> 01:45:43,633
Don't get them all riled up
before the drive.

2341
01:45:43,737 --> 01:45:45,762
I shouldn't have given them
all that meth, then.

2342
01:45:45,872 --> 01:45:47,271
DEBBIE: We'll be back
on Sunday.

2343
01:45:47,374 --> 01:45:49,740
Or Saturday. You never know.
We might see it all in one day.

2344
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:51,573
Sunday. Let's go.

2345
01:45:51,712 --> 01:45:53,270
<i>Guess what? I'm scared
there's no one to trust.</i>

2346
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:55,610
<i>You can trust me.</i>

2347
01:45:55,716 --> 01:45:57,775
<i>You are gonna
fuck me over, aren't you?</i>

2348
01:45:57,884 --> 01:46:00,011
<i>Oh, for Christ's sake.</i>

2349
01:46:00,087 --> 01:46:01,645
<i>You are.</i>

2350
01:46:01,722 --> 01:46:06,216
<i>(GROANS)
Are you retarded? Or just brain-dead
from whiffing fumes out there in the swamp?</i>

2351
01:46:06,293 --> 01:46:09,990
<i>Ow, ow, ow.
That's what I am to you, isn't it?
Swamp trash, just like my mom.</i>

2352
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:13,461
(PHONE RINGING)

2353
01:46:15,635 --> 01:46:16,795
Hello?

2354
01:46:16,903 --> 01:46:19,133
Hey, what's up, Daddy?
What are you doing?

2355
01:46:19,239 --> 01:46:23,403
Just smoking a joint, drinking
some beers, you know. Rocking.

2356
01:46:24,077 --> 01:46:25,908
We're about to go
to a new club. You coming?

2357
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:28,573
No. I'm gonna pack
it in soon, I think.

2358
01:46:28,648 --> 01:46:30,309
What's he doing?

2359
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:31,612
He says he's gonna
call it a night.

2360
01:46:31,685 --> 01:46:33,653
<i>Dude, it's like 8:15, man.</i>

2361
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:36,780
Yeah, I know. I'm just tired.

2362
01:46:36,857 --> 01:46:38,916
Is he depressed?
You depressed?

2363
01:46:38,992 --> 01:46:40,687
No, I feel great. I like it.

2364
01:46:40,761 --> 01:46:42,228
He says no.

2365
01:46:42,295 --> 01:46:43,592
Ask him if he's
gonna kill himself.

2366
01:46:43,663 --> 01:46:45,028
You gonna kill yourself?

2367
01:46:45,098 --> 01:46:47,123
No, I'm not. Okay? Thank you.

2368
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:50,363
Tell him not to jerk off
with a noose around his neck.
It's dangerous.

2369
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:53,371
You shouldn't jerk off with
a noose around your neck
'cause it's dangerous.

2370
01:46:53,473 --> 01:46:54,940
Okay. Very good.

2371
01:46:55,008 --> 01:46:58,671
And tell him if he has to,
tell him he needs
a teammate or a spotter there.

2372
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:02,772
Right. And if you do,
you should have
a teammate or a spotter there.

2373
01:47:02,849 --> 01:47:03,975
Great.

2374
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:06,382
He says your mom's already there.

2375
01:47:06,453 --> 01:47:07,750
Uncool, man.

2376
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:15,327
(PHONE RINGING)

2377
01:47:15,395 --> 01:47:17,192
Okay, okay.

2378
01:47:17,297 --> 01:47:18,628
Okay.

2379
01:47:19,466 --> 01:47:20,626
Hi, Dr. Howard?

2380
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:22,725
No, this is Dr. Angelo.

2381
01:47:22,803 --> 01:47:23,861
How can I help you?

2382
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:26,131
I'm a patient of Dr. Howard's,

2383
01:47:26,206 --> 01:47:28,868
and I'm going into labor
and I need to speak with him.

2384
01:47:28,975 --> 01:47:30,670
<i>I actually don't know
where he is tonight.</i>

2385
01:47:30,744 --> 01:47:33,611
But I've made myself available
to his patients,

2386
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:35,170
and I'd be happy to help you.

2387
01:47:35,248 --> 01:47:37,580
Can you help me find him?
Can you give me his number?

2388
01:47:37,684 --> 01:47:39,879
<i>Oh, no. You know what? Actually,
I'm under strict instructions</i>

2389
01:47:39,986 --> 01:47:42,147
<i>not to give out his number,
but I can help you through this.</i>

2390
01:47:42,222 --> 01:47:43,587
No, no. No, no, no.

2391
01:47:43,690 --> 01:47:46,659
I want to speak to my own doctor.
You really won't give me his number?

2392
01:47:46,726 --> 01:47:50,218
Because this is my first baby,
and he promised that
he would be here for me

2393
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:52,890
and I need you to give me...
Give me his number, okay?

2394
01:47:52,999 --> 01:47:54,899
Dr. Howard's not available tonight.

2395
01:47:55,001 --> 01:47:57,492
But everything's gonna be okay,
I assure you.

2396
01:47:57,571 --> 01:48:01,598
No, I don't want you to help me
because I have no idea who you are!

2397
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:05,508
I want my own goddamn doctor!
You make sure he calls me!

2398
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:07,604
Oh, shit. Okay.

2399
01:48:09,516 --> 01:48:11,347
Oh, shit!

Hello?

2403
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:27,194
Ben, it's me. Can you come?
'Cause the baby's coming.
Can you come?

2404
01:48:27,267 --> 01:48:31,101
Oh, God. Allison.
I'm so happy you're calling.

2405
01:48:31,204 --> 01:48:33,764
I have so many thing's
I've been wanting to say to you.

2406
01:48:33,874 --> 01:48:36,365
I wanna apologize for things.
It's all I can think about.

2407
01:48:36,443 --> 01:48:37,933
No, listen. Wait. Listen.

2408
01:48:38,044 --> 01:48:40,308
I need you to come help me, okay?
Because the baby's coming.

2409
01:48:40,413 --> 01:48:41,539
So can you come help me?

2410
01:48:41,615 --> 01:48:43,640
Wait. The baby's coming
right now?
Yes. Right now.

2411
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:45,877
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2412
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:49,319
Is it happening? It's happening now?
Push. Push...

Breathe like this...
No, no, no, no.

2415
01:48:52,893 --> 01:48:55,657
You need to come now because
the contractions are happening,

2416
01:48:55,762 --> 01:48:59,061
and they really hurt
and the doctor isn't here,
and I can't get hold of him.

2417
01:48:59,132 --> 01:49:02,932
And he said he was gonna
be here, right? You were there
when he said that.

2418
01:49:03,003 --> 01:49:04,630
Okay, okay,
I'll come right now.

2419
01:49:04,738 --> 01:49:06,228
<i>Nobody's here.
I'm coming right now.</i>

2420
01:49:06,306 --> 01:49:08,240
...not anywhere,
I can't reach them, please.

2421
01:49:08,308 --> 01:49:09,798
Please, please hurry.
I'll just... So should I...

2422
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:10,968
I'll meet you
at the hospital, okay?

2423
01:49:11,077 --> 01:49:14,444
No! Don't meet me at the
hospital! No, no, I need you
to drive me. I can't drive.

2424
01:49:14,514 --> 01:49:16,243
<i>I can't drive like this.
No? You can't drive? Okay.</i>

2425
01:49:16,316 --> 01:49:17,943
I'll get gas
and then I'll pick you up.

2426
01:49:18,018 --> 01:49:19,849
<i>You have to get gas?
I need to just get cash.</i>

2427
01:49:19,953 --> 01:49:21,443
No. Don't get cash. Just come.

2428
01:49:21,521 --> 01:49:24,422
I need to get cash because
my car's on empty, I won't
even make it there.

01:49:24,491 --> 01:49:28,018
No, just come right now.
I'm not fucking around, okay?

2430
01:49:28,128 --> 01:49:29,755
This is serious and I'm alone.

2431
01:49:29,829 --> 01:49:33,026
It's the last thing you need to do is...
Just get here!

2432
01:49:33,133 --> 01:49:35,260
Look, if you keep yelling
at me, I'm never gonna get there.

2433
01:49:35,335 --> 01:49:37,064
You just need to calm down
for two... Okay.

2434
01:49:44,978 --> 01:49:47,970
Don't run out of gas.
Don't run out of gas. Come on!

01:49:52,986 --> 01:49:54,317

2436
01:49:54,554 --> 01:49:58,615

Ben?
Allison.

2440
01:50:13,573 --> 01:50:14,835
What is this,
like a water birth?

2441
01:50:14,908 --> 01:50:17,741
What are we doing? Should we go?
Should I... I have the...
Shh.

2442
01:50:17,844 --> 01:50:22,338
Just relax, okay?
Just be mellow, 'cause
that's what this is all about.

2443
01:50:22,415 --> 01:50:24,474
Because if it gets
too stressful in here,

2444
01:50:24,551 --> 01:50:26,985
then the baby is born
into a stressful environment,

2445
01:50:27,053 --> 01:50:31,217
and then he's wired for stress
for the rest of his life. So just...

2446
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:32,614
(EXHALES)

2447
01:50:32,726 --> 01:50:34,751
Just be calm.

2448
01:50:34,861 --> 01:50:36,021
Okay.

2449
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:40,393
(WHISPERING)
Okay, let's relax. Okay.

2450
01:50:41,568 --> 01:50:42,694
Do you want
to talk about things?

2451
01:50:42,769 --> 01:50:45,033
I feel really bad about, like,
a lot of the shit I did.

2452
01:50:45,105 --> 01:50:46,572
I can't believe
I said some of that.

2453
01:50:46,673 --> 01:50:47,935
That's all I think about
in my head.

2454
01:50:48,008 --> 01:50:49,339
I don't wanna talk about it.

2455
01:50:49,409 --> 01:50:53,004
But maybe we could bring
the baby into a reconciled
place so we can talk...

2456
01:50:53,079 --> 01:50:55,343
No. I don't wanna go there.

2457
01:50:55,415 --> 01:50:58,680
Don't go there. Okay?
Help me stay relaxed.

2458
01:50:58,752 --> 01:51:00,777
So, what should I do?

2459
01:51:00,854 --> 01:51:02,412
You need to call Dr. Howard.

2460
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:04,682
<i>WOMAN: Hello?</i>

2461
01:51:04,758 --> 01:51:09,752
Hello, yes, this is Ben Stone.
I'm calling on behalf of Allison Scott.

2462
01:51:09,863 --> 01:51:11,524
<i>We need Dr. Howard.
It's an emergency.</i>

2463
01:51:11,598 --> 01:51:14,192
Yeah. He's at San Francisco
at bar mitzvah.

2464
01:51:14,267 --> 01:51:17,634
He's at a bar mitzvah in San Francisco?
Do you know when he gets back?

2465
01:51:17,737 --> 01:51:19,261
<i>In three days.</i>

2466
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:22,435
Do you have his cell number,
by any chance?

2467
01:51:25,745 --> 01:51:28,873
Hey! Good news.

2468
01:51:28,948 --> 01:51:31,815
I got his number right here.
I'm gonna call him right now.

2469
01:51:31,918 --> 01:51:35,081
Oh, great. Thank you so much.
Oh, my God. I'm so glad
you're here. Thank you.

2470
01:51:35,155 --> 01:51:37,919
I'm glad I'm here, too.
Thank you.

2471
01:51:37,991 --> 01:51:39,720
I shouldn't have told you
you were a fucking lunatic.

2472
01:51:39,793 --> 01:51:42,125
I shouldn't have said that.
I feel terrible about it and...

2473
01:51:42,228 --> 01:51:45,061
No, it's okay.
We're past it. We're past it.

2474
01:51:45,131 --> 01:51:46,621
I'm sorry I told you
to fuck your bong.

2475
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:49,100
It's okay. I didn't.

2476
01:51:49,169 --> 01:51:52,161
Let's just drop it now.
We're over it.

2477
01:51:52,272 --> 01:51:55,400
I'm gonna call him right now.
You're doing so great.

2478
01:51:55,475 --> 01:51:59,571
<i>Hello, it's Dr. Howard.
I'm not here right now.
Please leave a message.</i>

2479
01:51:59,646 --> 01:52:03,275
Hey, Doc Howard.
Ben Stone calling.

2480
01:52:03,349 --> 01:52:05,283
Guess what the fuck's up?

2481
01:52:05,351 --> 01:52:08,320
Allison's going into labor
and you are not fucking here.

2482
01:52:08,421 --> 01:52:11,822
Now, where are you? You're at
a fucking bar mitzvah in San Francisco,

2483
01:52:11,925 --> 01:52:13,916
you motherfucking piece of shit!

2484
01:52:13,993 --> 01:52:15,290
And you know
what I'm gonna have to do now?

2485
01:52:15,361 --> 01:52:16,487
I'm gonna have to kill you.

2486
01:52:16,596 --> 01:52:18,996
I'm gonna have to
pop a fucking cap in your ass.

2487
01:52:19,099 --> 01:52:20,828
You're dead! You're Tupac!

2488
01:52:20,934 --> 01:52:22,925
You are fucking Biggie,
you piece of shit!

2489
01:52:23,002 --> 01:52:24,196
I hope you fucking die

2490
01:52:24,304 --> 01:52:27,467
or drop the fucking chair
and kill that fucking kid!

2491
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:30,008
Hope your plane crashes.
Peace, fucker!

2492
01:52:36,683 --> 01:52:37,945
Hey.
Hey.

2493
01:52:38,017 --> 01:52:39,109
Did you talk to him?

2494
01:52:39,185 --> 01:52:43,679
I didn't talk to him directly.
I left him a very nice message, though.

2495
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:46,452
And... Okay.

2496
01:52:46,526 --> 01:52:49,086
What I'm about to tell you
isn't that bad.

2497
01:52:49,162 --> 01:52:50,720
You should know that going in.

2498
01:52:50,797 --> 01:52:53,698
We can get through this,
and it's just a little hiccough,

2499
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:55,131
but everything will be fine. Okay?

2500
01:52:55,201 --> 01:52:57,533
Do you trust me when I say
everything will be fine?

2501
01:52:57,637 --> 01:53:00,037
I can deal with it.
Okay.

2502
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:03,871
So, Dr. Howard is at a bar mitzvah.

2503
01:53:03,977 --> 01:53:05,274
A bar mitzvah?

2504
01:53:05,345 --> 01:53:06,903
It's a Jewish rite of passage.

2505
01:53:07,013 --> 01:53:10,676
And he's gonna be there
for the next three days,

2506
01:53:10,750 --> 01:53:14,049
so he will not be able
to be here tonight.

2507
01:53:14,154 --> 01:53:15,416
Oh, no.

2508
01:53:17,423 --> 01:53:18,913
It's okay.

2509
01:53:20,026 --> 01:53:21,186
What do you think
we should do?

2510
01:53:21,261 --> 01:53:22,592
Okay. I know
exactly what to do.

2511
01:53:22,662 --> 01:53:25,392
All we do is we'll get in
the car, I'll drive to the hospital,

2512
01:53:25,498 --> 01:53:28,160
and on the way, we will call
every gynecologist we've met.

2513
01:53:28,234 --> 01:53:31,169
Someone will be available.
You know?

2514
01:53:31,237 --> 01:53:33,171
Okay. I can do that.
Okay. Good.

2515
01:53:33,239 --> 01:53:36,037
I mean, we still have time.
I mean, how far apart
are your contractions?

2516
01:53:36,109 --> 01:53:38,771
I think, like, seven minutes.
Seven minutes!

2517
01:53:38,878 --> 01:53:41,005
See? Not until four minutes
is it really coming.

2518
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:42,843
And has your water broken, even?

2519
01:53:42,916 --> 01:53:45,180
I don't know. I'm in the tub.

2520
01:53:45,251 --> 01:53:47,549
That's a good point.
Have you had your bloody show?

2521
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:48,848
What? What's that?

2522
01:53:48,922 --> 01:53:51,516
It's, it's... I mean, it's
a bloody mucusy discharge.

2523
01:53:51,591 --> 01:53:53,889
But it only comes out right before
the baby's gonna come,

2524
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:55,791
so if that hasn't happened,
we have time.

2525
01:53:55,895 --> 01:53:58,693
We can make it to the hospital.
It's no problem.

2526
01:53:58,765 --> 01:54:00,892
You read the baby books.

2527
01:54:00,967 --> 01:54:04,562
Yeah. I did. I read
three of them, actually.

2528
01:54:04,637 --> 01:54:06,628
Thank you.
You're welcome.

2529
01:54:06,706 --> 01:54:08,139
(GROANING)

2530
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:12,437
Hey. Hey, you okay?

2531
01:54:12,946 --> 01:54:14,675
(EXHALING)

2532
01:54:15,548 --> 01:54:16,742
Okay.

2533
01:54:18,251 --> 01:54:20,014
(ALLISON GROANING)

2534
01:54:21,588 --> 01:54:23,988
ALLISON: Wait.
Are we allowed to park here?

2535
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:27,821
It's okay. I stole this
from Martin's grandma.

2536
01:54:27,927 --> 01:54:30,828
Oh, that was really
sweet of you.
Thanks.

2537
01:54:32,332 --> 01:54:35,495
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

2538
01:54:35,602 --> 01:54:37,627
Okay. Inches away.

2539
01:54:37,737 --> 01:54:39,728
Okay.
We're close.

2540
01:54:39,806 --> 01:54:44,175
Home stretch. Hello.
This is Allison Scott.

2541
01:54:44,277 --> 01:54:46,302
Dr. Kuni said he would let you
know we were coming?

2542
01:54:46,412 --> 01:54:48,972
Oh, he did.
We'll take good care of you.
Okay.

2543
01:54:49,082 --> 01:54:50,242
Samuel?
Yeah?

2544
01:54:50,316 --> 01:54:53,683
This is Allison Scott.
Please admit her into Room 307.

2545
01:54:53,786 --> 01:54:54,844
Hi.

2546
01:54:54,921 --> 01:54:56,218
Hey.

2547
01:54:56,289 --> 01:54:57,813
You're our nurse?

2548
01:54:57,891 --> 01:55:00,951
That's why I'm holding
the clipboard.

2549
01:55:01,027 --> 01:55:04,428
So, what else is up
with you guys?

2550
01:55:04,497 --> 01:55:07,125
I'm just joking.
Let's have a baby, huh?

2551
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:08,360
Yeah.

2552
01:55:10,169 --> 01:55:13,104
Jeez, I'm sorry it took me so long
to find that vein.

2553
01:55:13,172 --> 01:55:17,165
That little guy really
didn't want me to find him.

2554
01:55:17,277 --> 01:55:19,142
Is that the baby
on that one right there?

2555
01:55:19,212 --> 01:55:20,270
Yeah.

2556
01:55:20,346 --> 01:55:22,610
So we can tell how the little
guy or gal is doing.

2557
01:55:22,682 --> 01:55:23,944
Okay.

2558
01:55:24,717 --> 01:55:28,278
Hello, Allison. Ben.
Interesting night.

2559
01:55:28,354 --> 01:55:30,345
We really, really appreciate
you coming, man.

2560
01:55:30,423 --> 01:55:34,359
What else do I have to do,
I mean, besides sleep? Totally kidding.

2561
01:55:34,427 --> 01:55:35,758
What happened to your doctor?

2562
01:55:35,828 --> 01:55:37,887
He's at a bar mitzvah
in San Francisco.

2563
01:55:37,964 --> 01:55:39,591
He didn't tell us, though.

2564
01:55:39,699 --> 01:55:40,859
Nice.
Yeah.

2565
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:44,426
Lucky for you, I don't have
any Jewish friends.

2566
01:55:44,537 --> 01:55:47,529
Dr. Kuni, I really wanna do this
naturally. I don't wanna use drugs.

2567
01:55:47,607 --> 01:55:51,202
Okay, let's just take a look
and see what happens, okay?

2568
01:55:51,277 --> 01:55:53,575
Foetal heart rate is good.
Samuel, where are we?

2569
01:55:53,646 --> 01:55:56,581
SAMUEL: Four centimeters.
Four centimeters what?

2570
01:55:56,649 --> 01:55:58,810
Dilated?
Dilated. That's right. Focus.

2571
01:55:58,918 --> 01:56:01,409
Pay attention, okay?
We're a team. Okay?

2572
01:56:03,089 --> 01:56:04,852
I wanna get
the fuck out of here.

2573
01:56:04,924 --> 01:56:06,016
What?

2574
01:56:06,092 --> 01:56:07,286
I just wanna get
the fuck out of here.

2575
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:09,123
Okay. Just relax,
man, just relax.

2576
01:56:09,228 --> 01:56:10,820
Oh, man, I don't fucking
like hospitals.

2577
01:56:10,897 --> 01:56:13,388
I know, but, Jonah,
this is beautiful.

2578
01:56:13,466 --> 01:56:18,768
I just think you need to relax
and embrace the beauty of
another life joining our gang.

2579
01:56:18,838 --> 01:56:21,306
We're having a baby.
We are having a baby.

2580
01:56:21,407 --> 01:56:24,137
I'm not having shit besides
a fucking panic attack.

2581
01:56:24,243 --> 01:56:28,509
There's probably a fucking room
back there full of dead bodies!

2582
01:56:28,614 --> 01:56:30,309
You guys wanna be here
when one rolls out

2583
01:56:30,416 --> 01:56:33,078
and just fucking coughs
malaria into our face?

2584
01:56:34,487 --> 01:56:35,784
Jesus.
Fucking shit.

2585
01:56:37,123 --> 01:56:39,648
BEN: Is that good?
ALLISON: Oh, yeah.

2586
01:56:39,759 --> 01:56:42,455
Oh, yeah, get in there.

2587
01:56:42,528 --> 01:56:43,620
I could do this all day.

2588
01:56:43,696 --> 01:56:44,822
Cool.

2589
01:56:44,897 --> 01:56:45,955
(BEEPING)

2590
01:56:46,032 --> 01:56:48,865
What was that?
What the hell was that?

2591
01:56:53,606 --> 01:56:55,870
What's happening?

2592
01:56:55,975 --> 01:56:58,102
Well, boys and girls,
what seems to be the problem?

2593
01:56:58,177 --> 01:57:00,111
Decels.
Oh, dear.

2594
01:57:00,179 --> 01:57:03,148
Okay, Allison, I need you to
turn on your back now, okay?

2595
01:57:03,216 --> 01:57:05,776
The baby's heart rate
is slowing. Okay?

2596
01:57:05,852 --> 01:57:07,479
It's gonna be okay.
Okay.

2597
01:57:07,553 --> 01:57:10,147
It's gonna be fine.
Is it gonna be fine?
It's gonna be fine. Okay?

2598
01:57:10,223 --> 01:57:14,455
You'll feel a little bit of
a push. You'll feel a little bit of...

2599
01:57:14,527 --> 01:57:16,495
Oh.
What are you doing?

2600
01:57:16,562 --> 01:57:20,726
I'm turning the baby so I can take
the pressure off the cord. Okay?

2601
01:57:20,833 --> 01:57:22,994
Oh, my God.

2602
01:57:23,069 --> 01:57:24,229
Okay, we're good.

2603
01:57:24,337 --> 01:57:26,237
The heartbeat's stronger,
but we're not out of the woods.

2604
01:57:26,339 --> 01:57:27,704
We need to get
things going now.

2605
01:57:27,807 --> 01:57:30,071
I think the cord is wrapped
around the neck.

2606
01:57:30,176 --> 01:57:33,043
So I'm gonna give you
some medicine, pop the bag
and get things going, okay?

2607
01:57:33,146 --> 01:57:34,977
I don't wanna leave the baby
in there for long,

2608
01:57:35,048 --> 01:57:36,538
and we can give you
some medicine for the pain.

2609
01:57:36,649 --> 01:57:38,173
ALLISON: No, no, no, no.

2610
01:57:38,251 --> 01:57:40,583
I don't... I don't want the baby to
be born all drugged out.

2611
01:57:40,653 --> 01:57:41,984
It's not my birth plan.

2612
01:57:42,055 --> 01:57:43,989
Now, things change.
We don't have time to debate this.

2613
01:57:44,057 --> 01:57:47,322
What? No. But no, I'm not
comfortable with that. I'm not.

2614
01:57:47,393 --> 01:57:49,258
No. Would you please
just listen to her?

2615
01:57:49,328 --> 01:57:51,421
Fine. Do what you want to do.

2616
01:57:51,497 --> 01:57:53,727
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
Should I leave?

2617
01:57:53,833 --> 01:57:56,495
Do you want to be the doctor?
Because I really don't need to be here.

2618
01:57:56,569 --> 01:57:59,197
No. What we want is to take
a second to talk
about our options, okay?

2619
01:57:59,272 --> 01:58:01,365
That's all we want.
No. You mean you want
to take a second

2620
01:58:01,441 --> 01:58:02,931
to tell me how to do my job.

2621
01:58:03,042 --> 01:58:06,011
My job is to get
that baby out safely.

2622
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:09,412
Or I can go home.
Just let me know. You be the doctor.

2623
01:58:09,515 --> 01:58:11,915
Can we talk outside
in the hall for a second?

2624
01:58:12,552 --> 01:58:14,110
That woman is a control freak,

2625
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:16,950
and she needs to let go
and let me do my job.

2626
01:58:17,056 --> 01:58:18,353
Look, she's just having
a hard time

2627
01:58:18,424 --> 01:58:21,188
because her and our doctor had
a very specific birth plan.

2628
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:23,785
And they wanted it to be
a very special experience.

2629
01:58:23,896 --> 01:58:26,729
If you want a special experience,
go to a Jimmy Buffett concert.

2630
01:58:26,799 --> 01:58:30,394
We have a new birth plan.
Get the baby out safely.

2631
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:35,533
Look, man, will you help us out?
I have no idea what I'm doing.

2632
01:58:35,608 --> 01:58:39,601
You can be as big a dick to me
as you want. Just be nice to her, man.

2633
01:58:39,712 --> 01:58:42,647
That's all I ask.
Just please be nice to her.

2635
01:58:48,888 --> 01:58:50,219
Are you okay?

2636
01:58:50,289 --> 01:58:52,154
I think so.

2637
01:58:52,225 --> 01:58:54,216
I'm sorry. Let's start fresh.

2638
01:58:54,293 --> 01:58:55,817
Thank you, man. Thanks.

2639
01:58:55,928 --> 01:58:59,227
This is healthy. This is good.
I think we're bonding.

(DOOR OPENING)

2641
01:59:06,939 --> 01:59:12,468
Allison, I apologize for being
a little brash, but if you're okay with it,

2642
01:59:12,578 --> 01:59:14,239
it's rather important
we break the bag

2643
01:59:14,313 --> 01:59:16,577
and give you some medicine
to speed things up.

2644
01:59:16,649 --> 01:59:20,585
Because once the bag is broken,
I don't want there to be an infection.

2645
01:59:20,653 --> 01:59:23,144
Whatever.
Do what you have to do.

2646
01:59:26,759 --> 01:59:30,354
Oh, my God.
What a nightmare that guy is.

2647
01:59:30,463 --> 01:59:32,761
I know, I know.
Look, I talked to him.

2648
01:59:32,832 --> 01:59:35,528
I think he'll be more cool now.

2649
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:40,503
I'm so sorry
I broke up with you.

2650
01:59:41,374 --> 01:59:43,035
You really don't need to be.

2651
01:59:43,142 --> 01:59:46,305
And, you know, I knew
you'd give me another shot.

2652
01:59:47,713 --> 01:59:50,807
I figured it'd be a lot sooner
than this, you know?

2653
01:59:50,883 --> 01:59:54,182
I was just in such
a panic from all of this.

2654
01:59:54,287 --> 01:59:58,553
And watching Debbie
and Pete together, it's...

2655
01:59:58,658 --> 02:00:00,717
And my ass got so fat.
No, no.

2656
02:00:00,826 --> 02:00:02,123
It did.

2657
02:00:02,195 --> 02:00:05,653
I just never, for one minute,
thought that the guy
who got me pregnant

2658
02:00:05,731 --> 02:00:08,529
would actually be
the right guy for me.

2659
02:00:09,035 --> 02:00:10,730
Me, either.
I guess he is.

2660
02:00:10,836 --> 02:00:11,894
Yeah.

I can't believe I go
out of town and this happens.

I'm sorry,

You want this over the shoulder?

You know, I can do whatever
you want. I can get in there.

Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you.
I've got it from here.

DEBBIE: Why?

2682
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:15,594
I'd like to be in there
with Allison, without you.

02:01:15,701 --> 02:01:17,032
Okay.

I understand how you feel
but this isn't up to you.

Look, Debbie, you are high
off your ass if you think
you're coming into that room.

If you take one step towards
that door, I will tell security

dress snatching up babies. Okay?

take care of her.

I want the epidural. Okay?

Okay? The cervix is fully dilated.

No, seriously,
I want an epidural!
I know there's time!

We can't give you
the epidural.
Take the time! I...

I'll make sure it doesn't come out!
I'll stop pushing.

this the all-natural way, okay?

take it down just a little.

only a hobby of mine,

crowning. Is that right, Deb?

2784
02:05:44,570 --> 02:05:46,697
You want out of the bet?
I want out of the bet.

2785
02:05:46,805 --> 02:05:51,799
You know what you have to say.
Just say it, man.
I think now is the time.

2786
02:05:51,877 --> 02:05:54,471
Jason, you're the master.

2787
02:05:54,547 --> 02:05:55,844
You heard it, right?
Yeah.

2788
02:05:55,915 --> 02:05:58,509
All right. You're out of the bet.
Yeah, now you're done.

2789
02:05:58,584 --> 02:06:00,415
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, God.

2790
02:06:00,519 --> 02:06:02,487
Your face smells
like an old man's balls.

2791
02:06:02,555 --> 02:06:04,352
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, fucking hell.

2792
02:06:06,258 --> 02:06:07,384
BEN: Hey.

2793
02:06:12,164 --> 02:06:14,223
Oh, my God.

2794
02:06:14,333 --> 02:06:16,233
Oh, hello.

2795
02:06:16,335 --> 02:06:18,326
Oh, my goodness.

2796
02:06:19,772 --> 02:06:21,603
She's beautiful.

2797
02:06:24,243 --> 02:06:25,835
Hello.

2798
02:06:25,911 --> 02:06:28,709
Oh. I love you, Ben.
I love you, Debbie.

2799
02:06:28,781 --> 02:06:32,512
We're gonna have another baby.
Okay.

2800
02:06:32,585 --> 02:06:33,916
Hello, baby.

2801
02:06:34,019 --> 02:06:36,010
Gentlemen, it's a girl!

2802
02:06:36,088 --> 02:06:38,022
(ALL CHEERING)

2803
02:06:40,292 --> 02:06:42,419
We got a daughter!
Mazel tov!

2804
02:06:42,528 --> 02:06:45,292
Congratulations, Daddy!
JAY: We got
a beautiful little girl!

2805
02:06:45,397 --> 02:06:48,389
Let's meet her! She's awesome!
JAY: A beautiful little girl!

2806
02:06:49,068 --> 02:06:52,231
And then your mommy said,
"Just do it, already,"

2807
02:06:53,105 --> 02:06:55,767
which was very confusing
to Daddy.

2808
02:06:55,874 --> 02:07:00,243
So I listened to the most
literal translation of that
and I just did it, already.

2809
02:07:00,312 --> 02:07:02,212
What would you do?

2810
02:07:02,281 --> 02:07:03,908
Don't tell Mommy,

2811
02:07:03,983 --> 02:07:08,215
but it was the smartest thing
I ever did, listening to her,
'cause now you're here.

2812
02:07:08,287 --> 02:07:11,017
Isn't that nice?
I think it is.

2813
02:07:16,929 --> 02:07:18,260
Hi, you.

2814
02:07:22,401 --> 02:07:24,562
I hope your apartment is big enough
for the three of us.

2815
02:07:24,637 --> 02:07:26,127
BEN: Oh, it definitely is.

2816
02:07:26,238 --> 02:07:29,105
That's why I got one in East LA,
the rent. It's huge!

2817
02:07:29,174 --> 02:07:30,471
The only thing is
we have to decide

2818
02:07:30,576 --> 02:07:32,942
if we're gonna be Crips
or Bloods before we get there.

2819
02:07:33,012 --> 02:07:35,480
Well, I look good in red.
I look good in blue.

2820
02:07:35,581 --> 02:07:36,878
The fighting continues.

2821
02:07:36,949 --> 02:07:38,280
(LAUGHING)

2822
02:07:38,350 --> 02:07:40,477
We could just throw off everyone
and become Latin Kings.

2823
02:07:40,586 --> 02:07:41,678
Yeah.

2824
02:07:41,787 --> 02:07:42,981
We both look good in gold.

2825
02:07:43,055 --> 02:07:44,386
(LAUGHING) Yeah.

2826
02:07:45,424 --> 02:07:46,686
Good choice.

2827
02:07:46,792 --> 02:07:50,319
(CARS HONKING)
I would yell at you about driving
so slow, except the baby's here.

2828
02:07:50,429 --> 02:07:53,865
No, these guys can honk all they want.
I ain't going faster than 12.

2829
02:07:53,966 --> 02:07:55,991
It might take us around three
hours to get home, though.

2830
02:07:56,068 --> 02:07:57,535
