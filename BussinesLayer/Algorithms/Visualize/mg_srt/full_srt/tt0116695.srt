1
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,480
The world. Six billion people...

2
00:00:47,584 --> 00:00:51,859
When I was a kid, there were three.
It's hard to keep up.

3
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:56,760
That's better.
That's America.

4
00:00:56,864 --> 00:01:01,453
America still sets
the tone for the world.

5
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:06,250
In Indiana, Clark Hodd.
The country's best point-guard.

6
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:10,837
Last week he scored 100 points
in a single game.

7
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:15,634
Erica Sorgi.
You'll see her ln the next Olympics.

8
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:22,413
In Seattle. Dallas Malloy, 16.
One of the premier women boxers.

9
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:25,958
She's thinking about her boyfriend
right now.

10
00:01:26,062 --> 00:01:32,424
Indio, California. Art Stallings.
Check out what pure joy looks like.

11
00:01:32,528 --> 00:01:36,594
Odessa, Texas.
The great Frank Cushman.

12
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:42,434
Next April, 26 teams will be falling
over themeselves to sign him.

13
00:01:42,642 --> 00:01:45,353
He's my most important client.

14
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,065
Start trying!

15
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:53,488
There's genius everywhere.
Some make it...

16
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:58,180
- You don't know diddley about golf!
- ...some don't.

17
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:02,768
I'm the guy you don't usually see.

18
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:06,313
I'm behlnd the scenes.
I'm the sports agent.

19
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:10,381
- I'm gonna hurt you this year.
- Hi, Jerry.

20
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:15,699
My door's always open if you want
to come and get a real agent.

21
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:20,183
I'm going to a meeting right now
to talk about you.

22
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:25,501
- We've got to win Super Bowls.
- Jerry, how are you doing?

23
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,715
- Who much is this gonna cost me?
- I know what you can afford.

24
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:34,052
I'll write it down for you.

25
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,326
- I can't afford that.
- Winning isn't cheap.

26
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,792
The new player and owner photo.
That's me on the left.

27
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:50,215
This is where I work. SMI.
Sports Management International.

28
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:59,599
33 agents guiding the careers
of 1,685 finely-tuned athletes.

29
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:07,211
I handle the lives of 72 clients
and get 264 phone calls a day.

30
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,738
I will not rest until you're holding
a coke in your own commercial, -

31
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:18,161
- broadcast during a Super Bowl
game that you're winning.

32
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:20,663
It's what I do best.

33
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:24,835
I started noticing
a few years ago...

34
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:30,361
In the quest for the big dollar,
little things were golng wrong.

35
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:36,305
There's no proof of anything.
This guy is a sensational athlete.

36
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:41,415
Are you Calvin Nack?
Can you sign my card?

37
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,647
I'm sorry, little fella, I can't.

38
00:03:45,378 --> 00:03:50,383
- Only Pro-Jam Blue Dot cards.
- I just wanted an autograph.

39
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:53,616
Lately, it's gotten worse.

40
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:01,958
Hi, baby.

41
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,711
Do you know your name?

42
00:04:10,404 --> 00:04:15,305
Wait, it's coming...
My name is Steve Remo.

43
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:20,623
I play for Chicago.
This lady here is my wife.

44
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:25,837
This is my boy. And this is...

45
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:31,989
Wait... My agent!

46
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:37,620
I've got to play this weekend, Doc.
I've got to play 65% of my games.

47
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:40,854
I've got to get the bonus.

48
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:45,441
- Okay, Jesse, take care.
- Mr. Maguire...

49
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,134
This is his fourth concussion.
Shouldn't he stop?

50
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:53,992
It would take a tank
to stop your dad.

51
00:04:54,201 --> 00:05:01,083
It would take all five
Super Trooper Warriors.

52
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,481
Right?

53
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,610
Right?

54
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:10,260
Fuck you!

55
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:17,454
Who had I become?
Just another shark in a suit?

56
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:39,353
Salaries are skyrocketing, and you
are one of the guys responsible.

57
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:49,155
Two days later, at our conference
in Miami, a breakthrough.

58
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:52,805
Breakdown?
Breakthrough.

59
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:56,559
- I just wanted an autograph.
- Fuck you.

60
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,190
I couldn't escape
one simple thought.

61
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:06,570
I hated myself.

62
00:06:06,778 --> 00:06:12,930
No, here's what it was...
I hated my place in the world.

63
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:23,358
I had so much to say,
and no one to listen.

64
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:27,217
And then it happened...

65
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:33,786
It was the oddest,
most unexpected thing...

66
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:38,791
I began writing
what they call a mission statement.

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,484
A suggestion
for the future of our company.

68
00:06:43,693 --> 00:06:50,157
A night like this doesn't come along
very often. I seized it.

69
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:54,225
What started out as one page,
became 25.

70
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:57,561
I was my father's son again.

71
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,045
Remembering the simple pleasures
of this job.

72
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:06,633
The way a stadium sounds
when a player performs well.

73
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:11,221
The way we're supposed
to help them in health and injury.

74
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,706
With so many clients,
we had forgotten what was important.

75
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,920
I wrote and wrote ...
and I'm not even a writer.

76
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:26,029
I was remembering my mentor
Dicky Fox, who said:

77
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:30,096
The key to this business
is personal relationships.

78
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:35,831
Suddenly, it was all clear.
The answer was fewer clients.

79
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:41,463
Less money. Caring for them
and caring for ourselves.

80
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:44,903
Just starting our lives... really!

81
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:50,013
I'll be the first to admit,
what I was writing was touchy-feely.

82
00:07:50,222 --> 00:07:56,478
I didn't care. It was the me
I'd always wanted to be.

83
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:03,882
I went out and
printed up 110 copies.

84
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,740
Even the cover looked like
the "Catcher in the Rye".

85
00:08:07,844 --> 00:08:12,641
I entitled it, "The Things
We Think and Do Not Say".

86
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:15,561
"The Future of Our Business"

87
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:21,922
That's how you become great, man.
Hang your balls out there.

88
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:25,050
Thanks.

89
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:28,700
Everybody got a copy.

90
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:33,184
Some of the animals out there
walk on two feet.

91
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:38,294
Society needs protection
from these warped minds.

92
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,978
Boom!

93
00:08:57,168 --> 00:09:01,339
This is Jerry Maguire.
Those manuscripts...

94
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:07,700
Oh, they did?
No, that's fine, thank you.

95
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:39,192
Finally, somebody said it.

96
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:43,885
Good work, Maguire.

97
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:05,678
I was 35, and I'd started my life.

98
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:10,997
- How long do you give him?
- About a week.

99
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,510
- Are you with the sports people?
- Jerry Maguire, SMI.

100
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:27,785
Bobbi Fallon, BPI.
I'm producing the Coke commercials.

101
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:29,975
Good luck.

102
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,440
My son is really allergic
to the blanket material...

103
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:39,882
That's all we have, okay?

104
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:48,641
- I'm sorry if I was rude just now.
- That's okay. We're both in it now.

105
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:55,628
Why is it so easy to talk to you?
Tell me about your fiancée.

106
00:10:56,357 --> 00:11:00,946
Honey, are you all right?
Do you want some juice?

107
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:06,472
Thank you.
We're out hiking.

108
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:12,312
I've got the ring in my pocket.
I'm a little nervous.

109
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:16,900
She says to me... Get this:
"Hurry up, klutz."

110
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:22,010
It bothered me somewhat.
I got quiet. Then she got quiet.

111
00:11:22,218 --> 00:11:28,579
I decide not to propose.
The mood isn't right.

112
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:33,897
But I know that she knows
that I was going to propose.

113
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:37,964
- So we check back into the hotel.
- How sad.

114
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:43,073
Little do I know, but my assistant
presumes I've now proposed.

115
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:49,122
She's got the lounge band to play
"Here Comes The Bride".

116
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:54,544
There's football players watching
and an ESPN crew.

117
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:58,194
So I turn to her and grandly say:

118
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:04,972
"Goddess of Rock Climbing,
would you marry a klutz?"

119
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:09,038
I took out the ring.
I don't much like big scenes, -

120
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:14,044
- but she said "yes"
right there ln the lobby.

121
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:17,276
The toughest men in football wept.

122
00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:24,576
- We're getting married in February.
- You'll stay married forever.

123
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:36,046
- What's wrong, Mom?
- First Class is what's wrong.

124
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:41,052
It used to be a better meal,
now it's a better life.

125
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,768
Ray?

126
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:53,774
Ray! Come on, buddy.

127
00:12:53,878 --> 00:12:59,196
- Ray!
- Excuse me, can I help you?

128
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:02,533
Jerry Maguire.

129
00:13:02,637 --> 00:13:08,686
- I work in your office.
- You're Dorothy Boyd in accounts.

130
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:14,004
By your desk is a photo of Einstein
with Shaquille O'Neal's body.

131
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:19,948
- That's pretty good.
- What did you lose here?

132
00:13:20,156 --> 00:13:23,701
My son... My mind.
Ray!

133
00:13:27,143 --> 00:13:34,129
Dorothy, while I go look for him,
you grab this gentleman here.

134
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:44,453
You scared me!

135
00:13:44,661 --> 00:13:48,103
- Don't do that again, ever!
- Okay, Mommy.

136
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:51,544
Ever, ever... ever!

137
00:13:51,648 --> 00:13:57,383
- Dorothy... take care.
- Thank you so much.

138
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:02,493
I loved your memo, by the way.

139
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:06,455
- You did?
- Yeah.

140
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,171
Thanks. Actually,
it was just a mission statement.

141
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:20,012
In this age, optimism like that
is a revolutionary act.

142
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:25,122
I appreciate that.
I didn't know if I should write it.

143
00:14:25,226 --> 00:14:29,709
It was two in the morning,
and some of the stuff I just...

144
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:34,714
That part about
"embracing with enthusiasm...

145
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:42,014
...and forcing commerce to give
a little back for the greater good."

146
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:48,375
I was inspired,
and I'm an accountant.

147
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:52,442
I mean, to respect yourself enough
to say it out loud.

148
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,717
To put yourself out there like that,
so nakedly.

149
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:02,139
I don't know... It got me.

150
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:11,525
- Is this bothering you?
- No, this is... great.

151
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:14,340
It's great.

152
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:18,824
Do you need a ride?
Do you need a lift?

153
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,351
Oh, no! I'm sure
that would just make your day.

154
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,044
Driving us out to Manhattan Beach.
All those tiny streets.

155
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:34,258
Playing chicken with the traffic.
Your life flashing before you.

156
00:15:34,362 --> 00:15:39,366
- I've had too much coffee.
- It's no problem.

157
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:44,476
There's my sister Laurel,
to pick us up.

158
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:52,297
Ray... Dorothy... a pleasure.

159
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:55,008
Bye.

160
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:06,479
Hi, Ray. Hi, you.
I'm double parked, let's go.

161
00:16:06,688 --> 00:16:09,712
Is this everything?

162
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:17,741
Whoever snagged him
must be some classy babe.

163
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:18,158
Whoever snagged him
must be some classy babe.

164
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:25,145
Don't ever stop fucking me!

165
00:16:25,353 --> 00:16:29,732
Sooner or later
we'll have to stop!

166
00:16:29,837 --> 00:16:33,487
Never been better...
Never!

167
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:35,886
Never better!

168
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:46,939
Open your eyes. If you want it,
I'd go with another woman for you.

169
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:51,005
I'm not interested in it, anymore.

170
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:54,551
It was a phase. A college thing.

171
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:58,096
Like torn Levis
or law school for you.

172
00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:02,372
Want some fruit from the kitchen?

173
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:13,634
- Do you have to tell me everything?
- That's what intimacy is.

174
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:20,307
- We're eating out tomorrow night.
- I know about the bachelor party.

175
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:26,564
Your buddies worked hard for this.
The guys from the office are coming.

176
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:32,716
Relax, act surprised,
and have an amazing time.

177
00:17:53,885 --> 00:17:58,578
Hey, old college-buddy.
Congratulations.

178
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:01,706
- For you.
- Thank you.

179
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:07,649
And this. The finest cigar
my club has to offer.

180
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:13,907
This is what it's all about, man.
Everybody loves you.

181
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:17,348
It pisses me off!

182
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:21,519
Whether you're country,
a red-neck or a freak...

183
00:18:21,728 --> 00:18:25,794
Young or old,
from Moscow, London or Memphis...

184
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:31,008
Jerry Maguire will still be
the king of rock and roll.

185
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:36,639
- Your little black book.
- He makes my heart pound.

186
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:40,914
- I know Jerry pretty well.
- Hi, Jerry, remember me?

187
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:45,189
- I'll see you for lunch tomorrow.
- He was good in bed.

188
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:48,735
This is the funniest thing ever.

189
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,323
Jerry should get married.
He won't be alone.

190
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:57,286
- He cannot be alone.
- He can't be alone.

191
00:18:57,494 --> 00:19:02,604
Jerry is great at friendship,
but he's really bad at intimacy.

192
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:05,419
He can't be alone.

193
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:10,738
- He can't say, "I love you".
- He's an agent. He lies.

194
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:17,308
- I love you too.
- Hey, love you too.

195
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:19,809
I love you.

196
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:26,275
- I love you.
- I love you.

197
00:19:38,162 --> 00:19:42,751
- Good morning, Jenny.
- Sorry I missed the party.

198
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:48,069
Good morning, Jerry.
Marcee's here and she's in a hurry.

199
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,804
I'm glad to see you finally made it.
Rod is very upset.

200
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:56,515
- Tyson, no!
- Okay.

201
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:59,957
- Hello.
- Long time no see!

202
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,815
- Tyson!
- How can I make your life better?

203
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,029
Jerry, I don't want any bullshit.
Where is our offer from Arizona?

204
00:20:09,237 --> 00:20:14,347
- Cronin's for lunch?
- This is Bob Sugar.

205
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:19,353
- He's called at our house.
- Sorry to interrupt you.

206
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:24,462
You've got to earn your 4%.
My husband has an image.

207
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:29,572
Putting him in a water-bed
commercial makes him common.

208
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,577
He deserves the big four: Shoe,
car, clothing line, soft drink.

209
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:38,644
I know about celebrity endorsement.

210
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:43,128
We both majored in marketing.
We came to play!

211
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:46,569
The dirtyman is back!

212
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:52,200
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

213
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:58,457
Are you okay?

214
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:03,984
- Fine. What's up?
- I came here to let you go.

215
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:09,510
- Pardon me?
- I came here to fire you, Jerry.

216
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:17,435
It's real. You should say something.

217
00:21:23,587 --> 00:21:26,716
Shit.

218
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:32,869
A crowded restaurant...
so there won't be a scene.

219
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:44,964
You ungrateful...

220
00:21:45,068 --> 00:21:49,657
You did this to yourself.
You said fewer clients.

221
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:53,306
How do you think it feels
firing you?

222
00:21:53,515 --> 00:21:58,833
I've thought about it all week.
Get past yourself for a second!

223
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:02,171
- You'll lose.
- You wanted smaller.

224
00:22:02,379 --> 00:22:07,280
Well, now I want all my clients,
and yours, too.

225
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:28,553
Wendy, bring me my numbers.

226
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:46,175
- Cush.
- This is Sugar.

227
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:51,702
Look, you're the most important guy
in sports. How does it feel?

228
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,978
I just want to play football.
Dad, it's one of the agents.

229
00:22:56,186 --> 00:23:02,130
Wendy! Keep trying Cushman.
And please, bring me my numbers.

230
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:06,301
J.J., what's up?
Have you talked to Maguire?

231
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:10,994
He had a meltdown.
I've talked to Doritos about you.

232
00:23:11,202 --> 00:23:15,060
They're very interested.
Here, talk to Rick.

233
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:21,735
Carlo, you pay 25% of your
endorsements to SMI. I'll take 18%.

234
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,801
I don't know if it was drugs,
but the guy freaked out.

235
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:29,868
He's not the guy for you.
How's your mom?

236
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:33,205
I'm gonna make this easy for you.

237
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:39,774
What does your heart tell you?
I'm sorry to hear that.

238
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:49,889
- What's going on?
- They've fired Jerry Maguire.

239
00:23:58,544 --> 00:24:01,464
That's a mistake.

240
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:05,739
I'm concerned about your family
and your future.

241
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:09,180
I go back a long way with SMI.

242
00:24:09,388 --> 00:24:12,205
Is Maguire black?

243
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:17,314
Bob Sugar?
He's... entertaining, funny...

244
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:20,860
I'm Mr. Black People!

245
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:24,405
Don't make this harder than it is.

246
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:28,681
I've got to be honest,
this is very distressing for me.

247
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:34,103
Remember that stripper
at Laguna Beach? Her name was April.

248
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:38,796
I remember things.
It's not the money. I do it for you.

249
00:24:39,004 --> 00:24:43,383
- I'm still holding for Katarina.
- I'm talking big money.

250
00:24:43,592 --> 00:24:46,094
Great!

251
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:50,683
Are you in or out?
This is business not friendship.

252
00:24:50,787 --> 00:24:54,436
You are in... that's good.

253
00:24:54,646 --> 00:24:57,983
I want to cry
for what they did to you.

254
00:24:58,191 --> 00:25:03,509
If it wasn't for the Acura deal,
you know I'd go with you.

255
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:09,140
Jerry. Oh, God!

256
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:14,146
Call waiting.
Who could be calling me now?

257
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,212
- Hi, Kathy Sanders.
- Still me, Kathy.

258
00:25:20,298 --> 00:25:26,033
Kathy, why are you crying?
Oh... so you're in.

259
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:29,266
Rod, it's Jerry Maguire.

260
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:32,707
Jerry Maguire! How am I doing?

261
00:25:32,915 --> 00:25:37,191
I'll tell you. I'm sweating.
Where's my contract?

262
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,153
Bob Sugar says
I'm missing out being with you.

263
00:25:41,362 --> 00:25:45,533
- You hear what I'm saying?
- That's why I called.

264
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:50,017
No, no... Do you truly
hear what I'm saying?

265
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:54,709
- I hear you, Dad.
- We have to get together.

266
00:25:54,918 --> 00:25:59,819
- Hold on a minute, Rod.
- Personal attention.

267
00:25:59,923 --> 00:26:06,285
- That's what you told my wife.
- That's what I said.

268
00:26:06,493 --> 00:26:11,603
Good! We're just getting started
on the things you need to know.

269
00:26:11,707 --> 00:26:14,523
I will kill for you.

270
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:20,466
I am a valuable commodity. There's
dudes out there trying to kill me.

271
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:26,514
I still catch the ball. Touchdown!
I make miracles happen.

272
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,704
Are you in?

273
00:26:28,912 --> 00:26:32,458
I'm from Arizona.
I broke Arizona records.

274
00:26:32,562 --> 00:26:35,899
I went to Arizona State!

275
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:39,862
- And now you want Arizona dollars.
- Exactly.

276
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:44,658
I'm sitting here
with an ant problem.

277
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:50,498
My brother Tee Pee's room
is flooded.

278
00:26:50,602 --> 00:26:53,939
- Say hello to Jerry Maguire.
- Hello.

279
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:57,172
Hello, Tee Pee.

280
00:26:57,276 --> 00:27:04,575
No one's looking out for me.
I'm supposed to be a superstar.

281
00:27:04,785 --> 00:27:11,145
- Are you in or out?
- You stay with Bob Sugar!

282
00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:15,838
I am a role model.
I have a family to support!

283
00:27:16,046 --> 00:27:19,070
I want a contract in Arizona.

284
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,094
I like you.

285
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:26,370
My wife likes you.
You're good to my wife.

286
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,811
- I will stay with you.
- That's great.

287
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:34,608
That's what I'm gonna do for you.
God bless you, Jerry.

288
00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:38,674
This is what you're gonna do for me.

289
00:27:38,882 --> 00:27:42,637
What can I do for you?
You just tell me.

290
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:48,476
It's personal and very important.
Hell! It's a family motto.

291
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:52,438
- Are you ready, Jerry?
- I'm ready.

292
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:55,672
Here it is.

293
00:27:56,506 --> 00:27:59,634
Show me the money.

294
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:01,824
Show...

295
00:28:02,032 --> 00:28:05,787
...me ...the...

296
00:28:05,995 --> 00:28:08,498
...money... !

297
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:14,859
- Say it with me, Jerry.
- Show you the money.

298
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:18,300
No, you can do better than that.

299
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:22,575
- Bob Sugar's on the other line.
- Show you the money.

300
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:26,120
- No, show me the money.
- Show me the money.

301
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,457
- Louder!
- Show me the money.

302
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:35,297
- You've got to yell that shit!
- Show me the money!

303
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:39,364
- Louder, Jerry.
- Show me the moneyl

304
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:43,223
Show me the money!

305
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:48,541
- You love this black man.
- I love the black man!

306
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:53,650
- I love black people.
- I love black people.

307
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:59,281
Show me the money!

308
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:03,452
Congratulations,
you're still my agent.

309
00:29:33,485 --> 00:29:38,907
Well... don't worry.

310
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:44,016
I'm not gonna do
what you think I'm gonna do.

311
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:51,941
Let me just say...

312
00:29:52,046 --> 00:29:56,946
...as I ease out of the office
I helped build...

313
00:29:57,155 --> 00:30:04,037
I'm sorry, but it's a fact that
there's such a thing... as manners.

314
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:09,147
A way of treating people.

315
00:30:10,712 --> 00:30:15,820
These fish have manners.

316
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:22,495
In fact, I'm starting a new company
and the fish will come with me.

317
00:30:22,703 --> 00:30:28,438
Call me sentimental,
but the fish are coming with me.

318
00:30:39,074 --> 00:30:42,307
Okay.

319
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:48,147
If anybody else
wants to come with me, -

320
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:54,612
- this is a chance for something
real, and fun, and inspiring -

321
00:30:54,716 --> 00:31:00,660
- in this godforsaken business,
and we will do it together.

322
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:08,168
Who's coming with me?

323
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:11,714
Who's coming with me?

324
00:31:14,112 --> 00:31:17,866
Who's coming with me
besides Flipper here?

325
00:31:24,331 --> 00:31:28,398
This is embarrassing.

326
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:37,157
All right.
Wendy, shall we?

327
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:41,954
I'm three months away
from the pay increase...

328
00:31:47,794 --> 00:31:51,652
Okay.

329
00:31:59,055 --> 00:32:04,478
- I will go with you.
- Dorothy Boyd, thank you.

330
00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:15,741
Right now?

331
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:20,850
Don't do it.

332
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:27,732
Bye.

333
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:39,620
We'll see you all again.
Sleep tight.

334
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:45,459
Let's see how they do without us.

335
00:32:56,825 --> 00:33:00,475
Thank you.

336
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,793
- You will have a medical program?
- Oh, sure.

337
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:10,590
I don't know...

338
00:33:10,694 --> 00:33:16,012
Don't panic.
We're gonna be okay.

339
00:33:16,117 --> 00:33:21,643
We're gonna be great.
We're gonna be... great.

340
00:33:53,762 --> 00:33:58,975
- I wonder what he said.
- My aunt is hearing impaired.

341
00:33:59,184 --> 00:34:04,084
He just said,
"You complete me".

342
00:34:23,585 --> 00:34:30,154
To support one another,
we've got to listen to one another.

343
00:34:30,258 --> 00:34:35,993
Women are taught not to see
each other as good people.

344
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:40,477
We see each other as enemies.
We compete over men.

345
00:34:40,686 --> 00:34:45,691
- It's true, It's terrible.
- I used to hate women.

346
00:34:45,796 --> 00:34:50,071
Now I've met you guys,
and you're like me.

347
00:34:50,176 --> 00:34:54,138
It's important
because you can be my friends.

348
00:34:54,346 --> 00:34:57,788
- What about medical?
- Of course.

349
00:34:57,892 --> 00:35:01,020
Single parents can't be frivolous.

350
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:05,922
If you had read what he wrote,
you'd have left, too.

351
00:35:06,026 --> 00:35:12,282
Do you know those child exams
cost $150, and that's if he's well.

352
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:16,245
- Where is Ray?
- Asleep in the living room.

353
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:23,127
Don't leave my little boy alone
with your divorced women's group.

354
00:35:23,335 --> 00:35:27,820
I've finally got in touch
with my anger.

355
00:35:36,474 --> 00:35:39,811
What did I do?

356
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:44,087
Function, function...
Forward motion is everything.

357
00:35:44,295 --> 00:35:46,798
Cush saves all.

358
00:35:46,798 --> 00:35:51,178
Go to Texas. Keep one star,
and they'll all follow.

359
00:35:51,387 --> 00:35:56,496
There's no real loyalty.
You told me that yourself.

360
00:35:56,705 --> 00:36:00,667
- I was trying to sleep with you.
- Well, it worked.

361
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:06,716
I will not let you fail.
You are Jerry Maguire!

362
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,886
King of the house calls.
Master of the living room.

363
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:15,892
- Okay, this is working.
- You are not a loser.

364
00:36:18,499 --> 00:36:24,651
- Who mentioned losing?
- Wrong word! When can you leave?

365
00:36:52,285 --> 00:36:57,082
- Matt?
- I'm in the back, Jerry.

366
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:00,418
Would you like a bloody beer?

367
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:05,007
- Beer and tomato juice.
- I'm fine.

368
00:37:05,215 --> 00:37:10,534
We've spent a lot of time together,
and you know I care about your son.

369
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:14,704
I'm concerned
that if you stay with SMI...

370
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:18,771
We've decided to stay with you.

371
00:37:23,985 --> 00:37:29,825
I'm not really a hugger.
I can't let go.

372
00:37:30,033 --> 00:37:35,664
I told myself if he shows up,
we stick with him.

373
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:40,148
- Hey, Jerry. How's it going?
- Hey, Cush.

374
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:45,049
- How are you?
- You remember Keith.

375
00:37:45,258 --> 00:37:49,950
He must go number one in the draft,
and I want him to play.

376
00:37:50,054 --> 00:37:53,600
It'll either be Denver or San Diego.

377
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:59,856
- I'll either surf or ski.
- Denver's where he should be.

378
00:38:00,065 --> 00:38:06,635
You know I don't do contracts,
but what you do have ls my word.

379
00:38:06,739 --> 00:38:11,014
And it's stronger than oak.

380
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:03,153
- Hello.
- Jerry Maguire.

381
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:08,054
- Is Avery there?
- She has an NFL meeting in Atlanta.

382
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:17,439
- Hello?
- My son's here with the nanny.

383
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:22,444
- In our office?
- Nanny? I prefer child technician.

384
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:30,161
- I came home to work here.
- Fine. Dorothy, we are backl

385
00:39:30,265 --> 00:39:35,896
We are so very, very back.
I resigned Cush. We're set.

386
00:39:36,104 --> 00:39:40,797
- I am so happy for you.
- Happy for us.

387
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:43,091
Happy for us.

388
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:50,391
Rod, being at the draft will help.
Get on the plane and meet us there.

389
00:39:50,495 --> 00:39:53,623
Good. See you there.

390
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:57,377
Avery will be at the B-gate at 4:15.

391
00:39:57,481 --> 00:40:02,174
Do you know the human head
weighs eight pounds?

392
00:40:02,382 --> 00:40:08,431
Troy Aikman, in only six years,
has passed for 16,303 yards.

393
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:16,356
- Bees and dogs can smell fear.
- I've booked Tidwell at the Mariot.

394
00:40:16,565 --> 00:40:22,300
Pete Rose made 4,256 hits and
he's not in the Hall of Fame.

395
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:27,827
Did you know that my neighbour
has three rabbits?

396
00:40:28,035 --> 00:40:31,789
I can't compete with that.

397
00:40:31,893 --> 00:40:35,022
- Did we go over everything?
- Yep.

398
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:39,505
- Back on Tuesday, right?
- Yeah.

399
00:40:40,757 --> 00:40:45,345
- Ray, wish me luck.
- Good luck!

400
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:09,330
- Hey, Rod, you made it.
- Jerry...

401
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:16,524
- Hi, Cush.
- We should be selling these.

402
00:41:16,628 --> 00:41:21,842
This is my agent, you might
want to get his autograph.

403
00:41:22,051 --> 00:41:26,326
- Excuse me...
- Are you Hootie?

404
00:41:26,535 --> 00:41:31,957
No, I'm not Hootie.

405
00:41:36,337 --> 00:41:39,778
Is it gonna be San Diego or Denver?

406
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:49,476
He'll either surf or ski.

407
00:41:55,316 --> 00:41:59,486
Rod, at last I find you.

408
00:41:59,695 --> 00:42:03,762
What am I doing here, Jerry?
This ain't my party.

409
00:42:03,866 --> 00:42:09,184
- Nobody gives a damn about me.
- Let's walk through the lobby.

410
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:14,711
I want the media and the reps
to see you for what you are:

411
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,195
The best-kept secret in the NFL.

412
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:24,201
You are the wide - receiver.
You're fast, fierce and charismatic.

413
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:27,225
You are the man! Ready?

414
00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:34,420
Let's go. The fiercest.
You are the man.

415
00:42:34,629 --> 00:42:39,320
- Let's do it.
- Hi, Mel. Hi, Tom.

416
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:44,847
It's a good thing you were able
to hold onto Cushman.

417
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:50,479
I want you to meet Rod Tidwell,
110 catches, 1,550 yards last year.

418
00:43:24,473 --> 00:43:28,853
I came all that way
just to walk the lobby.

419
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:34,692
- It might have even worked, too.
- Yeah? Let's do it again.

420
00:43:36,152 --> 00:43:41,470
See the Reebok-ad down there.
Where are my endorsements?

421
00:43:41,575 --> 00:43:46,163
No love from Chevy,
no love from Pepsi...

422
00:43:46,372 --> 00:43:50,021
I ain't gettin' no love from Nike.

423
00:43:50,229 --> 00:43:54,505
Did I ever tell you
about my Reebok story?

424
00:43:54,714 --> 00:43:59,928
- I've got to get back to Cushman.
- Oh, your golden paycheck.

425
00:44:00,136 --> 00:44:04,620
I'll boil it down for you.
Fuck Reebok!

426
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:09,833
All they do is ignore me.
Always have.

427
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:17,341
For a moment down there,
you got that chip off your shoulder.

428
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:22,868
You let people in.
You were brilliant.

429
00:44:24,016 --> 00:44:26,727
- Really?
- Brilliant.

430
00:44:26,935 --> 00:44:30,897
- See you tomorrow.
- You're loving me now.

431
00:44:31,107 --> 00:44:34,131
I'm showing you the money!

432
00:44:34,235 --> 00:44:41,221
I was just testing you, but to hear
you say that makes me love you.

433
00:44:41,325 --> 00:44:45,705
Jerry, come back.

434
00:44:45,914 --> 00:44:49,042
- How was your flight?
- Good.

435
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:56,237
If you can find your size, grab
some of those shoes by the door.

436
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:06,874
Cush, Matt,
we have a decision to make.

437
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:12,400
San Diego just came in with
a last-minute scenario. It's big.

438
00:45:12,505 --> 00:45:18,344
- He's got to go number one.
- San Diego wants him bad.

439
00:45:18,448 --> 00:45:23,766
- What happened to Denver?
- Before a draft, people get crazy.

440
00:45:23,871 --> 00:45:30,232
San Diego is offering seven years
for 30. Signing bonus of 8.

441
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:34,403
- Should I unplug the phone?
- Damn reporters.

442
00:45:34,611 --> 00:45:37,845
You just say, "No comment".

443
00:45:38,053 --> 00:45:41,807
I'm no good at
talking and saying nothing.

444
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,935
Let me.

445
00:45:45,665 --> 00:45:50,149
For you, it's a pleasure.
This is Cush.

446
00:45:50,357 --> 00:45:55,363
It's Sugar. Is Maguire there?
Sniff if he is.

447
00:45:55,571 --> 00:46:03,288
You're in with the big boys now.
I got you the deal you needed.

448
00:46:03,392 --> 00:46:09,649
This is business, not friendship.
You've got to be strong.

449
00:46:09,858 --> 00:46:13,820
Okay, buddy? See you later.

450
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,536
No comment.

451
00:46:26,438 --> 00:46:29,670
- He's got it all wrong.
- You're on TV again.

452
00:46:29,878 --> 00:46:32,694
I'm sick of me.

453
00:46:44,374 --> 00:46:49,483
Before I go back to Denver,
let's put something down on paper.

454
00:46:49,692 --> 00:46:56,052
- A contract with Jerry Maguire.
- Not right now, Jerry.

455
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:05,855
Do I know everything
there is to know here, Matt?

456
00:47:08,045 --> 00:47:11,173
You're not talklng with Bob Sugar?

457
00:47:11,381 --> 00:47:19,307
- Denver would only deal with him.
- Said who? Sugar?

458
00:47:19,411 --> 00:47:26,292
- I'm learning as I go here.
- You let him deal behind my back?

459
00:47:26,502 --> 00:47:32,446
I'm sorry... I love my son.

460
00:47:32,654 --> 00:47:39,223
I love your son!
I brought Denver to 20 million.

461
00:47:39,432 --> 00:47:44,333
You listened to Bob Sugar?
That is a child.

462
00:47:44,437 --> 00:47:48,921
You let that snake in the door?

463
00:47:49,755 --> 00:47:56,638
Okay, listen, rookie mistake.
I'll fix this Denver thing for you.

464
00:47:56,846 --> 00:48:01,539
You didn't sign anything
with Sugar, right?

465
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:06,545
Matt...?
Tell me you didn't sign.

466
00:48:06,649 --> 00:48:13,530
What happened to your "my word
is stronger than oak" thing?

467
00:48:16,033 --> 00:48:19,684
We signed an hour ago.

468
00:48:19,892 --> 00:48:23,750
You were in the lobby
with the black fella.

469
00:48:26,461 --> 00:48:31,050
Sorry, Jerry.
I just want to play football.

470
00:48:33,135 --> 00:48:37,931
- How do I spin this?
- Honey, it's spun!

471
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:42,520
- What did I do to you?
- It's all about you, isn't it?

472
00:48:42,728 --> 00:48:48,255
"Soothe me, save me, love me."
I have to finish my job.

473
00:48:48,463 --> 00:48:53,886
- Everything is on the run with us.
- We are salespeople. We sell.

474
00:48:54,095 --> 00:49:01,185
It's not trust my handshake,
it's make the sale! Get it signed.

475
00:49:01,394 --> 00:49:06,712
- Welcome to my nightmare.
- Is honesty outlawed here?

476
00:49:06,816 --> 00:49:14,116
- I would prefer loyalty.
- Our deal was the brutal truth.

477
00:49:14,324 --> 00:49:17,661
I think you added the "brutal".

478
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:23,084
There is a sensitivity thing that
some people have. I don't have it.

479
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:29,132
I don't cry at movies,
or gush over babies.

480
00:49:29,237 --> 00:49:35,284
And I don't tell a man who just
screwed up, "Oh, poor baby."

481
00:49:36,118 --> 00:49:40,186
But I do love you.

482
00:49:42,793 --> 00:49:46,963
- Avery, it's over.
- I didn't hear it.

483
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:51,343
- There's something missing.
- You've never been alone.

484
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:54,784
- You can't be alone.
- It's over.

485
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:04,691
- No one has ever dumped me.
- I'm not trying to make history.

486
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:12,720
I climbed El Capitan in 18 hours and
23 minutes. I can make this work.

487
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:19,811
No.

488
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,731
Oh, Jerry . ..

489
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,201
I didn't ever want to hurt you.

490
00:50:42,335 --> 00:50:49,009
I won't let you hurt me, Jerry.
I'm too strong for you. Loser!

491
00:50:53,075 --> 00:50:56,726
Roll with the punches .
Tomorrow's another day.

492
00:50:58,393 --> 00:51:03,399
- Taxi !
- You're loving me now, aren't you?

493
00:51:03,607 --> 00:51:06,214
Very much. Taxi!

494
00:51:06,423 --> 00:51:09,865
Didn't we arrive in a limo?

495
00:51:09,969 --> 00:51:15,496
I hope I don't sound too much
like a shrink here, but...

496
00:51:15,704 --> 00:51:21,231
- What's wrong?
- I'm just a big disappointment.

497
00:51:21,439 --> 00:51:25,611
Everybody cries on this show.

498
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:29,573
If you've tested positive,
quit doing blow.

499
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:35,099
Upset about your baby girl.
Why did you leave her mother?

500
00:51:35,308 --> 00:51:40,209
The media don't understand the
pressures $54 million comes with.

501
00:51:40,418 --> 00:51:45,631
- This is some bullshit.
- What are you doing wlth me, Rod?

502
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:51,367
- What?
- Don't you even see? I'm finished.

503
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:57,520
I am fucked!
24 hours ago... I was hot!

504
00:51:57,728 --> 00:52:01,482
Now, I'm a cautionary tale.

505
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:07,948
You see this jacket I'm wearing?
I don't need it. I'm a failure!

506
00:52:08,156 --> 00:52:13,160
I lost the number-one draft pick!
Why? Let's recap.

507
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:18,166
Because a hockey player's kid
made me feel like a jerk.

508
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:22,442
I ate some bad pizza, went to bed
and grew a conscience!

509
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:27,864
Boo-fucking-hoo!

510
00:52:29,324 --> 00:52:37,458
I've got ten years, tops. My next
contract has got to be a big one.

511
00:52:37,562 --> 00:52:46,113
I could be out in five years.
What's my family gonna live on?

512
00:52:46,321 --> 00:52:53,308
I don't want to hear your shit.
"I lost Cush and Avery..."

513
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:56,228
A drink, please.

514
00:52:56,436 --> 00:53:03,005
Anybody else would have left you
by now, but I'm sticking with you.

515
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:10,514
I'm gonna ride your ass like Zorro
till you show me the money.

516
00:53:12,287 --> 00:53:17,292
We're together on this.
You hear me? We're gonna be one.

517
00:53:18,647 --> 00:53:24,070
- The both of us... you know?
- My God!

518
00:53:28,241 --> 00:53:31,473
You have no messages.

519
00:53:56,708 --> 00:54:01,818
He's coming over.
He just lost his best client.

520
00:54:02,026 --> 00:54:07,554
This is not a guy.
It's a syndrome.

521
00:54:07,658 --> 00:54:12,558
It's early mid-life,
don't-let-me-be-alone syndrome.

522
00:54:12,663 --> 00:54:17,460
- But, if that's what you want...
- He's engaged.

523
00:54:17,564 --> 00:54:21,840
And for the first time,
I'm part of something I believe in.

524
00:54:22,048 --> 00:54:26,428
Okay...
but he better not be good-looking.

525
00:54:28,304 --> 00:54:33,310
Hi... I'm Jerry Maguire.

526
00:54:33,414 --> 00:54:39,253
Hello.
You're just the way I pictured you.

527
00:54:39,463 --> 00:54:44,572
- I'm her disapproving sister.
- Honesty.

528
00:54:44,677 --> 00:54:47,074
Thank you.

529
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:52,080
Thank you. Dorothy!

530
00:54:53,436 --> 00:54:57,398
Dorothy, your... boss is here.

531
00:54:57,606 --> 00:54:59,796
Hello.

532
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:07,826
- Hey, you.
- Thanks for inviting me over.

533
00:55:08,034 --> 00:55:13,457
- Where's the little guy?
- He's sleeping.

534
00:55:16,064 --> 00:55:21,694
I'm so glad you're home.
Being alone is not my specialty.

535
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:26,179
- My God!
- Yeah.

536
00:55:26,387 --> 00:55:31,914
Well, I broke up with Avery.

537
00:55:36,085 --> 00:55:41,404
- That's too bad.
- No, it's for the best.

538
00:55:41,612 --> 00:55:46,305
We'll still be friends.
It's better now than later.

539
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:52,874
- I'm dying here, aren't I?
- Yeah, it's a reaily bad cut.

540
00:55:53,082 --> 00:55:57,879
Just think if I had got her
the ring she really wanted.

541
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:05,283
Why don't you have a seat?

542
00:56:05,492 --> 00:56:11,331
I'll get some aloe vera for the cut.

543
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:14,981
- Do you have something to drink?
- Sure.

544
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:26,660
- I heard.
- I saw your shoes under the door.

545
00:56:26,869 --> 00:56:31,040
This guy is looking for anyone
who'll show interest.

546
00:56:31,978 --> 00:56:36,149
Don't use those.
Use the frosted glasses.

547
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:40,529
- I warmed up some chicken.
- I love you.

548
00:56:40,737 --> 00:56:44,492
I won't say any more,
but what about Ray?

549
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:49,288
He shouldn't hear
a strange man's voice in the house.

550
00:56:49,497 --> 00:56:54,920
- A drunken man's voice.
- What about ten angry women?

551
00:56:55,024 --> 00:56:58,361
Lean forward. Okay, I've got it.

552
00:56:58,569 --> 00:57:01,801
It's still edible.
Change your shirt.

553
00:57:07,745 --> 00:57:11,187
Hi, Jerry.

554
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:16,297
Hi, Ray,
aren't you supposed to be in bed?

555
00:57:16,401 --> 00:57:22,761
- Yeah.
- Don't worry, I won't tell.

556
00:57:23,595 --> 00:57:29,122
The human head weighs eight pounds.

557
00:57:38,195 --> 00:57:43,513
- Jerry Maguire.
- I think it's this one.

558
00:57:43,617 --> 00:57:48,727
You should be dreaming about me.
Think about me constantly.

559
00:57:48,935 --> 00:57:53,001
That's when the big dollars
are gonna flow.

560
00:57:53,106 --> 00:57:58,320
- Who is this?
- Rod Tidwell. Where's my agent?

561
00:57:58,529 --> 00:58:02,908
- My agent and I should be one.
- Are you a football player?

562
00:58:03,117 --> 00:58:09,687
A football player? I'm a school
teacher about to womp your ass!

563
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:15,526
I won't say anything else, but you
just can't fall for a drowning man.

564
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:19,488
Which top?
Turtle neck, sensible. V-neck, sexy.

565
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:24,389
What are other women my age
doing right now?

566
00:58:24,598 --> 00:58:27,935
They're out partying
trying to get a man.

567
00:58:28,144 --> 00:58:32,106
Trying to keep a man.
Not me, I'm trying to raise a man.

568
00:58:32,314 --> 00:58:38,258
This one. I've got a 24-hour-a-day
reminder of Roger for my whole life.

569
00:58:38,467 --> 00:58:42,951
I've had three lovers in four years.

570
00:58:43,055 --> 00:58:48,790
All of them ran a distant second
to a good book and a warm bath.

571
00:58:48,894 --> 00:58:53,274
I'm the oldest 26-year-old around.
How do I look?

572
00:58:53,483 --> 00:58:56,298
- Good.
- Yeah? Thanks.

573
00:58:56,507 --> 00:59:01,199
72% of new buyers
are African-American.

574
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:05,475
- You talk too much.
- It is a form of communication.

575
00:59:05,684 --> 00:59:10,063
- It was fun talking to you, Rod.
- Jerry...!

576
00:59:10,272 --> 00:59:14,130
I'll make you a ham sandwich.

577
00:59:14,234 --> 00:59:18,823
- I'm glad you listen to me.
- Well, I love you.

578
00:59:18,927 --> 00:59:25,496
When my dad retired from the
United Way after 38 years, he said:

579
00:59:25,704 --> 00:59:30,814
"I wish they'd given me
a more comfortable chair."

580
00:59:31,023 --> 00:59:37,176
When my dad died, my mom took me
to the zoo and I loved it.

581
00:59:37,384 --> 00:59:44,683
- Let me tell you about my dad.
- No, let's go to the zoo.

582
00:59:44,892 --> 00:59:48,854
Okay, you're right.

583
00:59:48,959 --> 00:59:55,319
My whole life I've been
trying to talk... really talk.

584
00:59:55,529 --> 00:59:59,699
But no one wants to listen.
You know that feeling?

585
00:59:59,908 --> 01:00:04,183
- They just look at you...
- Let's go to the zoo, right now.

586
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:10,752
The zoo...
the fucking zoo's closed, Ray.

587
01:00:11,796 --> 01:00:17,531
- You said "fuck".
- Yeah, I did.

588
01:00:17,635 --> 01:00:22,224
- Is that...?
- I won't tell.

589
01:00:22,432 --> 01:00:29,001
Well... then I'm gonna have to
take you to the zoo.

590
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:34,007
I've got to go to bed,
my mom's coming in.

591
01:00:35,258 --> 01:00:41,827
- I've got to go to bed.
- Thanks for listening.

592
01:00:41,932 --> 01:00:50,274
Okay. Drinks, food,
and I called you a cab.

593
01:00:50,482 --> 01:00:56,531
- Good idea.
- Quiet, I have a little boy asleep.

594
01:00:58,407 --> 01:01:02,475
Our company!

595
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:08,939
A little speech before I go.

596
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:18,950
Do not worry about your future.

597
01:01:19,055 --> 01:01:25,519
You and your son are just fine.
You still have a job.

598
01:01:26,354 --> 01:01:31,985
But let me tell you something
about Jerry Maguire.

599
01:01:32,194 --> 01:01:36,991
You come after me,
and you will lose.

600
01:01:37,095 --> 01:01:41,788
I am a survivor.

601
01:01:41,996 --> 01:01:47,940
Dorothy Boyd, you are with
the Lord of the Living Room.

602
01:01:48,148 --> 01:01:54,404
The King of the Kingdom
and I am ...

603
01:01:57,534 --> 01:02:00,349
...drunk.

604
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:11,298
We meet again.

605
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:27,044
Here.

606
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:39,557
- Truth?
- Sure.

607
01:02:39,765 --> 01:02:43,728
I care about the job, of course.

608
01:02:43,937 --> 01:02:49,359
But mostly,
I just want to be inspired.

609
01:02:49,463 --> 01:02:55,824
- Me, too.
- What you wrote inspired me.

610
01:02:56,033 --> 01:03:01,142
I'm working with you
because of that memo.

611
01:03:01,352 --> 01:03:05,418
I loved that memo.

612
01:03:07,191 --> 01:03:10,840
It was a mission statement.

613
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:29,193
- Well .. .
- Sorry about the hand.

614
01:03:31,487 --> 01:03:34,616
You know that feeling?

615
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:41,603
You're not completely embarrassed,
but you know tomorrow you will be?

616
01:03:41,707 --> 01:03:47,963
- Don't worry about it, boss.
- Shit, you said "boss".

617
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:53,698
- Yeah, I did.
- Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.

618
01:03:53,907 --> 01:03:56,514
I do.

619
01:03:56,722 --> 01:04:00,998
- I'm harassing you right now.
- Well, I may not sue.

620
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:18,830
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

621
01:04:20,081 --> 01:04:23,939
Don't worry.

622
01:04:24,044 --> 01:04:32,594
I am going to take my one client,
and we are gonna go all the way.

623
01:04:33,949 --> 01:04:37,912
Because... I'm back.

624
01:04:39,372 --> 01:04:43,856
Don't worry.

625
01:04:57,933 --> 01:05:00,540
Good catch.

626
01:05:08,465 --> 01:05:13,471
- He needs a contract, Dennis.
- I'll be at The Crocodile at eight.

627
01:05:14,722 --> 01:05:16,808
You bet.

628
01:05:37,246 --> 01:05:41,313
What happened last night?
I thought I was your friend.

629
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:45,796
- Something came up.
- Okay. $10 million for four years.

630
01:05:46,006 --> 01:05:49,134
- You're dreaming.
- Ten for four.

631
01:05:49,343 --> 01:05:55,390
- He's got an attitude problem.
- He listens to me.

632
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:00,187
- He's a shrimp.
- He broke all records last year.

633
01:06:00,292 --> 01:06:04,358
I want a prototypical wide-receiver.
6'3", 220 lbs.

634
01:06:04,567 --> 01:06:07,904
Not some shrimp who bitches.

635
01:06:08,113 --> 01:06:14,265
Dennis, I'm asking you...
for a favour.

636
01:06:14,369 --> 01:06:20,104
I introduced you to your wife.
We've spent Christmas together.

637
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:24,171
- Holiday cheer.
- Jerry, you're reaching.

638
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:29,177
I'm asking you for a favour.
We have history, Dennis.

639
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:33,765
We got history.
You drove the prices up.

640
01:06:33,974 --> 01:06:38,665
- Now it's your turn to suffer.
- Dennis, don't...

641
01:06:44,506 --> 01:06:51,492
I talked with Dennis Wilburn
about your renegotiation.

642
01:06:52,952 --> 01:06:55,142
Talking?

643
01:06:55,246 --> 01:07:01,398
Jerry Rice, Andre Reed,
Chris Carter, I smoked them all!

644
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:08,385
Yet they're making the big dollars,
the kwan... and you're talking.

645
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:16,310
- Kwan? That's your word?
- Yeah, that's my word.

646
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:21,837
Some dudes might have the coin,
but they'll never have the kwan.

647
01:07:21,941 --> 01:07:27,572
It means love, respect, community,
and dollars, the entire package...

648
01:07:27,781 --> 01:07:30,700
...the kwan.

649
01:07:31,638 --> 01:07:39,355
- Great word... towel?
- No, I air-dry.

650
01:07:39,459 --> 01:07:44,986
Listen, Rod... I say this
with great respect for you.

651
01:07:46,238 --> 01:07:51,452
But those players you mentioned,
are marquee players.

652
01:07:51,556 --> 01:07:55,518
- This deal...
- Marquee?

653
01:07:55,727 --> 01:08:03,339
This is a renegotiation.
Show them your joy for the game.

654
01:08:03,443 --> 01:08:08,032
Bury the attitude a little bit,
and show them...

655
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:12,099
- You're telling me to dance.
- No.

656
01:08:12,308 --> 01:08:16,791
Get back to the guy
who first started playing this game.

657
01:08:16,895 --> 01:08:22,422
Way back when you were a kid,
was it just about the money?

658
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:26,385
Was it?
Was it...?

659
01:08:28,366 --> 01:08:34,101
Do your job.
Don't you tell me to dance.

660
01:08:34,206 --> 01:08:38,690
I am an athlete.
I am not an entertainer!

661
01:08:38,898 --> 01:08:44,633
I do not dance and I do not start
pre-season without a contract!

662
01:08:44,842 --> 01:08:49,743
- Fine, fine, fine!
- Jerry, talk to me.

663
01:08:49,952 --> 01:08:53,392
Breathe, Jerry.

664
01:08:54,957 --> 01:09:01,109
I am out here for you.
You don't know what that's like.

665
01:09:01,213 --> 01:09:05,593
It's an up-at-dawn,
pride-swallowing siege -

666
01:09:05,802 --> 01:09:10,495
- that I will never
fully tell you about, okay?

667
01:09:12,892 --> 01:09:16,334
God, help me.

668
01:09:16,438 --> 01:09:23,424
Help me.
Help me... help you.

669
01:09:23,633 --> 01:09:27,074
Help me help you.

670
01:09:33,852 --> 01:09:36,667
I'm sorry.

671
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:41,569
You are hanging on
by a very thin thread.

672
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:45,636
I dig that about you.

673
01:09:45,844 --> 01:09:50,119
No contract! Help me?
I'll help everybody.

674
01:09:50,329 --> 01:09:54,916
- That's my man.
- Hey, I'm happy to entertain you.

675
01:09:55,125 --> 01:10:00,130
- Help me!
- See you in Los Angeles.

676
01:10:00,338 --> 01:10:03,676
Jerry... come on, man.

677
01:10:03,885 --> 01:10:10,558
We ain't fighting,
we're finally talking.

678
01:10:15,251 --> 01:10:19,421
Unless you love everybody,
you can't sell anybody.

679
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:34,229
Dennis Wilburn is faxing his offer
for Tidwell on Thursday morning.

680
01:10:34,437 --> 01:10:38,296
- He said you'd be happy... glad.
- Happy or glad?

681
01:10:39,756 --> 01:10:42,675
Glad. He said glad.

682
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:48,933
- Glad is good.
- We could sure use that commission.

683
01:10:49,141 --> 01:10:53,833
I did a rundown
on where you stand financially.

684
01:10:55,919 --> 01:11:01,549
- My condo was devalued.
- You don't have to explain.

685
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:05,200
The other night... I apologize.

686
01:11:05,408 --> 01:11:10,831
- Yeah, what happened there?
- This is a working relationship.

687
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:13,438
Exactly.

688
01:11:13,646 --> 01:11:19,485
The other night I was lonely.
I felt you understood something.

689
01:11:19,694 --> 01:11:26,577
We've got a company to think about,
and I'll never try that again.

690
01:11:26,681 --> 01:11:32,416
You walked out on a job for me...
Can this be right?

691
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:35,961
Exactly.

692
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:41,488
I know right now you need
to be alone with your thoughts.

693
01:11:41,696 --> 01:11:46,493
Find out what's gone wrong
and fix it .. . alone.

694
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:52,646
Alone! Alone, alone.

695
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:58,173
- You want to go out to dinner?
- Great!

696
01:11:58,277 --> 01:12:03,387
I broke up with that loser,
and then he started stalking me.

697
01:12:03,595 --> 01:12:11,520
- What do you mean by stalking?
- Coming over uninvited.

698
01:12:23,512 --> 01:12:26,953
Excuse me... Ladies.

699
01:12:27,162 --> 01:12:32,167
Good evening,
I'm looking for Dorothy Boyd.

700
01:12:32,376 --> 01:12:38,111
- She's in the kitchen.
- Laurel... Hello.

701
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:42,908
- Where are you taking her tonight?
- You're the nanny?

702
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:46,245
- Au pair.
- Au pair?

703
01:12:47,704 --> 01:12:50,728
Jerry!

704
01:12:51,876 --> 01:12:54,795
He likes you.

705
01:12:55,004 --> 01:13:02,304
Ray, I've got some gifts for you.
Do you like presents?

706
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:07,413
Arizona Cardinals.
It's the team Rod plays for.

707
01:13:07,518 --> 01:13:12,523
- Is that your laundry?
- Would you like a Steelers hat?

708
01:13:12,627 --> 01:13:17,737
- I've got it in grey, too.
- Thanks, Jerry.

709
01:13:17,945 --> 01:13:23,576
And I've got an energy bar.
This will keep you up all night.

710
01:13:23,785 --> 01:13:28,165
That's not a good idea.
I'll take that.

711
01:13:29,728 --> 01:13:34,629
Hey, it looks like you've got a fan.

712
01:13:35,776 --> 01:13:39,948
That's more than a dress,
that's an Audrey Hepburn movie.

713
01:13:40,052 --> 01:13:45,995
I got a bit revved up at the thought
of an evening among adults.

714
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:51,105
- Jerry, Chad. Chad, Jerry.
- Yeah... Am I dressed okay?

715
01:13:55,172 --> 01:14:02,471
- Don't let him stay up too late.
- Tonight he'll learn about jazz.

716
01:14:02,681 --> 01:14:06,434
Good,
that'll put him to sleep early.

717
01:14:06,643 --> 01:14:09,354
I want to go too.

718
01:14:09,562 --> 01:14:14,464
No, you stay here with Chad
and be good. Kiss me.

719
01:14:14,672 --> 01:14:17,592
Let's go.

720
01:14:18,948 --> 01:14:22,701
- Good night.
- Give me a hug.

721
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:10,356
- I'll meet you at the car.
- You forgot your keys.

722
01:15:10,565 --> 01:15:14,632
Ray kissed him just like a dad!

723
01:15:14,841 --> 01:15:19,638
Wasn't that thrilling?
He must have been needing that.

724
01:15:19,846 --> 01:15:25,268
Don't cry at the start of a date,
just cry at the end, like I do.

725
01:15:25,373 --> 01:15:28,709
Don't be a shoulder
for him to cry on, either.

726
01:15:28,814 --> 01:15:34,861
Keys.
Oh dear...

727
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:07,083
Ever since you've met me,
I've been...

728
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:13,340
It was laziness,
my breakup with Avery.

729
01:16:13,549 --> 01:16:18,554
It doesn't just happen.
Somebody is always to blame.

730
01:16:18,659 --> 01:16:22,725
You work at it
like you do a job.

731
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:28,251
Maybe,
love shouldn't be such hard work.

732
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:31,381
Yeah, maybe so.

733
01:16:31,589 --> 01:16:36,803
But it's not every day you say
goodbye to a woman like that.

734
01:16:38,784 --> 01:16:42,017
A song for the lovers?

735
01:16:42,225 --> 01:16:48,482
- No, no, we work together.
- This is like an office meeting.

736
01:16:48,690 --> 01:16:51,506
I know what you mean.

737
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:58,493
It wasn't like my marriage to Roger
was any good, even before ...

738
01:16:58,701 --> 01:17:01,829
Before...?

739
01:17:02,663 --> 01:17:08,294
Jerry...
Let's not tell our sad stories.

740
01:17:13,299 --> 01:17:17,158
I'll be back in just a second, okay?

741
01:17:46,773 --> 01:17:50,318
They sting.
Let Chad catch the bee in the glass.

742
01:17:50,422 --> 01:17:55,532
He won't hurt him.
You've got such a good heart.

743
01:18:23,687 --> 01:18:30,152
- Well, this would be goodnight.
- Goodnight.

744
01:18:30,361 --> 01:18:35,366
I'll see you tomorrow.
It's a big day.

745
01:18:59,558 --> 01:19:03,730
- Well, goodnight.
- Goodnight.

746
01:19:41,687 --> 01:19:47,005
- Let me fix this.
- Good idea.

747
01:20:40,082 --> 01:20:44,045
I think you should not come in.

748
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:48,841
Or... come in.

749
01:20:49,051 --> 01:20:54,369
- Depending on how you feel.
- The same to you.

750
01:20:54,473 --> 01:21:01,980
No, I have to go in.
I live here.

751
01:21:10,114 --> 01:21:13,660
Right.

752
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:20,021
I'll come in.

753
01:21:20,229 --> 01:21:23,462
Good.

754
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:34,412
Are you sure we want to do this?

755
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:39,625
Hell, yes!

756
01:21:49,218 --> 01:21:52,869
- Did he have a good night?
- Yeah, he's asleep.

757
01:21:52,973 --> 01:21:58,187
- How did it go with sport-boy?
- Still going.

758
01:21:58,395 --> 01:22:00,480
All right.

759
01:22:04,235 --> 01:22:07,571
Chad... how are you?

760
01:22:09,866 --> 01:22:13,515
- Treat her right.
- Yeah...

761
01:22:15,705 --> 01:22:18,625
She's great.

762
01:22:21,648 --> 01:22:27,802
I know this might be awkward,
but I want you to use this.

763
01:22:27,906 --> 01:22:30,930
God, Chad...

764
01:22:31,034 --> 01:22:36,248
This is Miles Davis
and John Coltrane.

765
01:22:36,456 --> 01:22:39,480
Stockholm 1963.

766
01:22:39,689 --> 01:22:44,694
Two masters of freedom, playing
before their art was corrupted -

767
01:22:44,903 --> 01:22:54,288
- by cocktail-lounge performers
who destroyed this American legacy.

768
01:22:54,392 --> 01:22:56,895
Jazz.

769
01:22:58,459 --> 01:23:02,630
I've put some Mingus
on there, too.

770
01:23:08,574 --> 01:23:13,788
- No barriers, no boundaries...
- Chad, I got it.

771
01:24:07,178 --> 01:24:12,913
You know
this is gonna change everything.

772
01:24:13,017 --> 01:24:16,668
Promise?

773
01:24:21,569 --> 01:24:25,739
What is this muslc?

774
01:24:58,482 --> 01:25:04,218
I love getting up in the morning
and beginning another great day!

775
01:25:07,138 --> 01:25:13,081
Great!
Did you really need to do this?

776
01:25:24,135 --> 01:25:31,122
- I'm getting him up, don't worry.
- What? I'm just waiting for coffee.

777
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:35,709
- Just tell me one thing.
- No.

778
01:25:37,274 --> 01:25:44,157
I'm worried this guy may not have
an emotional marble in his head.

779
01:25:44,365 --> 01:25:50,309
Laurel, if I start talking . ..
I took a chance, all right?

780
01:25:50,413 --> 01:25:55,835
- This guy's on the bottom rung.
- Maybe I am taking advantage.

781
01:25:56,044 --> 01:25:59,485
Does that make me a bad person?

782
01:25:59,694 --> 01:26:05,429
Roger was popular and charming,
and not so nice to me, and he died.

783
01:26:05,638 --> 01:26:12,519
Why should I let this guy go when
my body tells me that he's the one?

784
01:26:12,728 --> 01:26:19,402
- I just wanted the fun details.
- Why didn't you say so?

785
01:26:19,611 --> 01:26:26,493
Well, you might be interested
in this one little detail...

786
01:26:28,161 --> 01:26:31,603
I love him.

787
01:26:31,707 --> 01:26:36,086
I do! I love him,
and I don't care what you think.

788
01:26:36,295 --> 01:26:42,865
I love him for the man he wants
to be, and for the man he almost is.

789
01:26:42,969 --> 01:26:48,183
I love him, Laurel. I love him.

790
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:51,207
Hi, Jerry.

791
01:26:52,562 --> 01:26:56,108
Act natural.

792
01:26:59,757 --> 01:27:05,493
- Tell me he's not there.
- He's not there.

793
01:27:05,701 --> 01:27:09,143
- Easy, ladies.
- Coffee, Jerry?

794
01:27:09,351 --> 01:27:14,670
No, thanks. We bottom feeders
prefer cereal first.

795
01:27:14,878 --> 01:27:19,153
- Let's have Apple Jacks.
- Apple Jacks it is.

796
01:27:19,362 --> 01:27:23,533
Dorothy... good morning, darling.

797
01:27:26,244 --> 01:27:29,476
- Good morning.
- What's going on?

798
01:27:29,685 --> 01:27:36,151
A lot. We've got a big fax.
We need this commission.

799
01:27:36,359 --> 01:27:40,217
Milk? Cheers.

800
01:27:48,038 --> 01:27:51,897
That was really great of you,
this morning.

801
01:27:52,105 --> 01:27:59,822
Let's just root for a big offer
so we can move into a real office.

802
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:04,097
Would you mind? Thanks a lot.

803
01:28:11,396 --> 01:28:13,795
Shit!

804
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:22,762
1.7 for three years?
We owe more than that!

805
01:28:22,971 --> 01:28:28,811
- I'll get back to them.
- They're fucking us in the ass!

806
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:32,669
I'm sorry,
I'm a little pregnant right now.

807
01:28:32,877 --> 01:28:38,821
- I feel like crying, Jerry.
- Don't take this so emotionally.

808
01:28:38,925 --> 01:28:43,097
- We'll roll with the problem.
- Why are you so calm?

809
01:28:43,305 --> 01:28:50,813
"Don't take it emotionally?"
You need to get emotional.

810
01:28:50,918 --> 01:28:54,985
- Get me Bob Sugar on the phone.
- Marcee...

811
01:28:56,444 --> 01:29:01,345
- You want to leave me?
- What exactly do you stand for?

812
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:05,621
- What do you stand for?
- How about integrity?

813
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:11,356
There's so much greed in the world
I don't know what to tell my son!

814
01:29:11,461 --> 01:29:15,944
But this guy isn't yelling,
"Show me the money!"

815
01:29:16,152 --> 01:29:20,949
Do you know he's broke
and working for you for free?

816
01:29:21,993 --> 01:29:25,642
Broke! Broke, broke, broke.

817
01:29:25,850 --> 01:29:31,481
- Sorry, I'm not so good at insults.
- That was pretty good.

818
01:29:33,671 --> 01:29:36,799
Let me show you something.

819
01:29:39,928 --> 01:29:45,142
- Here. Rod, read this.
- No, no, no...

820
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:49,417
This is important, Jerry.

821
01:29:49,522 --> 01:29:54,214
- I appreciate this, but...
- You should be proud of that.

822
01:29:54,423 --> 01:30:01,304
Tell me what to do. Tell me to eat
lima beans, I'll eat lima beans.

823
01:30:02,452 --> 01:30:08,917
Tell me if this is the best
we can get... He's my agent.

824
01:30:09,021 --> 01:30:14,966
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.
Reject that shitty contract.

825
01:30:15,174 --> 01:30:20,701
Play out your existing contract,
and next year you're a free agent.

826
01:30:20,909 --> 01:30:26,749
Baby, this is us. You and me.
We determine our worth.

827
01:30:26,957 --> 01:30:33,527
You are a strong, proud,
surviving, splendid black man.

828
01:30:35,508 --> 01:30:40,513
Marcee... you are the shit.

829
01:30:47,813 --> 01:30:53,131
- If you get injured, you get zero.
- It won't happen.

830
01:30:54,173 --> 01:30:58,345
Rod, it's a risk.

831
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:03,246
You bet on me, like I bet on you.

832
01:31:07,417 --> 01:31:11,171
You know?

833
01:31:14,091 --> 01:31:17,845
You know, baby?

834
01:31:17,949 --> 01:31:21,703
- You're so crazy .. .
- I love you, baby.

835
01:31:22,329 --> 01:31:27,543
- Let me kiss that head.
- Thank you.

836
01:31:33,903 --> 01:31:39,221
I'm taking that job in San Diego.
You can't afford me.

837
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:44,958
- You can't afford me.
- I'll find something for Tidwell.

838
01:31:45,062 --> 01:31:48,920
- I refuse to be a drain.
- We'll stay afloat.

839
01:31:49,128 --> 01:31:53,612
We'll stay afloat. Don't leave.

840
01:31:53,821 --> 01:31:58,305
- Rod, get on the camel.
- You've been on my ass all day.

841
01:31:58,409 --> 01:32:01,746
- He's my client.
- Get him on the camel.

842
01:32:01,954 --> 01:32:06,543
- We don't need a camel.
- It's a Camel Chevrolet.

843
01:32:06,751 --> 01:32:11,339
- See? He's feeling my pain!
- Get on the camel.

844
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:16,344
- I'm pulling him from this.
- Just get rid of the camel.

845
01:32:16,553 --> 01:32:21,454
- This isn't what I had in mind.
- Right, let's bounce.

846
01:32:23,435 --> 01:32:27,816
Pulling him?
You begged me to hire him.

847
01:32:28,441 --> 01:32:36,262
I know you needed that commission,
but this isn't exactly Reebok.

848
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:41,684
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Are we gonna be friends now?

849
01:32:41,788 --> 01:32:46,794
- Have you dated any single mothers?
- I was raised by a single mother.

850
01:32:47,002 --> 01:32:52,321
I think, after this, she's gonna
have to take that job in San Diego.

851
01:32:52,529 --> 01:32:56,909
First of all,
single mothers don't date.

852
01:32:57,118 --> 01:33:04,730
They've been to the puppet show
and they've seen the strings.

853
01:33:05,564 --> 01:33:10,361
Do you love her...?
Don't tell me you don't know.

854
01:33:10,569 --> 01:33:14,844
I don't want her to go.
We've been hanging out a lot.

855
01:33:14,948 --> 01:33:19,745
That's bullshit!
You've got to be fair to her.

856
01:33:19,954 --> 01:33:25,898
Single mothers are a sacred thing.
You've got to have the talk.

857
01:33:26,107 --> 01:33:32,363
She loves you. If you don't
love her, you've got to tell her.

858
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:38,411
The kid's amazing. He...

859
01:33:40,184 --> 01:33:43,104
I feel you...

860
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:48,318
But a real man wouldn't shoplift
the pooty from a single mother.

861
01:33:48,526 --> 01:33:54,053
I didn't shoplift the pooty.

862
01:33:57,285 --> 01:34:01,769
All right, I shoplifted the pooty.

863
01:34:10,528 --> 01:34:15,638
You know, John Coltrane
once said to Miles Davis...

864
01:34:15,742 --> 01:34:21,373
When you say goodbye to him, just
be cool. What's meant to be will be.

865
01:34:21,582 --> 01:34:27,109
You'll see each other. I'm losing
the only person who listens to me.

866
01:34:27,318 --> 01:34:30,967
- Seriously.
- You're doing the right thing.

867
01:34:31,071 --> 01:34:36,598
You need to start your life,
not cushion the fall for him.

868
01:34:40,039 --> 01:34:43,793
I'm almost sympathetic to the guy.

869
01:34:48,382 --> 01:34:51,823
Bye.

870
01:34:56,828 --> 01:35:02,042
Listen, you're gonna
like it in San Diego, Ray.

871
01:35:02,146 --> 01:35:04,753
Ray...

872
01:35:04,962 --> 01:35:09,550
It's gonna be great there.
You'll make a lot of friends.

873
01:35:09,655 --> 01:35:15,807
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Go ahead and go.

874
01:35:20,082 --> 01:35:23,628
Go ahead and go.

875
01:35:32,908 --> 01:35:37,392
- Are you okay to drive this?
- This rig? No problem.

876
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:42,606
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Get in the car.

877
01:35:42,814 --> 01:35:47,716
I'll see you in a couple of days...
and I love you.

878
01:35:48,966 --> 01:35:53,555
I love you, too... What?

879
01:35:53,763 --> 01:35:57,204
- Nothing.
- I'll see you soon.

880
01:35:57,414 --> 01:36:02,105
Look, if this weekend
should turn into next month, -

881
01:36:02,314 --> 01:36:07,946
- and next month into whatever,
don't make a joke of your life.

882
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:11,387
Go back and read what you wrote.

883
01:36:11,595 --> 01:36:17,018
You're better than the Bob Sugars.
Don't forget that.

884
01:36:34,119 --> 01:36:37,978
- Wait a second.
- No! Oh, God.

885
01:36:39,645 --> 01:36:44,547
- We can save on medical...
- Don't listen to him, Dorothy.

886
01:36:44,651 --> 01:36:49,865
What if we stay together?
What if we got married?

887
01:36:50,073 --> 01:36:55,496
- Would you stay?
- No, don't do that. Don't say that.

888
01:36:55,705 --> 01:36:59,250
Well... say it if you want to.

889
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:07,905
Will you marry me?

890
01:37:11,972 --> 01:37:16,143
What are you thinking?

891
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:51,702
Laurel! We're getting married.

892
01:37:51,911 --> 01:37:58,063
Do you, Jerry Magulre,
take this woman to be your wife?

893
01:37:58,375 --> 01:38:05,258
And do you, Dorothy Boyd,
take this man to be your husband?

894
01:38:06,092 --> 01:38:11,619
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

895
01:38:49,993 --> 01:38:52,913
I should go.

896
01:39:11,891 --> 01:39:14,915
We did it.

897
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:19,087
We sure did.

898
01:39:36,396 --> 01:39:40,776
You fuck this up, I'll kill you.

899
01:39:45,678 --> 01:39:48,389
I'm glad we had this talk.

900
01:39:50,369 --> 01:39:54,124
Look at them.

901
01:39:54,228 --> 01:39:58,711
She is so beautiful.

902
01:40:13,311 --> 01:40:18,004
I don't believe they taped this.

903
01:40:23,947 --> 01:40:29,057
I'm gonna release this to ESPN.

904
01:40:29,161 --> 01:40:35,313
- You think I'm joking.
- No, but I know where you live.

905
01:40:36,774 --> 01:40:41,466
You didn't have the talk, did you?

906
01:40:43,134 --> 01:40:45,533
No.

907
01:40:45,741 --> 01:40:50,225
Well, this definitely
was another way to go.

908
01:40:50,434 --> 01:40:55,022
Hey, Dorothy, come here.
Ladies and gentlemen...

909
01:40:55,126 --> 01:41:00,966
Mr. and Mrs. Maguire.
We're gonna have a great season.

910
01:41:09,829 --> 01:41:15,043
Hey, Scotty.
Tidwell did four for 36.

911
01:41:15,251 --> 01:41:19,944
- Jerry... he's having a good game.
- You bet he is.

912
01:41:20,048 --> 01:41:23,385
You're gonna miss him next year.

913
01:41:27,869 --> 01:41:31,727
I've got a great team behind me
and I'm loving it.

914
01:41:38,506 --> 01:41:44,449
- That's my mo-fo!
- Come here.

915
01:41:44,658 --> 01:41:51,436
Be the first man in the family not
to say that, and we'll let you live.

916
01:41:51,645 --> 01:41:54,669
Go kiss Daddy.

917
01:42:04,575 --> 01:42:09,164
I saw you limping a little,
after the first quarter...

918
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:17,506
I twisted my ankle.

919
01:42:17,714 --> 01:42:22,093
That went well.
Anybody else worth talking to?

920
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:24,700
Let's go.

921
01:42:25,952 --> 01:42:30,332
- How's your head?
- Terrible.

922
01:42:30,958 --> 01:42:36,693
How you doing, Rod? Tough game.

923
01:42:39,091 --> 01:42:45,347
That quarterback sucks.
He's gonna get me killed.

924
01:42:46,599 --> 01:42:53,377
My brains will be blown loose
before you get me my 10 million.

925
01:42:57,131 --> 01:43:02,867
You take care out on that field.
You're my entire client roster.

926
01:43:02,971 --> 01:43:07,454
- Go home to your wife.
- What's that supposed to mean?

927
01:43:07,559 --> 01:43:13,816
- What are you doing here?
- Giving you personal attention.

928
01:43:14,024 --> 01:43:17,256
- You don't want to go home.
- What?

929
01:43:17,361 --> 01:43:22,158
I'm just trying to talk to you.
How's your marriage?

930
01:43:22,366 --> 01:43:26,642
The husband and wife thing,
how is that?

931
01:43:32,690 --> 01:43:38,008
- Not everyone has what you have.
- Why did you get married?

932
01:43:38,216 --> 01:43:42,492
- I'm just asking as a friend.
- You want an answer?

933
01:43:42,701 --> 01:43:46,663
Loyalty... she was loyal.

934
01:43:51,147 --> 01:43:55,319
Everything... grew from there.

935
01:43:56,152 --> 01:44:00,741
It just... grew from there.

936
01:44:01,888 --> 01:44:06,580
- That's an answer?
- That's the answer.

937
01:44:06,789 --> 01:44:11,377
It's not sexy...
but that's an answer.

938
01:44:11,481 --> 01:44:17,842
"Tell him what he's won, Bob.
A beautiful marriage!" Shit!

939
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:23,681
I'm happy to entertain you,
as always, Rod.

940
01:44:24,725 --> 01:44:30,773
I have a question for you.
Are we really friends?

941
01:44:30,981 --> 01:44:37,446
You know, friends can tell
each other anything, right?

942
01:44:37,654 --> 01:44:42,347
I'll tell you why you don't
have your $10 million.

943
01:44:42,555 --> 01:44:47,561
You play for the money. You play
with your head, not your heart.

944
01:44:47,769 --> 01:44:53,400
When you get on the field,
it's all about what you didn't get.

945
01:44:53,609 --> 01:44:59,449
Who's to blame. Who's got
the contract you didn't get.

946
01:44:59,553 --> 01:45:05,601
That is not what inspires people!

947
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:09,146
Shut up!
Play the game from your heart.

948
01:45:09,355 --> 01:45:14,464
Then I'll show you the kwan.
And that's the truth!

949
01:45:14,673 --> 01:45:20,513
Can you handle it?
It's just a question from a friend.

950
01:45:20,722 --> 01:45:25,831
When they call you "shrimp",
I'm the one who defends you!

951
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:31,358
I don't want to be friends no more.
And quit using that word kwan.

952
01:45:31,984 --> 01:45:35,424
- I'll see you in L.A.
- No heart?

953
01:45:35,529 --> 01:45:40,013
I'm all heart, motherfucker!

954
01:46:16,615 --> 01:46:23,601
- How many concussions has he had?
- I can't get no respect.

955
01:46:41,328 --> 01:46:46,125
I went to see this so-called
black film the other day.

956
01:46:46,334 --> 01:46:54,259
No more salt for you. The biggest
game of the season is coming up.

957
01:46:55,093 --> 01:47:01,350
20 minutes of coming attractions.
All black films and all violent.

958
01:47:01,558 --> 01:47:06,459
- Brothers shooting brothers .. .
- I hate you going out alone.

959
01:47:06,668 --> 01:47:12,299
- Oh, baby .. .
- My Pisces queen.

960
01:47:14,071 --> 01:47:18,451
I hate seeing movies without you.

961
01:47:18,555 --> 01:47:24,186
I won't do it anymore, okay?

962
01:47:31,382 --> 01:47:36,595
- Baby.
- Baby!

963
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:40,245
- Now?
- Baby now!

964
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:48,274
- Ray, it's time to go.
- Do you take Visa? Take it!

965
01:47:49,839 --> 01:47:57,347
What were you thinking tonight,
watching them go through that?

966
01:47:57,451 --> 01:48:04,333
I was thinking,
"I hope he doesn't get injured."

967
01:48:06,002 --> 01:48:11,528
Sometimes I can't tell at all what's
going on in that head of yours.

968
01:48:16,638 --> 01:48:23,311
- And I don't know your noises yet.
- Well, when you wonder, ask me.

969
01:48:23,415 --> 01:48:27,483
Okay, I will.

970
01:48:27,691 --> 01:48:32,905
I thought I just did.

971
01:48:34,991 --> 01:48:38,953
- Why do you love me?
- Why do you love me?

972
01:48:39,161 --> 01:48:44,584
- Jerry, can I come and watch TV?
- Just for a few minutes.

973
01:49:03,668 --> 01:49:08,255
- He's not going anywhere.
- I know.

974
01:49:08,359 --> 01:49:14,721
- Can we talk about somethlng else?
- No, I'm incapable of small talk.

975
01:49:14,929 --> 01:49:19,100
But that's why you love me, right?

976
01:49:30,571 --> 01:49:36,410
I'm about personal attention.
I'm available to you 24 hours a day.

977
01:49:36,619 --> 01:49:41,624
I'll be in Phoenix tomorrow
for Monday Night Football.

978
01:49:41,729 --> 01:49:47,776
I can be in Indiana
by 11:30 Tuesday morning.

979
01:49:47,985 --> 01:49:55,180
I don't need an answer now.
I'll call you tomorrow.

980
01:49:55,389 --> 01:50:01,020
All right, thank you, Marilee.

981
01:50:02,272 --> 01:50:06,755
Indiana, Tuesday.
I'll be there.

982
01:50:10,092 --> 01:50:14,680
- It's my fault.
- What?

983
01:50:15,202 --> 01:50:21,146
It's not fair to you,
this whole thing.

984
01:50:22,501 --> 01:50:27,923
Come here.
Tell me, let me help.

985
01:50:28,132 --> 01:50:33,764
I took advantage of you and
I did it with the help of a kid.

986
01:50:35,223 --> 01:50:40,333
I was just on some wild ride.
I thought...

987
01:50:40,437 --> 01:50:46,172
I thought I was in love enough
for both of us.

988
01:50:46,276 --> 01:50:53,889
I jumped at your proposal
when it was still just hypothetical.

989
01:50:54,932 --> 01:51:01,292
I did this, and at least
I can do something about it now.

990
01:51:01,501 --> 01:51:06,611
I'm not a guy who runs.
I stick.

991
01:51:08,488 --> 01:51:15,265
- I don't need you to stick.
- What do you want? My soul?

992
01:51:15,474 --> 01:51:21,417
- Why not? I deserve that.
- What if I'm not built that way?

993
01:51:23,503 --> 01:51:29,552
- I think we made a mistake.
- What if it's true?

994
01:51:29,761 --> 01:51:33,514
Great at friendship,
bad at intimacy.

995
01:51:33,723 --> 01:51:37,686
That's the theme
of my bachelor film.

996
01:51:37,790 --> 01:51:41,960
I know, I watched lt.
I know it by heart.

997
01:51:45,715 --> 01:51:50,615
- I don't like to give up.
- Please...

998
01:51:50,825 --> 01:51:55,933
My need to make the best of things,
and your need to be responsible ...

999
01:51:56,039 --> 01:52:01,878
If we don't do something now, we
could lose ten years being polite.

1000
01:52:04,902 --> 01:52:10,533
Let's just call this next road trip
what it really is:

1001
01:52:10,741 --> 01:52:14,704
A nice long break.

1002
01:52:21,378 --> 01:52:24,610
What about Ray?

1003
01:52:27,113 --> 01:52:30,867
Well, you'll be friends.

1004
01:52:30,972 --> 01:52:34,621
- Friends?
- Yes.

1005
01:52:36,811 --> 01:52:44,111
- Of course you'll be friends.
- I'll take him to the zoo.

1006
01:52:45,570 --> 01:52:54,120
- So this break is a breakup.
- Come on, this isn't easy for me.

1007
01:52:54,329 --> 01:52:58,084
On the surface
everything looks fine.

1008
01:52:58,292 --> 01:53:05,592
I've got this great guy,
and he loves my kid.

1009
01:53:07,259 --> 01:53:10,389
And he sure does like me a lot.

1010
01:53:16,541 --> 01:53:20,399
And I can't live like that.

1011
01:53:22,067 --> 01:53:25,404
It's not how I'm built.

1012
01:53:57,730 --> 01:54:02,735
If this is empty,
this doesn't matter.

1013
01:54:24,529 --> 01:54:28,805
It was just a mission statement.

1014
01:54:59,672 --> 01:55:03,842
Hey, Rod, how are you doing?
How's it going?

1015
01:55:04,051 --> 01:55:06,345
Go.

1016
01:55:08,326 --> 01:55:12,184
- Where's your agent?
- I don't know.

1017
01:55:12,393 --> 01:55:17,190
You belong with the big boys.
You belong with the big money.

1018
01:55:17,294 --> 01:55:21,257
- You're Rod Tidwell!
- Get away from my guy.

1019
01:55:21,465 --> 01:55:26,054
- I was just handling it.
- Just go. Flee.

1020
01:55:26,262 --> 01:55:32,414
This is a nice moment for you.
I'm gonna let you have it.

1021
01:55:32,623 --> 01:55:37,003
Give me a call, Rod.
Say hi to Marcee.

1022
01:55:43,155 --> 01:55:48,786
- Thanks for coming.
- I missed you.

1023
01:55:48,890 --> 01:55:52,749
What can I say?
You're all I've got.

1024
01:55:55,043 --> 01:56:00,466
This is Frank Gifford in Tempe,
Arizona's Sun Devil Stadium.

1025
01:56:00,570 --> 01:56:05,784
The Cardinals are still alive
for a play-off spot.

1026
01:56:05,992 --> 01:56:12,248
The reason for that is the
outstandlng play of Rod Tidwell.

1027
01:56:12,457 --> 01:56:18,505
The Dallas Cowboys are on a roll.
They know they're in the play-offs.

1028
01:56:18,609 --> 01:56:23,302
If Arizona wins tonight
and next week, -

1029
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:29,350
- they'll make the play-offs
for the flrst time in 21 years.

1030
01:56:29,558 --> 01:56:33,208
You'd better not mess up tonight.

1031
01:56:33,417 --> 01:56:37,901
What did I say? He's always
nervous for televised games.

1032
01:56:38,005 --> 01:56:43,115
The Cowboys contlnue their mlssion
on Monday Night Football.

1033
01:56:50,518 --> 01:56:55,628
Hey, Shannon.
Great column this morning.

1034
01:57:10,331 --> 01:57:12,730
What a bruiser.

1035
01:57:12,834 --> 01:57:20,134
The Cardinals just refuse to go
quietly into the desert night.

1036
01:57:20,238 --> 01:57:24,825
I'm just trying
to be a little poetic.

1037
01:57:26,286 --> 01:57:30,144
A tough hit on Tidwell.

1038
01:57:30,352 --> 01:57:36,088
- I'd have made a touchdown.
- That's his sixth catch tonlght.

1039
01:57:36,297 --> 01:57:40,467
A first down
at the 19 yard line.

1040
01:57:40,676 --> 01:57:48,184
- Another savage hit on Tidwell.
- They're really working Tidwell.

1041
01:57:48,288 --> 01:57:54,754
- What does Daddy always say?
- It looks worse than it is.

1042
01:57:54,962 --> 01:57:59,758
- He's gonna kill himself.
- Will you be quiet!

1043
01:57:59,864 --> 01:58:03,617
Two minutes to play.
Dallas leading by three.

1044
01:58:03,826 --> 01:58:07,893
Second down and one,
at the Dallas 11 yard line.

1045
01:58:10,186 --> 01:58:14,149
Down he goes for a slx yard loss.

1046
01:58:14,879 --> 01:58:17,277
Good move.

1047
01:58:17,486 --> 01:58:21,449
Swenson had too many men
in that pattern.

1048
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:29,166
90 razor,
X-out on one, ready?

1049
01:58:31,667 --> 01:58:34,692
They had a chance there.

1050
01:58:34,901 --> 01:58:39,592
But from second and one
they've gone to third and seven.

1051
01:58:39,802 --> 01:58:43,451
Dallas 17, Arizona 14.

1052
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:49,082
Tidwell in motion.
Moving back to his left.

1053
01:58:49,291 --> 01:58:55,652
Swenson puts one into the endzone.
Tidwell Touchdown Cardinals!

1054
01:58:55,756 --> 01:59:01,075
Tidwell held onto the football,
but he's still down on the ground.

1055
01:59:01,283 --> 01:59:06,601
He hit the ground hard, but managed
to maintain control of the football.

1056
01:59:06,810 --> 01:59:11,084
- He's hurt, too.
- He's not getting up.

1057
01:59:11,293 --> 01:59:16,090
- Look at the players' faces.
- Get up, baby.

1058
01:59:16,298 --> 01:59:23,702
The trainer ls on the field. It was
Tidwell's ninth catch of the night.

1059
01:59:33,192 --> 01:59:37,675
Can you hear me, Rod?

1060
01:59:44,245 --> 01:59:47,999
Commercial! Show me what's wrong
with my husband.

1061
01:59:48,103 --> 01:59:51,441
I told you he was
too small for the NFL.

1062
01:59:51,545 --> 01:59:56,549
- I'm just stating the truth.
- Tee Pee, shut up!

1063
01:59:56,759 --> 02:00:01,763
Can't you be loyal to your brother?
Get the hell out of my house!

1064
02:00:02,494 --> 02:00:05,935
Hello? Hold on.
It's Jerry Maguire.

1065
02:00:06,769 --> 02:00:09,271
Punk!

1066
02:00:10,523 --> 02:00:16,780
- Jerry, I am freaking out.
- Marcee, he's unconscious.

1067
02:00:16,988 --> 02:00:21,368
Just stay calm.
I'll call you back.

1068
02:00:21,577 --> 02:00:24,496
There are good doctors here.

1069
02:00:24,705 --> 02:00:31,379
- I cannot stay calm.
- Stay calm.

1070
02:00:31,587 --> 02:00:34,507
Your family needs you to stay calm.

1071
02:00:34,716 --> 02:00:41,493
My whole life is this family,
and it does not work without him!

1072
02:00:41,702 --> 02:00:48,584
All eyes here at Sun Devil Stadium
are focused on Rod Tidwell.

1073
02:00:48,793 --> 02:00:54,424
Just do whatever you can
to get Rod to me.

1074
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:58,491
Do whatever you can.
Please, Jerry.

1075
02:00:58,699 --> 02:01:04,226
At a time like thls, you just hope
his familly is not watching this.

1076
02:01:04,851 --> 02:01:08,815
It could be his neck.
It could be his back.

1077
02:01:12,672 --> 02:01:15,696
Blink! Wake up!

1078
02:01:28,523 --> 02:01:32,172
Rod! Can you hear me?

1079
02:01:32,381 --> 02:01:37,177
Can you hear me?
Do you know where you are?

1080
02:01:37,386 --> 02:01:41,557
The trainer is still trying
to revive Tidwell.

1081
02:01:42,704 --> 02:01:46,250
- Rod...?
- Let's get him off the field.

1082
02:01:46,354 --> 02:01:49,483
- No...
- Get him off the field.

1083
02:01:49,587 --> 02:01:54,280
Wait, wait...
Let me enjoy this for a minute.

1084
02:01:54,488 --> 02:01:59,910
We're looking for some movement.
Is that his head coming up?

1085
02:02:00,015 --> 02:02:04,707
He's trying to get up.
He is getting up.

1086
02:02:20,245 --> 02:02:25,145
- The whole stadium is standing.
- He's up on his feet.

1087
02:02:54,239 --> 02:03:00,496
Here's a guy who's normally
very truculent with the media.

1088
02:03:15,615 --> 02:03:20,934
Rod, we're happy for you, buddy.

1089
02:03:36,471 --> 02:03:40,538
- Congratulations, Jerry.
- Thank you.

1090
02:03:40,747 --> 02:03:43,875
Congratulations.

1091
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:49,402
Jerry... Maguire!

1092
02:03:53,051 --> 02:03:56,076
I know.

1093
02:04:15,784 --> 02:04:18,391
Where's Jerry?

1094
02:04:37,891 --> 02:04:42,271
- We did it.
- You did it.

1095
02:04:43,627 --> 02:04:47,485
Why don't we have
that kind of relationship?

1096
02:04:55,305 --> 02:04:58,955
Is that your phone or mine?

1097
02:05:00,832 --> 02:05:03,648
Dorothy?

1098
02:05:03,752 --> 02:05:07,401
Marcee... No, he's right here.

1099
02:05:13,033 --> 02:05:17,725
We did it. I love you so much!

1100
02:05:21,896 --> 02:05:25,233
I love you!

1101
02:05:29,196 --> 02:05:35,556
I love you, Tyson.
How's the baby?

1102
02:05:52,136 --> 02:05:57,559
The problem is, like you
were saying, the biorhythms.

1103
02:05:57,663 --> 02:06:06,215
The neural pathways are set,
so it's hard for people to change.

1104
02:06:10,177 --> 02:06:17,059
I'm sorry, these stupid holidays
are making me feel more divorced.

1105
02:06:17,059 --> 02:06:20,188
The songs, the chocolate...

1106
02:06:36,038 --> 02:06:39,687
I have a confession to make.

1107
02:06:39,791 --> 02:06:47,300
I've listened to you all
tell a thousand sob-stories.

1108
02:06:47,404 --> 02:06:53,765
Maybe you're all correct.
Men are the enemy.

1109
02:06:53,974 --> 02:06:59,188
But I still love the enemy.

1110
02:07:12,952 --> 02:07:16,602
Hello.

1111
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:20,773
I'm looking for my wife.

1112
02:07:31,514 --> 02:07:34,954
Wait...

1113
02:07:43,088 --> 02:07:48,615
If this is where it has to happen,
then this is where it has to happen.

1114
02:07:48,719 --> 02:07:54,454
I'm not letting you get rid of me.
How about that?

1115
02:07:59,251 --> 02:08:05,299
This used to be my specialty.
I was good in a living room.

1116
02:08:05,821 --> 02:08:09,575
And now, I just...

1117
02:08:21,149 --> 02:08:29,596
Tonight... our little company
had a very big night.

1118
02:08:29,701 --> 02:08:34,080
A very, very big night.

1119
02:08:36,687 --> 02:08:40,858
But it wasn't complete.

1120
02:08:40,962 --> 02:08:47,427
It wasn't nearly close
to being complete.

1121
02:08:47,531 --> 02:08:51,807
I couldn't share it with you.

1122
02:08:51,911 --> 02:08:55,040
I couldn't hear your voice.

1123
02:08:55,875 --> 02:08:58,898
I couldn't laugh about it with you.

1124
02:09:00,566 --> 02:09:04,112
I missed my... I missed my wife.

1125
02:09:20,275 --> 02:09:26,115
We live in a cynical world.

1126
02:09:26,219 --> 02:09:31,329
And we work in a business
of tough competitors.

1127
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:47,492
I love you. You... complete me.

1128
02:09:48,847 --> 02:09:54,479
- And I just...
- Shut up!

1129
02:09:54,583 --> 02:10:01,360
You had me at "hello".

1130
02:10:12,518 --> 02:10:15,960
What a great discussion group.

1131
02:10:16,168 --> 02:10:20,651
Your father leaves home
on Christmas Eve.

1132
02:10:20,861 --> 02:10:25,344
Your mother had to sweep up
to pay your tuition.

1133
02:10:25,448 --> 02:10:32,852
Your brother lost a leg.
You've had a pretty horrific life.

1134
02:10:33,061 --> 02:10:38,796
- I'm not gonna cry, Roy.
- Well, I've got some good news.

1135
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:44,845
I've got a contract here from the
Arizona Cardinals. Four years.

1136
02:10:45,053 --> 02:10:51,309
$11.2 million and you'll get
to play in your home state.

1137
02:10:51,518 --> 02:10:55,376
What do think of that?

1138
02:11:11,957 --> 02:11:17,275
I love everybody.
I love my wife! Marcee!

1139
02:11:18,526 --> 02:11:22,385
I love my kids.
Tyson and my new baby.

1140
02:11:22,593 --> 02:11:28,120
My older brother and
my younger brother Tee Pee.

1141
02:11:28,328 --> 02:11:31,873
You're militant, but I love you.

1142
02:11:31,977 --> 02:11:37,817
- I love my teammates.
- We only have a half-hour show.

1143
02:11:38,964 --> 02:11:45,951
Jerry... Congratulations.
Good for you.

1144
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:51,374
- Hi, Jerry, you remember Troy.
- Yeah, we met in '93.

1145
02:11:51,478 --> 02:11:54,502
I enjoyed your memo.

1146
02:11:54,710 --> 02:11:59,716
- The Cardinals finally came around.
- We're out of time.

1147
02:11:59,820 --> 02:12:03,469
Wait, I'm forgetting somebody.

1148
02:12:03,678 --> 02:12:08,162
Jerry Maguire, my agent.

1149
02:12:11,082 --> 02:12:15,462
You are my ambassador
of kwan, man.

1150
02:12:15,566 --> 02:12:20,049
Rod, thank you...
We'll be right back.

1151
02:12:23,804 --> 02:12:28,497
- How did you like the zoo, buddy?
- It was great!

1152
02:12:33,919 --> 02:12:38,819
Hey, kid, throw the ball.

1153
02:12:50,812 --> 02:12:55,921
- Did you see?
- Oh, no... Let's go.

1154
02:12:56,130 --> 02:13:01,448
What? He won't make
the major leagues tomorrow.

1155
02:13:01,656 --> 02:13:09,165
But you can see he's got talent
and I know the right people...

1156
02:13:22,199 --> 02:13:25,536
I don't have all the answers.

1157
02:13:25,745 --> 02:13:30,542
In life, I've failed
as much as I've succeeded.

1158
02:13:30,750 --> 02:13:37,633
But I love my wife, I love life,
and I wish you my kind of success.
