1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,073

2
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,200
How much do you want, Daddy?

3
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,701
Twenty time.

4
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,375
Fifty?
Yeah, 50.

5
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,917
D'ya hear Rock Hudson
was a cock sucker?

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,173
Where d'ya hear that shit?

7
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:11,549
It's called a newspaper. Right there.
It's a shame, ain't it?

8
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,393
All that fine Hollywood
pussy just all being wasted

9
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:18,016
on a guy who smokes
his fucking friends.

10
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:24,443
Rog, this ain't the sandbox.
Twenty minimum. C'mon.

11
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,317
Shit. God damn.

12
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,899
Cheap son of a bitch.
I'm tryin'.

13
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,409
I got it, I got it.

14
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,070
Who the hell's
Rock Hudson anyway?

15
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,831
He's an actor, dumb-ass! You
ever seen North <i>by</i> Northwest?

16
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:47,381
<i>Hey, I've got a question for
everybody, who wants to bull ride? Hey!</i>

17
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,679
<i>One more time, make some noise!</i>

18
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,180
<i>Clap your hands,
stomp your feet!</i>

19
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:55,008
<i>It's bull ride time!
Let's bull ride!</i>

20
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,100
<i>You're sitting there at America's
number one spectator event.</i>

21
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,603
<i>The spills, the thrills,
the bumps, the bruises.</i>

22
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:08,031
<i>It's all part of America's number
one spectator event, bull riding!</i>

23
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,820
All right.

24
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,449
Calm the nerves, brother.

25
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,246
This is your day,
I can feel it.

26
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,203
Shit, I don't know, Ron.
Well, I do.

27
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,538
Eight seconds,
and look at this. Hey! Hey!

28
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,546
$640, all right? You do that,
and you're going to get blown

29
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,299
by a hundred dollar
hooker before you can

30
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,472
scrape the bull shit
off your boots, brother.

31
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,682
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

32
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:47,477
Eat that motherfucker!
Mmm?

33
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,149
<i>Clap your hands, stomp your
feet, make some noise!</i>

34
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,575
<i>It's bull ride time!</i>

35
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,742
Ready?

36
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,996
<i>Nine to five,
come on, make some noise!</i>

37
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,284
Yeah!

38
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,168
Four one thousand.

39
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,173
Fuck!

40
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,128
My God!

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Hold it!

42
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:26,353
You get back here,
you motherfucker!

43
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,018
Everyone get with
that man, c'mon!

44
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:34,699
Tucker!
I need you to arrest me!

45
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,112
Fuck off, Wood roof!

46
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,528
C'mon man! No shit!

47
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,362
Looks like you got a bunch
of pissed off customers.

48
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,488
Fuck you!
You gonna cuff me or not?

49
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,744
No! Figure it out yourself.

50
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,461
Son of a bitch!

51
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:50,961
C'mon! Back off!
Or I'll arrest all of you!

52
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,216
Son of a bitch!

53
00:04:56,545 --> 00:05:00,641
They're gonna kick the shit outta
you someday, Woodroof. Maybe worse.

54
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,728
Yeah, you gotta die somehow.

55
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:15,235
Handle your business, huh?

56
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,242
Get your shit together.

57
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,654
Shit, Tuck, you're starting to
sound like a goddamn old man.

58
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,824
How's he doing anyway?

59
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,086
There's good days and bad.

60
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,502
Oh, he's a tough old outlaw.

61
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,711
Just can't imagine
how disappointed he must be

62
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,468
in having a cop for a son.

63
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,598
Get the fuck outta my car.

64
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,012
Thanks for the lift, man.

65
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,432
Fuck!
You okay?

66
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,447
You rattled my brain.

67
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:58,567
What brain?

68
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,457
Arright, Clinto,

69
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,502
that shit is purer than a preacher's
daughter's pussy right there.

70
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,297
Not after you've just coughed
your lungs all over it.

71
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:56,920
One dollar.

72
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,836
I got your dollar.

73
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,298
There we go.

74
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,850
Hey, you thinking anymore
about Saudi Arabia?

75
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:07,184
They need guys over there.

76
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,769
Fuck, no.

77
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,848
Why d'you wanna go work for a bunch
of sand niggers anyway, huh?

78
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,651
'Cause they pay five times
as much, that's why.

79
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,692
Mmm-hmm. That's right.
I'm signing up.

80
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,526
They got hot ass over there?

81
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,112
It's a Muslim country.
Can't fuck the women.

82
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,581
That takes me right out, then.

83
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,456
Woodroof! There's been
an accident on platform 5.

84
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:32,956
They need an
electrician right away.

85
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,332
Yes, sir!

86
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,798
All right, check ya later.
All right.

87
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:39,466
Adios! Get to work,
lazy fucker!

88
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,341
Let me see that
preacher's daughter's pussy.

89
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,884
Dumbass spic. How'd ya get
your leg in there?

90
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:49,223
Ambulance coming?

91
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,305
He's illegal.

92
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:56,350
Call a fucking ambulance.

93
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,562
Call it!
Fuck!

94
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,653
I need an ambulance.
I'mma shut it down.

95
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:08,910
Platform 5, ASAP. There's a man down.
Repeat, man down.

96
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,872
His leg's caught in the drill.

97
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,692
Mr. Woodroof?

98
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,033
I see you found our stash!

99
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,745
I'm Dr. Sevard.

100
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,537
Why don't you go ahead
and hop up here for me,

101
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:55,118
if you don't mind.
Thank you.

102
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,753
I like your shoes.

103
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:07,635
We saw something which concerned
us on your initial blood work,

104
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,466
so we ran some
additional tests.

105
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,392
Some blood tests.

106
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,470
What kind of blood tests?

107
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,056
I don't use drugs.

108
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,812
We didn't test
your blood for drugs.

109
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,818
Well good. 'Cause it ain't
any y'all business anyway.

110
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:23,317
That's right.

111
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,484
Um...

112
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:34,158
You've tested positive for HIV.

113
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,494
Which is the virus
that causes AIDS.

114
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,340
You fucking kidding me?

115
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:47,424
Telling me that fucking Rock
cock sucking Hudson bullshit?

116
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:51,259
Mr. Woodroof, have you ever
used intravenous drugs?

117
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,764
Have you ever engaged
in homosexual conduct?

118
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,264
Homo? Did you say homo?

119
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,706
Yep! That's what
you said isn't it?

120
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,020
Shit, you fucking kidding me'?

121
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,109
I ain't no faggot,
motherfucker!

122
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,528
I don't even know
no fucking faggots.

123
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,106
Look at me.
What d'you see, huh?

124
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,363
The goddamn rodeo's
what you see!

125
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,238
Mr. Woodroof.
A'ight, so fucking watch it.

126
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,369
Mr. Woodroof,
could you just...

127
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:19,202
No, I can't do shit, you speak
fucking English, motherfucker.

128
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:20,628
Call me a motherfucking faggot.

129
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,129
I'll whip your
fucking ass, boy.

130
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,798
Your T-cell count
is down to nine.

131
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,128
A healthy person has
between 500 and 1,500.

132
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,216
So frankly, we're surprised
you're even alive.

133
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,054
Surprise is, you made
a fucking mistake.

134
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,980
Must have mixed up
my blood samples

135
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,273
with some daisy puller
or something,

136
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,475
'cause that shit ain't me.

137
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,903
We ran the blood test
several times.

138
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,488
Here's some information
about HIV and AIDS

139
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,610
that you might
find informative,

140
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,692
and these are
your test results.

141
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,207
Mr. Woodroof, if you could
listen to me for a moment.

142
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,745
I know this can be
a very scary thing,

143
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,081
I know you're probably feeling
overwhelmed right now,

144
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:09,090
but we would like to impress upon
you the gravity of your situation.

145
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,340
Based on your health, on your
condition, on all the evidence we have,

146
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:17,427
we estimate you have 30 days left
to put your affairs in order.

147
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,240
Thirty days?

148
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,782
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,743
Fuck this.
This is shit.

150
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,875
Fucking 30 day motherfuckers. Let
me give y'all a little newsflash.

151
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,129
There ain't nothing out there that
can kill Ron Woodroof in 30 days.

152
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,235
Shit, damn doctor
cut your balls off?

153
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:41,572
Shit, tell 'em you got a cold,
man, they give you two weeks off.

154
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,246
You should try it.

155
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,743
Well, you didn't
miss nothing at work.

156
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,836
Shit, I'd take
disability any day.

157
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,915
I tell them I got
a fucking cough,

158
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,763
and they tell me I got some
kind of HIV virus. Shit.

159
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,177
Fuck. Like I got AIDS.

160
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,683
Fucking hospitals man,
mixed up my blood samples.

161
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,561
Shit. I went to
the doctor's one time,

162
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,811
and they tell me
I had chlamydia.

163
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,019
I get back home,
I had fucking crabs.

164
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,274
It's what the fuck
I'm saying, man.

165
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:16,192
You tell 'em you
got a headache,

166
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,107
they tell ya
you got brain cancer.

167
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,114
Mmm-hmm. Shit, I hear
you can get that

168
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,447
just by touching someone,
or queers get it.

169
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,780
Fucking faggots.

170
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,955
That's it,
exactly why it's a mistake.

171
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,672
Well, what if it ain't?

172
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,794
What if what ain't?

173
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,047
A mistake.

174
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,264
Fucker.

175
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,644
Shit, I know you got a pussy
addiction, motherfucker.

176
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:52,065
Yeah.

177
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,269
Hey, Salt, hello, Pepper.

178
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,312
God damn.

179
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:58,940
Mmm.

180
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:03,740
We going?

181
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,913
Yeah, we going.

182
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,496
Hey, you wanna take
these ladies for a twirl?

183
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,831
You all head out man, I'm good.

184
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,538
I'll catch up with
you all, all right?

185
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,918
Yeah? You all right, brother?
You cool?

186
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,044
I'm cool.

187
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,876
All right. See you there.

188
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,590
All right, see ya in a little
bit, Miss Alaska, Miss Louisiana.

189
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,423
Bye, cowboy.

190
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,085
Azidothymidine, or AZT,
was originally developed

191
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,878
<i>as</i> a treatment for cancer.

192
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,043
With the onset of HIV, however,

193
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,128
we at Avonex Industries
began a trial,

194
00:15:58,206 --> 00:16:01,802
in which we administered AZT
to infected lab animals.

195
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,472
Initial findings suggested
increased CD4 counts,

196
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,970
restored T-cell immunity...

197
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:09,768
Isn't it also the case
that there were some

198
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,722
troubling side effects
with the animal tests?

199
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:17,730
Significant decreases in the red and
white blood cells in the animals?

200
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,820
Yes, but its effect
on the virus

201
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,775
is better than anything
else that's been tested.

202
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:24,567
Well, in '64, when AZT was
developed as a cancer treatment,

203
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,654
it was shelved clue to lack of
anti-cancer efficacy and toxicity.

204
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:29,739
Right.

205
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,743
We believe those problems
were dosage based.

206
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,577
So, you're gonna conduct
another animal study?

207
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,413
Actually, the FDA's
given us permission

208
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,253
to go straight to human trials.

209
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,046
Which is what
brings me here today.

210
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,469
We're conducting
a double-blind,

211
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:45,136
placebo-controlled
randomized trial

212
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,014
throughout the United States.

213
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:49,591
Dallas Mercy is one
of the proposed sites.

214
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:51,594
How long do you see
the trial going on?

215
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,850
We're hoping to fast track it.
Within a year?

216
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:57,357
During which time, the hospital

217
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,860
and its
administering physicians

218
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,859
will be very well compensated
for their efforts.

219
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,945
Sadly, the AIDS crisis will only
get worse before it gets better.

220
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,819
And I know I speak for
everyone at Avonex when I say

221
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,288
this is a unique opportunity.

222
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,951
A chance to be on the
forefront in finding a cure.

223
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,789
Does it not drive you
just a little bit crazy

224
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,713
to see these guys talking
about curing the sick

225
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,548
when they flash
their gold Rolexes?

226
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,386
What do they know about
treating a sick patient?

227
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:28,634
Hey, they're big pharma
reps, they're not doctors.

228
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:31,968
And like it or not,
this is a business.

229
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,060
How'd they get permission to
go straight to human trial?

230
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:36,230
People are desperate.
People are dying.

231
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,436
There's nothing else out there.

232
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:41,494
Fuck!

233
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,047
I need to see Dr. Sevard.

234
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:52,634
Dr. Sevard's not here today.

235
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,557
I can't wait 'til tomorrow.

236
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,305
If you tell me what the problem
is, maybe I can help you.

237
00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:01,140
You want a list of
my problems, huh?

238
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:03,317
My lungs are bleeding,
my skin's crawling,

239
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,144
I got a fucking
jackhammer in my head,

240
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,400
and that's the least of
my fucking problems, lady.

241
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,981
Mr. Woodroof?

242
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,160
No. No, no, no, no.
I don't want a nurse.

243
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:15,864
I want a doctor. I want
a goddamn doctor now.

244
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,328
Well, how can I help you?

245
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,250
You fucking deaf, lady? Hmm?

246
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,920
No, I'm a fucking doctor!

247
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,674
If you want to discuss
your list of problems,

248
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,595
you can meet me in my office
in 20 minutes.

249
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:33,130
Okay?

250
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,022
I like your style, Doc!

251
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,324
Mr. Woodroof.

252
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,284
Can you get me AZT?

253
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,914
Avonex Industries say they've
just released it for testing.

254
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,340
I wanna buy some.

255
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,967
Now.

256
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,465
That isn't how it works.

257
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,655
For about a year,
a group of patients

258
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,723
gets either the drug
or a placebo.

259
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,895
It's totally left up to chance,

260
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,723
not even doctors
are allowed to know.

261
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,941
So, you're giving
dying people sugar pills?

262
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:32,647
It's the only way to
know if a drug works.

263
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,656
Can you get some for me?

264
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,575
I got cash.

265
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,960
I can go a month, a week,
however you want to do it.

266
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,411
I hear you.

267
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:46,996
Unfortunately, no.

268
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,875
But when the drug
is proven to work,

269
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,794
and if you fit the
profile, then yes.

270
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:57,381
So, you're tellin' me
I'm as good as a horse

271
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,549
being sold for dog food, huh?

272
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,848
Okay.

273
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,520
Look here, how 'bout this
stuff overseas, huh?

274
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:16,241
Germany, they got this
Dextran Sulfate, a'ight?

275
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:18,076
And they got
this DDC in France,

276
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:19,952
supposed to keep
the healthy cells you got

277
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,406
from getting the HIV.

278
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,709
And they got
AL721 over in Israel.

279
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,626
How can I get some of this?

280
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,829
None of those drugs have
been approved by the FDA.

281
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,086
Screw the FDA.

282
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,384
I'm gonna be DOA.

283
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,712
I gotta sue the hospital
to get my medicine?

284
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,642
Mr. Woodroof, I assure you that that
would be a waste of your precious time.

285
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:48,851
There is a support group that
meets daily in Draddy Auditorium.

286
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:52,027
I suggest you try it out

287
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,355
and maybe go talk about your
feelings, your concerns.

288
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,155
I'm dying.

289
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,951
You telling me to go get a
hug from a bunch of faggots?

290
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,003
Good day.

291
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,760
Hey, Neddie Jay!

292
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,686
Gimme a shot of cactus
and a Bud back.

293
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:30,310
God damn.

294
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,440
Hard to say how much
I missed y'alls ugly mugs.

295
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,777
Hey, say Clinto, where are you
hanging your pants these days?

296
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,663
Get me another beer
will you, sweetheart?

297
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,740
Fuck you say?

298
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:51,119
I said grab me a cold
one, sugarcakes.

299
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,502
You looking to
get your ass kicked?

300
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,051
Nah, I don't want none of
that faggot blood on me.

301
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,300
Hey, Ron, c'mon! God damn it!
Fucker!

302
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:07,803
Hey, c'mon. We don't want
any trouble, all right?

303
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,515
It's that motherfucker
who's got the fucking problem.

304
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:14,346
The fuck's your problem, huh?

305
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,604
Hey, Ron, I don't want
no trouble, all right?

306
00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:29,074
Fuck y'all, man.

307
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,469
Fuck all y'all!

308
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:48,434
Goddammit, he spit on my face.

309
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:51,058
You got any soap?
Gimme a towel. C'mon!

310
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,517
Jesus fucking Christ.

311
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,316
So as I stand here tonight,
clinical trials are underway

312
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:04,617
with an eye toward
fast-tracking AZT

313
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:07,241
and making it available for the
public as soon as possible.

314
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,996
In short, I'm happy to say that
help may finally be on the way.

315
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,917
How long before
the drug's approved?

316
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:13,960
Yeah.

317
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,289
The FDA's standard procedure to approve
a new drug is eight to 12 years.

318
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,381
Hey, it's your
first time, right?

319
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,211
Back the fuck off, Tinkerbell.

320
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,800
I'll knock your teeth so
far in your goddamn throat

321
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,851
you're gonna be chewing
through your asshole.

322
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,147
What about Dextran Sulfate?

323
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,822
We're working
closely with the FDA

324
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:44,775
to make sure every effort
is made to fast-track...

325
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:46,701
We don't have time.

326
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,780
It's both ourjob and the
FDA's to make sure the drug is safe.

327
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,910
We don't have that long.

328
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,990
We're dead, right?

329
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,372
We're going <i>as
</i> fast as possible, believe me.

330
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:07,221
Just need to slow it down
a little bit.

331
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,970
Just gimme time to catch
my breath, will you?

332
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:19,310
I ain't ready to crawl in a corner.
I just ain't fucking ready.

333
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,359
So, you better be
listening, all right?

334
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,865
If I got one fucking
chance, show me a sign.

335
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,786
Just show me a fucking sign.

336
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,779
If you're not gonna look or buy a
dance, you could at least tip me.

337
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,779
Here's $20.

338
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:15,039
The dance, it ain't for me.

339
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:19,332
You just keep on
shaking it, he'll see ya.

340
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,201
<i>A beautiful
day in Dallas, Texas.</i>

341
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,582
<i>Just hope you had your coffee. Sunshine today.
It's gonna be mid 80$...</i>

342
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,189
Right here, motherfuckers!

343
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,086
There ain't no more.
They started locking it up.

344
00:29:10,164 --> 00:29:11,916
I got the cash!

345
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:19,473
Here.

346
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,596
The fuck is this?

347
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,397
In Mexico,
a doctor, he has some.

348
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:27,769
The fuck is this bullshit?

349
00:29:27,848 --> 00:29:30,192
You don't think I know what
you're fucking doing man? Huh?

350
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,586
<i>Mr. Woodroof? Ron?</i>

351
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,667
Ron?

352
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,171
Hi.

353
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,840
Beautiful.

354
00:29:57,336 --> 00:30:00,557
You're in the hospital.
You almost died.

355
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,226
I bet that didn't
surprise anybody.

356
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,730
What is that, a smile?

357
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,561
You've had a blood transfusion.

358
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,529
Mr. Woodroof.

359
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:17,398
I'm Dr. Sevard.

360
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:21,362
Yeah. Hey,
I remember you.

361
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:25,327
I need you to tell me where
you obtained AZT from.

362
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,459
How it got in your blood.

363
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,211
I don't know what
you're talking about.

364
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:40,048
Dealing in pharmaceutical
drugs is illegal.

365
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:43,057
Yep.

366
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,481
Get some rest.

367
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,729
Where you goin'?

368
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:54,527
Hang on a second. We
werejust getting somewhere.

369
00:30:54,935 --> 00:30:57,233
Honey, you don't have
the slightest chance.

370
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,821
I'm Rayon.

371
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,868
Congratulations.

372
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,128
Fuck off and go back
to your bed.

373
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,298
Relax, I don't bite.

374
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:21,675
I guess you're handsome in a Texas
hick, white trash, dumb kinda way.

375
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,724
Get the fuck outta here,

376
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,186
whatever you are, before I
kick you in the fucking face.

377
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,269
God damn.

378
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,519
Fine, be an asshole.

379
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,982
You wanna play cards?

380
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,907
You got cash?

381
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,333
How's that strike your fancy?

382
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:00,509
You mind if I snuggle?

383
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,756
Stay at the end of the bed.

384
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,926
$10 minimum?

385
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,385
Be my guest.

386
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,940
All right,
Miss Man, what you got?

387
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,904
Full house.
Jacks over threes.

388
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,454
Well, I'd have figured you for queens.
Motherfucker!

389
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,036
<i>Sorry, damn' .</i>

390
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,294
God damn it.

391
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,628
You all right?
Wait, relax.

392
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:44,259
Where's it at? I got you,
don't worry, just relax.

393
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:47,260
Relax. Breathe. Breathe.

394
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,259
Right there. Right there.
That's it, that's it. Breathe.

395
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,719
Get it. Get it.

396
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:54,021
I got it. I got it.
That's it.

397
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:57,145
Here, let me
get you some water.

398
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:03,444
Here, drink this, darlin'.
Drink this.

399
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:07,949
Oh, you gotta stay hydrated, or
else your muscles will cramp.

400
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:12,163
Is that better?

401
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,246
Yeah.

402
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,330
It's better, I got it. It's good.
I'll work that for you.

403
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,672
It's good. It's good.

404
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,594
God, you got nice feet.

405
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,143
Jesus Christ, I'm straight.
All right?

406
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,279
What the fuck
you in here for, anyway?

407
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,074
The AZT trial.

408
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,868
My friend is paying me
to split my dose with him,

409
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,788
that way, we'll both get some.

410
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:55,703
How much he paying you?

411
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,211
Five grand.
What?

412
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,414
I coulda charged him 20.

413
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,553
Hey!

414
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:12,592
If I want in,
will you sell me some?

415
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,347
I'm sorry, sweetie.

416
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,188
I can't split my dose
in thirds.

417
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,150
Besides, I made a deal.

418
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,992
Anyone who plays cards like you
ain't got five grand, anyhow.

419
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,911
Yeah, right here.

420
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:45,509
My Lord, sometimes you can't
get a moment's rest around here.

421
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,050
this guy,
and if you could just...

422
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,175
Mr. Woodroof!

423
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,599
Where are you going?

424
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:54,927
I signed myself out.

425
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:56,309
You're too sick to leave here.

426
00:34:57,177 --> 00:34:58,896
Worst case scenario being what?

427
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,478
We can make you comfortable.

428
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:05,233
What? Hook me up to the morphine
drip, let me fade on out?

429
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:08,780
Nah. Sorry lady, but I prefer
to die with my boots on.

430
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,143
I still live here, you hear me?

431
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:44,900
I still fucking live here!

432
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,960
Fuck you!

433
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,438
<i>RON". I'm looking for Dr. Vass.</i>

434
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:35,945
Speak UP-

435
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:37,773
I'm looking for AZT.

436
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,530
You won't find that shit here.

437
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,996
Looking to poison yourself?

438
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,373
Jesus fucking Christ.
Maria?

439
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,039
Check him in.

440
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:10,391
Cocaine, alcohol,
methamphetamine,

441
00:39:10,472 --> 00:39:11,815
AZT?

442
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,820
Well, that's what I call
a recipe for disaster.

443
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,273
This place is a shithole, Doc.

444
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,405
Who said I was a doctor?

445
00:39:21,483 --> 00:39:23,657
They revoked my license to
practice three years ago.

446
00:39:23,735 --> 00:39:26,079
That's why I'm
down in this shithole.

447
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,498
Why? What did you do?

448
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,963
These drugs you're doing, they're
breaking down your immune system.

449
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,757
Making you susceptible
to infection.

450
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,210
You're saying cocaine's
givin' me pneumonia?

451
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,547
No, I'm saying cocaine
made you more susceptible,

452
00:39:41,628 --> 00:39:43,380
<i>as</i> did the AZT.

453
00:39:43,463 --> 00:39:45,512
Nah, the AZT's
what was helping me.

454
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,677
The only people AZT helps
are the people who sell it.

455
00:39:48,802 --> 00:39:51,476
It kills every cell it
comes in contact with.

456
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:56,686
I'm gonna prescribe a regimen of
vitamins as well <i>as</i> the mineral zinc,

457
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,483
it'll build up
your immune system.

458
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:02,074
You'll also be taking aloe
and essential fatty acids.

459
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,117
Sound fun?

460
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:20,088
You missed your last
trial appointment, Ray.

461
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,465
Where were you?

462
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,840
Do you like this dress, 'cause I think
the neckline's a little plunging.

463
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,434
Rayon, the whole
purpose of this study

464
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,594
is to determine
if AZT is helping people.

465
00:40:30,677 --> 00:40:32,931
C'mon, Evey, you know there
ain't no helping me.

466
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,981
That doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop trying.

467
00:40:38,518 --> 00:40:41,693
Why are you so good to me?

468
00:40:43,523 --> 00:40:45,697
Bless your little heart.
Shut up.

469
00:40:48,528 --> 00:40:50,873
Just promise me you'll show
up for the rest of the trial.

470
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:54,536
I promise you that
I will try my very best.

471
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:57,505
I want you to mean it.

472
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:00,541
Okay.

473
00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:07,340
Is that Marcus from Home Ec?

474
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,262
I swear to God!

475
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:13,313
He has grown up, my Lord!

476
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,311
A little too plunging
by the way, I think, yes.

477
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,061
I appreciate your honesty.

478
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,900
Damn it.

479
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,123
<i>Well?</i>

480
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:40,206
Better. T-cell
count's improving.

481
00:41:41,581 --> 00:41:42,925
I Still got HIV?

482
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:48,304
You'll always test
positive for HIV.

483
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:50,300
And now you've got AIDS

484
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,931
'cause of all the toxic shit
you've been putting in your body.

485
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,268
You shot your immune system.

486
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:56,938
Now you got chronic pneumonia,
among other things.

487
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,018
It can cause memory loss,
mood swings, aching joints.

488
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,353
If it sucks, I got it.

489
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:02,690
Yeah.

490
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:06,195
I can't get my cock up,
all that shit.

491
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,150
If it is shit,
I got it, don't I?

492
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:12,704
Yeah, well, let's not start
a pity party too soon.

493
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,873
That is DDC.

494
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:19,246
It acts as an antiviral, similar
to AZT, but less toxic.

495
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:22,213
And this is Peptide T.

496
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:25,134
It's a protein,
totally non-toxic.

497
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,471
Early studies have shown that
this can help with all that.

498
00:42:28,628 --> 00:42:31,302
It's what I've been giving
you since you got here.

499
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,893
You can't buy this in the USA?

500
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,266
Not approved.

501
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,639
Shit.

502
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,318
Look at this place.

503
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:49,233
Fucking chinks, homos,
herbs, hot nurses.

504
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,570
You got a regular New World
Order going on here, Vass.

505
00:42:52,652 --> 00:42:54,746
You could be making
a fortune off of this.

506
00:43:10,295 --> 00:43:12,844
<i>You get caught,
don't say you got AIDS.</i>

507
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,123
<i>They'll never let you back in.</i>

508
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:33,032
And a blessed day to you, sir.
Have a blessed day.

509
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,534
Whoa.

510
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,360
- Anything to declare?
- No, nothing.

511
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,065
Have a good day.
Thank you.

512
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,068
And a blessed day to you, sir.

513
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,282
Father, passport please.

514
00:44:21,074 --> 00:44:22,577
Anything to declare?

515
00:44:22,742 --> 00:44:24,164
<i>No, sir, nada.</i>

516
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,266
You're a priest?
Yes, I am.

517
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,442
I'm Richard Barkley from the Food
and Drug Administration office.

518
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,398
How can I help you,
Mr. Barkley?

519
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,402
Well...

520
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,791
You have over 3,000 pills here.

521
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,956
You're only allowed to
bring in a 90-day supply.

522
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:08,039
Yes, <i>as</i> I was telling
the gentleman earlier,

523
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:09,465
I'm a sick man.

524
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,547
I happen to have cancer.

525
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:17,052
I take 33 pills a day.

526
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,806
These are my vials of vitamins,

527
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:24,141
that is a non-toxic
protein serum.

528
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,144
This is my
90-day supply.

529
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:34,481
Vitamins?

530
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,994
You do realize that importing
illegal drugs for sale,

531
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,666
it's a very serious offense.

532
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,581
Well, of course it is,
and as I said,

533
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,708
they're not for sale,
nor are they illegal.

534
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,164
Merely unapproved.

535
00:45:55,168 --> 00:45:56,590
If we get the slightest
indication that

536
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,172
you're selling
these drugs for profit,

537
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:03,512
you could be thrown in jail
for a very long time, Father.

538
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:10,851
Hand to God, I promise to take every
single one of these pills myself.

539
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,489
My life depends on them, son.

540
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:15,836
Cowboy, you coming in?

541
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,213
Fuckin' kiddin' me?

542
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,849
This man also
had a transfusion.

543
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:28,269
The AZT, we can tell who's
on it by the symptoms.

544
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,431
Most of them need new blood.

545
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,730
He's actually getting worse.

546
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,943
So why are they
stopping the trial?

547
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,190
What d'you mean?

548
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:38,943
Avonex Industries.
You didn't see the memo?

549
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:43,574
Claim most people are feeling
better, and fewer people are dying.

550
00:47:43,693 --> 00:47:45,195
Transfusions always make
patients feel better.

551
00:47:45,278 --> 00:47:48,123
Give the placebo patients new
blood, they'll feel better, too.

552
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,876
I have questions about
the drug's safety, David.

553
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,373
It's dropping white blood cells
in a lot of my patients.

554
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,172
Yeah, well,
it's their call, Eve,

555
00:47:55,246 --> 00:47:57,045
so we can get the drug to the
people who actually need it.

556
00:47:57,123 --> 00:47:58,125
But after eight months?

557
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,880
Well, the test results were
overwhelmingly positive. AZT works.

558
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:05,023
We don't know what the long-term effects are.
It's irresponsible.

559
00:48:05,423 --> 00:48:07,050
These people die, Eve.

560
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,804
There are
no long-term effects.

561
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,889
Can I read a copy of the study?

562
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,807
Still being written.

563
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,074
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

564
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,070
Jesus fucking Christ,
you fucking idiot!

565
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,079
I've been looking
for you, Lonestar.

566
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,990
Know I coulda killed you, huh?

567
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,244
I feel better,
I wanted to thank you.

568
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,670
Well, good for you, now get
the fuck outta my car.

569
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,085
I need more of that
cocktail shit you got.

570
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,757
Listen, Tinkerbell, unless you
got more cash or new clients,

571
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,302
I'm busy, now get
the fuck outta my car.

572
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:44,927
Let's just do this quickly
so I can get the fuck out.

573
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,182
You got enough for 20 of us?

574
00:48:51,594 --> 00:48:52,811
Yep!

575
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,849
You know what?

576
00:48:55,849 --> 00:49:00,105
You don't deserve our money,
you homophobic asshole.

577
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,824
Toodaloo!

578
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:19,210
Am I fuckin' dreamin' or what?

579
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,893
I got your 20 in the trunk.

580
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,393
Find me 20 more, cut you in.

581
00:49:38,516 --> 00:49:40,393
Five percent.

582
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,400
Adios, cowboy.

583
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:46,905
Fuck's your problem?

584
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:50,655
I can handle your insults,
but five percent?

585
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,753
A'ight, 10.

586
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:01,248
Twenty five,
take it or leave it.

587
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,719
I don't have all day.

588
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,179
God damn it.

589
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,110
Deal?

590
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:27,945
Deal.

591
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,744
We'll take care of y'all.

592
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,079
Two T's, one Vit.

593
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,288
How much is on each bottle.

594
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,126
Rayon!
Where the fuck you going?

595
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,550
C'mon in, it's a fucking
bore out here!

596
00:50:46,751 --> 00:50:47,798
God damn it.

597
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:11,619
He with the most honey
attracts the most bees.

598
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,820
Yep.

599
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,822
Lots of customers
here, darling.

600
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,913
A little smile
would go a long way.

601
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,766
Ever hear of Peptide T?

602
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:41,356
Thank you.

603
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,358
Fuck off.

604
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,485
Ronnie, where you going?

605
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,126
You've got to be kiddin' me.

606
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:12,884
This place is perfect. We wanna
lay low, not get busted.

607
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,181
Besides, I got a plan.

608
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,726
Well, it's very in, turquoise.

609
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,221
Right up your alley-

610
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:30,818
This place is disgusting.
We have got to disinfect.

611
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,992
Do not use
the word "we."

612
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,161
Now, you wanna put your apron
on, start cleaning shit up.

613
00:52:36,235 --> 00:52:37,909
I wouldn't know where to start.

614
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,083
Well, howdy, Counselor.

615
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,253
Hi, I'm Rayon.

616
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,420
That's my partner.

617
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:47,835
Business partner.

618
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,509
Your office is next door.

619
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,512
Have fun, boys.

620
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,518
Now, this is all
for your personal use?

621
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:10,195
Oh, absolutely.

622
00:53:10,269 --> 00:53:12,773
I got you the paperwork
for your corporation.

623
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,525
I do not wanna know
what that is for.

624
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:19,530
Well, I ain't selling
drugs no more, Counselor.

625
00:53:19,612 --> 00:53:23,288
I'm givin' them away, for
free by selling memberships.

626
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,994
Four hundred dollars
a month in dues,

627
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,704
and you get all
the meds you want.

628
00:53:28,746 --> 00:53:30,215
You son of a bitch.

629
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:32,384
Bitches. Plural.

630
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:34,059
There's a bunch of
faggots up in New York

631
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,726
runnin' a hell of
a racket just like this.

632
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,385
It's where I got the idea.

633
00:53:37,463 --> 00:53:39,967
Welcome to the
Dallas Buyers Club.

634
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,385
<i>Avonex
Industries announced today</i>

635
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:45,347
<i>that AZT has been approved as
the first drug to treat AIDS.</i>

636
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:48,400
<i>At the cost of $10,000
per year, per patient,</i>

637
00:53:48,474 --> 00:53:51,398
<i>AZT is the most expensive
drug ever marketed.</i>

638
00:53:51,644 --> 00:53:54,945
<i>Avonex stock jumped a whopping
12 percent today on the news.</i>

639
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:00,237
I know. I hope he's okay, too.
It's been too long.

640
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,248
Oh, my Lord,
I'll call you back.

641
00:54:03,322 --> 00:54:08,079
Michael and Ian, the happiest
couple in the entire universe.

642
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,416
Oh, my God.
Gimme some sugar.

643
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,927
Ian, you look like
a two dollar bill.

644
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,672
Hold on, you just
stay right here, okay?

645
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,346
I'm so glad that you came.
We're gonna fix you up.

646
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,346
Ronnie, we got
two new customers.

647
00:54:25,094 --> 00:54:27,143
You call me Ronnie again,

648
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:32,773
I'm gonna use this to give you that
sex change you've been hopin' for.

649
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,320
Send them in.

650
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:36,858
Meet the big boss.

651
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,112
C'mon in.

652
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,030
Oh, shit, sorry.
C'mon, sit down.

653
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:49,036
Rayon, turn that shit down!

654
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,541
Meds and the
treatments are free,

655
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,501
but membership is $400 a month.

656
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,213
All right? You're gonna
hafta sign a waiver.

657
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:58,048
We are not responsible for
the drugs that we give you.

658
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,385
You croak, you croak. It's
not our problem. It's yours.

659
00:55:01,547 --> 00:55:03,300
We have some AZT,

660
00:55:03,382 --> 00:55:05,635
and it helped Ian a
little in the beginning.

661
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,222
All right, first off, flush
that shit down the toilet.

662
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,648
It's bad news.

663
00:55:09,722 --> 00:55:12,976
Secondly, stay away from anything
that's gonna cook your insides.

664
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,478
You gotta stay clean.

665
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,735
Third, if your brain's broke,
your wires are crossed,

666
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,449
I got a little something called Peptide
T, it's gonna fix you right up.

667
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,490
Clear? I got a starter pack.

668
00:55:24,028 --> 00:55:28,250
I'll have more in a week.
Until then, watch what you eat

669
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,583
and who you eat.

670
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,210
$400.

671
00:55:32,411 --> 00:55:34,335
Rayon, give me some coffee.

672
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,213
Coming up, Ronnie.

673
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,846
He didn't call,
leave a message?

674
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,092
No, nothing.

675
00:55:43,172 --> 00:55:45,016
He did change his
address recently.

676
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,728
Thanks.

677
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:57,605
Shohu Okaiku? Uh-huh.

678
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,193
Interferon.

679
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:02,199
How much can I buy from you?

680
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,536
Yes, Mr. Yamata.
Let me figure out

681
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,864
how much I can
take off your hands.

682
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,367
Listen, I'm gonna
hafta call you back.

683
00:56:10,449 --> 00:56:15,581
Mr. Yamata, I have to go, I'm gonna
call you back, okay? Yes. Arigato.

684
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,666
What are you doing here?

685
00:56:17,748 --> 00:56:19,876
Well, I live here.
Where's Rayon?

686
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,132
You roommates?

687
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:24,427
Not exactly.
What are you doing here?

688
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,226
Roger Thompson?

689
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:35,143
This is my patient.
You treating these people?

690
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:36,351
They're treatin' themselves.

691
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:37,481
With what?

692
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:42,442
Vitamins, Peptide T, DDC, anything
but that poison you're hawkin'.

693
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,744
Say, you ever wear any color?

694
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,246
Seems like every time I see
you, all I see is white.

695
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:55,579
You have a white coat,
white shoes, white...

696
00:56:55,661 --> 00:56:57,505
Tell Rayon I was
looking for him,

697
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,050
and I'm telling my patients
to stay away from here.

698
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,010
Excuse me.

699
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,014
Say you wanna go grab a steak
sometime, I know it's red, but...

700
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:15,266
That's the shit
that'll rot your insides.

701
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:18,443
What a surprise.
FDA approved.

702
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,940
The fuck is potassium benzoate?

703
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,614
Preservative.

704
00:57:22,688 --> 00:57:26,909
You kiddin' me? Hey, don't pollute
me with this processed crap.

705
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,505
I'm eatin' healthy,
and you should too.

706
00:57:28,527 --> 00:57:30,780
It's protein,
it's good for you.

707
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,333
It's processed, put it back.

708
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,545
You can't tell me what to do.
Such a bully!

709
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,179
Hey, Ron.

710
00:57:50,257 --> 00:57:52,226
Hey, what say, T.J.?

711
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,856
How you doin', man?

712
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:58,559
Oh, just trying to make a
livin', you know how it is.

713
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,436
Yeah, I do.

714
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:07,492
Jesus, fucking
faggots everywhere.

715
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:11,451
Hey, T.J., this is Rayon.
Rayon, T.J.

716
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:12,742
Hey.

717
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,994
He said hi to you,
shake his hand.

718
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:22,923
C'mon, buddy,
what's your problem?

719
00:58:28,045 --> 00:58:29,092
Fuck you.

720
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,436
Shake his hand, T.J. C'mon.

721
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:43,775
Shake his hand, T.J.
Give him a good one.

722
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,780
All right?
All right.

723
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:50,197
Now, will you fuck off?

724
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,947
Go on back to
your miserable life.

725
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:56,282
Hmm?

726
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,936
What?

727
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,480
Put 'em back.

728
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,117
All right, guys, hang in there,

729
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,994
we'll get you
hooked up shortly.

730
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,416
Fifty bucks?

731
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:52,255
No. A'ight? You ain't got the
money, you don't join the club.

732
00:59:53,005 --> 00:59:54,349
Hey, everybody!

733
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:58,016
Let's get this straight.
Membership, 400 bucks.

734
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,771
If you're a member,
you get the meds.

735
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,731
If you're not a member,
you don't. Got it?

736
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,606
I'm not running
a goddamn charity.

737
01:00:05,726 --> 01:00:07,478
You need $350 more.

738
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:32,211
Your bags are all packed

739
01:00:33,045 --> 01:00:34,672
and here's your ticket.

740
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,853
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Ray!

741
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:43,931
Fuckin' high?

742
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,317
None of your business.

743
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:48,394
Well, when it concerns
my business,

744
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,355
it sure the fuck
is my business.

745
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:53,320
If I can't trust you,
it is my business.

746
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,903
You motherfucker.

747
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,492
Denise, get in here!

748
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:00,865
You're in charge.

749
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:03,827
No! You can trust me. Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Fucking junkie,

750
01:01:03,909 --> 01:01:05,036
look at you,
you're a fucking mess!

751
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,918
Oh, God.
Get your shit straight.

752
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:10,170
Or I'll chunk you to the curb along
with your 25 fuckin' percent.

753
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,336
Quit acting like
a little bitch!

754
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:17,306
Have my new Caddy at the
airport for when I get back,

755
01:01:18,215 --> 01:01:20,014
and watch over
that fucking monkey.

756
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:40,867
Mr. Woodroof.

757
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,244
Mmm.

758
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:56,050
Regarding your order.
Mmm-hmm.

759
01:01:56,128 --> 01:01:59,099
I am so sorry but we
are no longer allowed

760
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:02,143
to export interferon
to United States.

761
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,347
Well, what d'you mean, Doc?

762
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:08,855
<i>We discussed this two weeks
ago</i> on <i>the telephone.</i>

763
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:13,360
I was not aware of the
regulation two weeks ago.

764
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:16,692
I am sorry. I know
you've come a long way.

765
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:20,619
Fourteen hours on a plane

766
01:02:22,112 --> 01:02:24,661
but, hey, who gives
a shit though, right?

767
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:28,416
Look, if it's about money. I could
make it worth your while, all right?

768
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,793
I've got a briefcase
full of cash right here.

769
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:32,623
Please, understand.

770
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:39,673
Japanese doctors would be the only
ones who can make the purchase.

771
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:09,835
Slow drip.

772
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,288
Interferon?

773
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:12,873
Very strong.

774
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,548
God damn, I like
your style, Hiroshi.

775
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,827
Okay, prepare the sedation.
Ten milligrams of Propofol.

776
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:43,949
Can I have your
passport please?

777
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:47,784
Yes, have Dr. Sevard
proceed until I get there.

778
01:03:48,824 --> 01:03:50,793
I've gotta go.
Where you coming from?

779
01:03:50,909 --> 01:03:53,163
Oh, excuse me, um, Japan.

780
01:03:54,371 --> 01:03:55,793
Medical research.

781
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:00,132
Good to be back in the USA.

782
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:02,967
Thank you, sir.

783
01:04:58,143 --> 01:05:00,987
<i>We don't know what the drugs are.
He's got HIV,.</i>

784
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:02,527
Wood roof?

785
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:06,032
AIDS. I got AIDS.

786
01:05:07,152 --> 01:05:09,280
Won't you come on in,
join the party.

787
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:13,246
Ah, Mr. Woodroof.

788
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:14,710
Dr. See-vard.

789
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:19,670
I'll bet you're
surprised to see me.

790
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,963
Well, you nearly
killed yourself,

791
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:25,592
so we need to know where
you acquired the drugs.

792
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:28,759
Well, I need to know
just exactly

793
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,219
what you're pumping into
my bloodstream here, Doc.

794
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:34,606
All right, this is
a combination of AZT,

795
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:37,684
and you've also got
a full spectrum of...

796
01:05:37,766 --> 01:05:39,393
Don't! Don't!

797
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,822
I'm suing you for
attempted murder.

798
01:05:44,648 --> 01:05:45,945
Where's my stuff, Barkley?

799
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,277
Your stuff gave you
a heart attack.

800
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,532
Go to hell.

801
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,619
I'll say what goes
in my body, not you.

802
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:55,284
That decision, like it or not, is left
up to the people in this hospital.

803
01:05:55,367 --> 01:05:58,416
What d'you think, I'm one of your
goddamn guinea pigs, Sevard, huh?

804
01:05:58,496 --> 01:05:59,748
I look like a rodent to you?

805
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:03,210
Mr. Woodroof,
you think you're clever?

806
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:05,295
You shoot your body
full of an unknown drug

807
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,630
and you smuggle
in a two year supply.

808
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:11,385
Well, hear this.
I will bust you.

809
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,597
I will take your drugs and I
will burn them. You're done.

810
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,431
You're a fool if you
think you're helping yourself.

811
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:19,266
That's right, fucking
fooled you, didn't I?

812
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:22,353
You said I'd be dead in 30 days,
well, howdy fuckin' doody,

813
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:25,440
because it's a year later,
and look who's still here.

814
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,070
I'm done with you.

815
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,197
Ronnie!

816
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,362
You have anything
left to say to me,

817
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:32,492
you say it to my real doctor,
Dr. Eve Saks,

818
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:35,246
and you,
you bring a fucking army.

819
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:36,668
Mr. Woodroof,
please get back in the bed.

820
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,202
Enjoy the view!

821
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:40,626
The hell is goin' on in here?

822
01:06:40,996 --> 01:06:42,670
Dr. Eve's good
though, right?

823
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,717
Talk straight to
my fucking face.

824
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:49,389
You're his physician, and you can't
tell me what medications he's on?

825
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,262
He came in here once for advice

826
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,342
and I have no idea what he
does outside this hospital.

827
01:06:53,425 --> 01:06:56,929
Well, the FDA just confiscated
2,000 vials of alpha interferon,

828
01:06:57,012 --> 01:06:59,266
which he was about to sell to
AIDS patients, to our patients.

829
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,568
Actually, I've been reading
a lot about Buyers Clubs.

830
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:02,690
They've been
having some success

831
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:04,521
eliminating symptoms with
some of these new drugs.

832
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:07,777
Yeah, and without controlled trials,
we're not gonna find a cure

833
01:07:07,856 --> 01:07:10,076
because we're not gonna
have any legitimate data.

834
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,278
So tell your patients
to stay away from him.

835
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:13,871
Yes, sir.

836
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:18,166
<i>RAYON'. No.</i>

837
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:19,998
Yeah. Uh-huh.

838
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:23,123
Hold on, I said hold on!

839
01:07:24,289 --> 01:07:27,293
This guy says that the Florida
Buyers Club is cheaper.

840
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:30,130
Well, tell him to go back to
the fucking Sunshine State!

841
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,715
<i>That's what I'm telling
you, I can't get it back.</i>

842
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:35,018
What d'you mean you can't get it back?
It was authorized by a doctor!

843
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:38,518
<i>The FDA said it was a Japanese
doctor with no legal standing.</i>

844
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,518
<i>What can I say?
They make it up as they go.</i>

845
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:41,731
God damn it!

846
01:07:42,432 --> 01:07:44,981
All right, check Amsterdam,
China and Israel,

847
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,813
'cause that's
where the fuck I'm going!

848
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:55,992
I like your style, Doc!

849
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:05,949
Good doing business with you.

850
01:08:15,215 --> 01:08:16,637
<i>If I don't trust the white coat</i>

851
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,222
<i>who's trying to
sell me the drugs,</i>

852
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:21,431
<i>I FedEx it to Seattle to my lab
there, and they test it for me.</i>

853
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,891
Then I test it all on myself
before I give it to anyone.

854
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:27,104
I respect that you're
learning about your illness,

855
01:08:27,185 --> 01:08:29,225
but some of these people
need to be in the hospital.

856
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,113
Why? All they want
to serve up is AZT.

857
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:33,988
AZT helps eradicate the virus.

858
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:37,037
Fuck the virus! Dr. Saks,
you know this.

859
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:40,787
Once you got the virus, you're
married to it. AZT or not.

860
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,914
I'm talking about
symptoms and survival.

861
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,496
Look, I'm no scientist,
but shit...

862
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:48,333
You're not 'cause
you sound so scientific.

863
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:51,301
Are you fuckin' high again?

864
01:08:51,543 --> 01:08:53,011
Uh...

865
01:08:53,128 --> 01:08:54,220
Nope.

866
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,889
Why are my fucking
walls painted red?

867
01:08:58,967 --> 01:09:02,063
It's cranberry mocha,
it's for the holidays.

868
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,560
All right, look, people can
live with this disease

869
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,360
longer than they're
saying, right?

870
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:11,439
Ninety six percent of the people
in the USA who have AIDS today

871
01:09:11,521 --> 01:09:12,761
are gonna die
within six months.

872
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:13,940
I know the statistics.

873
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:15,072
Then use them.

874
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:18,529
You don't give AZT to somebody with
a broken immune system, it's toxic.

875
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:19,829
If you're abusing it
like you did,

876
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,828
and you're just taking it without
any medical surveillance,

877
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,000
of course it is.

878
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:24,578
Yeah, I did abuse it.

879
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:28,541
But I'm off it now, look at me.
I'm here. Feeling great.

880
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:30,000
And I'm not the only one.

881
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:34,837
Why is Boy George's mug
all over my fucking room?

882
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:38,429
It's Marc Bolan, silly.

883
01:09:39,007 --> 01:09:41,010
It's another babe
for your wall of shame.

884
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,265
Get out, both of you.

885
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,268
Take your sunflower
and get the fuck out.

886
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,520
Oh, c'mon, I'm not finished yet.
Now. Get out.

887
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:50,690
Isn't he cute?

888
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,421
Where the hell are
my trial patients?

889
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,170
We need you to
fill out this form.

890
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:18,006
We need your name, your
address, phone number,

891
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:20,716
your complete medical history
and bring it back to me.

892
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,891
Denise!

893
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:23,220
Excuse me.

894
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:28,145
Who's the girl?

895
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,395
She's a customer.

896
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,021
She's HIV positive?

897
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:33,069
She's got full blown AIDS.

898
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,074
Need your phone numbers,

899
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:44,658
and here I'm gonna need your
complete medical history,

900
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,993
because we need to know
what's going on before you...

901
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:16,105
No, no, off the Caddy.

902
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:25,577
Oh, for fuck's sake.

903
01:11:30,744 --> 01:11:32,587
No, you stick it in, pussy.

904
01:11:32,662 --> 01:11:34,289
Who d'you think's gonna do
that when I'm not here?

905
01:11:34,372 --> 01:11:36,091
Don't.

906
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:38,219
Stick it in!

907
01:11:42,088 --> 01:11:43,636
I swear, Ray,

908
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,224
God sure was
dressing the wrong doll

909
01:11:47,302 --> 01:11:49,180
when he blessed you
with a set of balls.

910
01:11:49,387 --> 01:11:50,730
Gimme that.

911
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,652
Now, look, it's one thing
for me not to like ya,

912
01:11:54,726 --> 01:11:56,979
but why can't you be
a better friend to yourself?

913
01:11:57,063 --> 01:12:00,658
If I really thought you were
interested, I'd tell you.

914
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:04,695
What you doin' here?

915
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:08,453
The IRS.
You're being audited.

916
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,036
Oh, fuck.

917
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:15,039
Now here's a couple of the
government's finest right there, huh?

918
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:19,252
Good job, boys, great stuff. It's
how they got Al Capone isn't it?

919
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,009
Don't piss 'em off. If there's
a fine, we'll pay it.

920
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:25,057
Well, if there's a fine,
no, you wanna fine me, huh?

921
01:12:25,131 --> 01:12:27,475
How much you want?

922
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:29,304
Ten grand? Twenty grand?

923
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:30,684
You think that's gonna stop me?

924
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,099
What's your
fucking number, huh?

925
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:34,774
What is it? Huh?

926
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,106
Take this, motherfucker!

927
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,818
<i>Operations are expected to
return to normal today</i>

928
01:12:39,896 --> 01:12:42,069
<i>at FDA headquarters
outside Washington,</i>

929
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:45,904
a <i>day after the arrest
of 175 demonstrators.</i>

930
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:48,534
<i>The protesters, some of
whom are dying from AIDS,</i>

931
01:12:48,613 --> 01:12:50,992
<i>blocked the entrances
to the FDA complex.</i>

932
01:12:51,074 --> 01:12:52,702
<i>They were demanding
faster action</i>

933
01:12:52,784 --> 01:12:54,305
<i>on new drugs to
treat the deadly virus.</i>

934
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:36,453
You don't have a snowball's chance
in hell wearing that thing.

935
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:38,083
Rayon, I can assure you

936
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:41,838
that I do not need help picking
up ladies from your sorry <i>ass.</i>

937
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:46,515
Trailer trash and rodeo groupies
do not count as ladies.

938
01:13:47,422 --> 01:13:49,175
You get her flowers?

939
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:58,104
Oh, hell!
Mmm-hmm.

940
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:01,524
Have a good time, girls.

941
01:14:01,686 --> 01:14:02,859
Oh, Ron.

942
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,414
Wildflowers, Texas style.

943
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:19,630
That's for you.
Really?

944
01:14:19,704 --> 01:14:20,706
Mmm-hmm.

945
01:14:21,164 --> 01:14:22,337
Well, that's beautiful.

946
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:23,909
I don't even hafta water them.

947
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,007
Nope.
Thank you.

948
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,136
Thanks for coming.

949
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:28,338
Sure.

950
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:33,099
Guess who paid me a
little visit today. Who?

951
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:36,805
IRS. They're trying
to run me out of town.

952
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,475
Got any idea who might
have tipped them off?

953
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:42,569
You don't believe
that I would actually...

954
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:48,402
No, no, not you. That snake you work
for, that's my prime candidate.

955
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:51,078
I gotta ask you if you can
watch what you say around him,

956
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,405
I mean, 'cause he's
got a hard-on for me.

957
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,909
As a matter of fact, if you heard
anything, hear anything in his office

958
01:14:56,993 --> 01:15:00,087
that might concern me or the
business, I'd sure appreciate

959
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:03,166
you share with me.
Appreciate it.

960
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:05,671
Hello sir, bring us your
best bottle of Cabernet.

961
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:13,926
Nice restaurant,
beautiful woman,

962
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,512
swear I feel
like a human again.

963
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:19,975
Why are we here?

964
01:15:20,056 --> 01:15:22,059
Well just for this, wine, dine,

965
01:15:22,225 --> 01:15:24,228
have a good time,
enjoy ourselves.

966
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,358
Right.

967
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:29,033
It's as simple <i>as</i> that, I promise you, doll.
C'mon, try it with me.

968
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,030
Breathe.

969
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:32,862
Relax, smell the steak.

970
01:15:32,944 --> 01:15:34,947
If you need more inspiration,

971
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:39,127
just look at the handsome man
sitting across the table from you,

972
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,123
paying for your dinner tonight.

973
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:43,460
Huh?
All right.

974
01:15:44,247 --> 01:15:45,545
Why d'you become a doctor?

975
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,588
Really?

976
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,882
Why'd I become
a doctor? Um...

977
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:51,680
I was good at science

978
01:15:53,631 --> 01:15:56,851
and my dad said that studying
history was a waste of time,

979
01:15:56,926 --> 01:15:58,349
so I went to med school.

980
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:01,979
Your dad sounds like a practical man.
He was.

981
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:04,480
<i>He was.</i>

982
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:08,439
Your turn, what about you?
Why did you become...

983
01:16:08,521 --> 01:16:09,944
Electrician.
An electrician?

984
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,024
Right.

985
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:15,488
My dad was an electrician,
pretty darn good one, too.

986
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:18,244
He was a hell of
a lot better drinker.

987
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:19,371
I can imagine.

988
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:22,453
Anyway, I was around it a
lot, the electrician part.

989
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:23,662
Got kinda good at it.

990
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:26,590
Liked to open shit up,
check out the insides,

991
01:16:26,664 --> 01:16:28,712
put it back together,

992
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,761
hell, somebody thought
I was good enough at it

993
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,679
to pay me
a little money for it,

994
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:35,382
so I kept some change in my
pocket and I ended up being

995
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:37,342
the proud owner
of a Texaco card.

996
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:40,934
What about your mom?

997
01:16:42,305 --> 01:16:43,728
Mom was a painter.

998
01:16:44,682 --> 01:16:45,684
Um...

999
01:16:47,435 --> 01:16:48,653
Kind of a gypsy woman.

1000
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:55,319
She got tired of the bullshit and
all that, you know how it is?

1001
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:56,744
She paint this?
Yep.

1002
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,743
Your mom?

1003
01:16:58,823 --> 01:16:59,948
Yep.

1004
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:03,376
You ain't gotta
hang it or nothin',

1005
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,203
I mean, I know, like,
you like everything perfect.

1006
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:06,833
I do not.

1007
01:17:06,913 --> 01:17:09,792
I will hang this.
I'm gonna hang this.

1008
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:11,760
Good.

1009
01:17:13,878 --> 01:17:15,346
Don't you wanna keep it?

1010
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,684
You enjoy your life,
little lady.

1011
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,019
You only got one.

1012
01:17:22,512 --> 01:17:25,858
Yes, sir, that's
my favorite grape juice.

1013
01:17:28,935 --> 01:17:31,984
Hey, thanks for coming.

1014
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,570
To wild flowers!

1015
01:17:34,649 --> 01:17:36,277
And bottle and rib eyes.

1016
01:17:56,796 --> 01:17:58,094
I'm gonna kill him.

1017
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:12,020
See you next week.

1018
01:18:12,645 --> 01:18:14,523
I have a court order
permitting me to confiscate...

1019
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:15,733
You all are handsome,

1020
01:18:15,815 --> 01:18:18,069
but if you don't have a search
warrant, you ain't coming in.

1021
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:19,198
Ron!

1022
01:18:19,944 --> 01:18:20,992
The hell is this?

1023
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,368
Sorry, Ron.

1024
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:23,869
Gentlemen, I'm gonna need y'all

1025
01:18:23,948 --> 01:18:26,747
to leave the premises in
an orderly fashion, please.

1026
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:29,413
Mr. Woodroof, I have a court order
permitting us to confiscate

1027
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:32,248
any and all non FDA-approved
drugs or supplements.

1028
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:34,301
My entire inventory.

1029
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:38,095
That's aloe vera, sir.
It's a plant.

1030
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:40,265
How the shit d'you
care if people eat plants?

1031
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:41,762
It's improperly labeled.

1032
01:18:41,841 --> 01:18:43,935
That's a violation
of FDA regulations.

1033
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:46,059
That's a bullshit technicality,
and you know it.

1034
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:48,060
Rayon, get my lawyer on the phone.
Yeah!

1035
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,359
We're concerned with preventing
a market for illegal drugs.

1036
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,779
What's illegal about a bunch
of vitamins and minerals, huh?

1037
01:18:53,854 --> 01:18:56,253
Vitamins and minerals that gave
you a heart attack, remember?

1038
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:57,740
No, I ain't selling
them no more,

1039
01:18:57,815 --> 01:18:59,318
you confiscated them, remember?

1040
01:19:00,485 --> 01:19:02,453
What, you got
Alzheimer's, Richard?

1041
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:04,743
Take some of that Peptide T.

1042
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,996
Fixes that, too.
No, I remember these.

1043
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:08,668
Yeah, it's a fuckin' protein.

1044
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:11,413
For dementia, which I have.

1045
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:15,252
And for the hundredth time, just
take a fucking look at my research.

1046
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:16,613
Mr. Woodroof,
I wouldn't want you

1047
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:17,752
to spend your
last days in jail.

1048
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:19,679
If you have a product
that you want tested,

1049
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,849
fill out an application
and go through the process.

1050
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:23,676
Don't threaten me,
motherfucker.

1051
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:28,185
The process. An FDA bullshit to pay up.
I know what the fuck that is.

1052
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:30,399
You'll be getting your
fine for non-compliance

1053
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:31,770
and improper labeling.

1054
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,318
- Yeah, shove it up your ass!
- Ron.

1055
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,192
Your lawyer.

1056
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:38,448
David!

1057
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:41,448
David, listen.

1058
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:44,029
These fuckers are coming
at me, man, from all angles.

1059
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,530
I wanna file
a restraining order.

1060
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,119
<i>Against who?</i>

1061
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:50,042
Against the government and
the fucking FDA, that's who.

1062
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,167
DO it!

1063
01:19:55,916 --> 01:20:00,796
<i>Now the FDA is proposing</i> a
<i>permanent change in its regulations.</i>

1064
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:03,640
<i>These new
regulations specifically</i>

1065
01:20:03,881 --> 01:20:06,635
<i>will have special criteria
that would apply to</i>

1066
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,518
<i>immediately
life-threatening conditions,</i>

1067
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:12,190
<i>recognizing that such patients</i>

1068
01:20:12,265 --> 01:20:15,189
<i>are willing to accept
the greater risk</i>

1069
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,654
<i>than that which
normally would be the case.</i>

1070
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:20,573
<i>The drugs may only be
purchased by individuals</i>

1071
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,743
<i>who have been prescribed
the medication by a physician.</i>

1072
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,912
Now, what the hell
does that mean?

1073
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:29,033
Means we were unapproved,
now we're illegal.

1074
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:31,536
You put the seat down?

1075
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:34,921
Right!

1076
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:41,045
Mmm-hmm.

1077
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:43,546
Yep!

1078
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:46,100
Now, I gotta get these MDs
to write some goddamn scripts

1079
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:47,762
so we can keep dealing.

1080
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:49,970
Mmm-hmm.

1081
01:20:53,931 --> 01:20:55,854
Look, I'm gonna stay on the
domestic side, all right,

1082
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:57,685
I need you to check out
the internationals.

1083
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:59,863
All right,
start with Amsterdam.

1084
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:01,939
Right. There's a Dr. Bradley
out in Alberta.

1085
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:03,367
He'll play ball with us.

1086
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:04,443
All right, call me back.

1087
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:06,740
Hey, Chelsea!

1088
01:21:07,945 --> 01:21:09,666
Get them smokies a round
of beers, will you?

1089
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:15,876
The credit cards are maxed,
pharmacy bills are due.

1090
01:21:15,953 --> 01:21:18,457
You better hang on to your
money, honey. Mmm-hmm.

1091
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:23,970
How 'bout that size, huh?

1092
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,974
I think they'd look nice on me.

1093
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:28,637
You ain't getting tits, Rayon.

1094
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:32,639
Now look here, memberships
are high, so is demand,

1095
01:21:32,762 --> 01:21:35,606
so all we need is more members,
and where do we get those?

1096
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:37,059
Uh...

1097
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:39,815
Support groups.
Exactly.

1098
01:21:40,645 --> 01:21:43,319
In the meantime,
we could try the bank.

1099
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:46,613
Yeah! Bonnie and Clyde
coming in for a loan.

1100
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,917
Would ya stop
staring at her tits, Rayon?

1101
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:55,538
You're starting to look normal.

1102
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:03,923
Oh, you keep the change,
honey, you deserve it.

1103
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:11,684
What you got?

1104
01:22:12,176 --> 01:22:14,475
<i>Sorry to hear about
your dad's Alzheimer's, Tuck.</i>

1105
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:17,811
<i>This stuff will help.
Woodroof.</i>

1106
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:20,025
There we go.

1107
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:46,716
This place is a shithole.

1108
01:22:47,628 --> 01:22:49,972
I'll give you $150 a month,

1109
01:22:50,047 --> 01:22:53,221
plus 20% off your memberships
for four months.

1110
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:55,479
Mr. Woodroof. Now
don't try and con me.

1111
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:56,645
We don't want money.

1112
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:57,896
What the fuck you want?

1113
01:22:57,972 --> 01:23:00,067
The house is free.
We wanna help.

1114
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,742
Well, that's good news.

1115
01:23:10,359 --> 01:23:11,407
Deal.

1116
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:16,578
You fucking with me?

1117
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,094
<i>RON". We got a club,
just down the street,</i>

1118
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:30,264
<i>where you can get the meds
that I'm talking about.</i>

1119
01:23:32,256 --> 01:23:36,103
<i>We treat more than five times
the amount of patients</i>

1120
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:39,349
as large AIDS clinics,
and get this.

1121
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:42,104
We got only
one-tenth the death ratio.

1122
01:23:42,225 --> 01:23:44,604
So, you wanna
be here some more?

1123
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:46,947
Check us out,
here's my information.

1124
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,194
<i>Step on up,
let's do some business.</i>

1125
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:54,279
<i>We're open 24/7.</i>

1126
01:24:13,923 --> 01:24:15,470
She looks great.

1127
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:20,100
I guess I didn't make the cut.

1128
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:24,484
You made that choice yourself.

1129
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,813
It wasn't a choice, Dad.

1130
01:24:28,896 --> 01:24:30,489
What do you want, Raymond?

1131
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:33,327
Oh, I'm fine, thanks, and you?

1132
01:24:34,819 --> 01:24:37,163
Long time, no see.

1133
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:43,078
I suppose I should thank you
for wearing men's clothes?

1134
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:44,412
Not embarrassing me?

1135
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:47,500
Are you ashamed of me, 'cause
I hadn't realized that.

1136
01:24:47,623 --> 01:24:49,171
God help me.

1137
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:51,628
He is helping you, I have AIDS.

1138
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:13,362
I'm sorry, Dad.

1139
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:29,962
I met somebody who's
been very kind to me

1140
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:34,503
and I'd like to
repay that debt,

1141
01:25:36,797 --> 01:25:38,050
but I need help.

1142
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:49,735
Please.

1143
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:54,407
How's Mom?

1144
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,193
Raymond.

1145
01:25:56,859 --> 01:25:58,220
Look, we're gonna
have to recoup it

1146
01:25:58,278 --> 01:25:59,824
under a different
name or something.

1147
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:01,407
<i>I understand
what you're saying,</i>

1148
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:03,012
<i>even with this new
rule from the FDA.</i>

1149
01:26:03,074 --> 01:26:05,998
<i>I'm sorry. Mr. Woodroof,
I'm not changing my mind.</i>

1150
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:07,170
God damn it.

1151
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:23,725
<i>RAYON'. God, when I meet you,</i>

1152
01:26:25,596 --> 01:26:29,443
I'm gonna be pretty,
if it's the last thing I do.

1153
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:35,110
<i>I'll be a beautiful angel.</i>

1154
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:44,203
Dr. Browning,
I understand, all right,

1155
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:48,537
but do you understand
where I'm coming from? You...

1156
01:26:48,619 --> 01:26:49,621
Doc?

1157
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:02,635
Not one fucking MD
will write me a script.

1158
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,604
Not one. Motherfuckers.

1159
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:13,315
Well, maybe this will help.

1160
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,948
Where d'you get this?

1161
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:30,587
D'you sell your ass?

1162
01:27:36,667 --> 01:27:37,920
Really,

1163
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:40,346
where d'you get it?

1164
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:46,682
I sold my life
insurance policy.

1165
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:51,311
Not like I'm
gonna need it anyway.

1166
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:24,052
Thank you.

1167
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:40,904
Guess who's going to Mexico
looking for a hot date, huh?

1168
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:42,576
What d'you say?

1169
01:28:42,692 --> 01:28:45,319
Do I look like someone
who takes vacations?

1170
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:49,078
Well, a little tequila, sunshine
and tacos never hurt anybody.

1171
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,408
Sounds nice.

1172
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:51,993
Is that a no?
Mmm.

1173
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:54,250
I kinda figured you
might rain on my party,

1174
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,585
but I had to take a shot,
didn't I?

1175
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,087
Listen, I'm onto something new.

1176
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:03,262
Looks real promising, and I
need to ask you a favor.

1177
01:29:03,337 --> 01:29:05,090
I need you to write
me some 'scriptions

1178
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:07,009
for when I come
back across the border.

1179
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:10,766
Now I may not need 'em, but
if I do, then I'll have 'em.

1180
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:16,525
You know this law the FDA just
passed is total bullshit.

1181
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:17,693
It's all lip-service.

1182
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:20,021
I know. You're right.

1183
01:29:20,104 --> 01:29:23,199
And I can't either, I'm sorry.

1184
01:29:23,274 --> 01:29:26,279
We can't write scripts for
random people, random drugs.

1185
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:27,871
Plus, what if something goes
wrong with these drugs'?

1186
01:29:27,945 --> 01:29:29,368
We could be sued,
lose our license.

1187
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:30,789
I know, I know.

1188
01:29:31,448 --> 01:29:34,578
I hear you.
Well, had to give it a shot.

1189
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:39,962
Speaking of, I'll be taking one
this afternoon thinking about you.

1190
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:41,716
<i>Señor?</i>

1191
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,378
Nah, you keep that,
Nurse Ratched.

1192
01:29:46,797 --> 01:29:48,970
Life <i>is</i> strange

1193
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:55,144
Sing to me, baby.

1194
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:20,582
Okay, I'm taking
you to the hospital.

1195
01:30:20,664 --> 01:30:22,337
No, no, no.
Rayon.

1196
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:24,506
No! Rayon! Trust me you need...

1197
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:25,929
No!

1198
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:33,144
I don't wanna die.

1199
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:36,689
I don't wanna die.
You're not gonna die.

1200
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:39,109
You're not gonna die, now
just come trust me, c'mon.

1201
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:41,314
C'mon!

1202
01:30:50,444 --> 01:30:52,162
The secretions
the caterpillar uses

1203
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:54,239
to protect itself during
the incubation period

1204
01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:58,037
act as a non-toxic
antiviral for humans.

1205
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:00,788
The answer to a question.

1206
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:04,042
Check this out.

1207
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:05,877
This is The <i>Lancet</i>
medical review,

1208
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:09,551
and they published this study
that was conducted in France

1209
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:13,302
and it proves that AZT alone is
too toxic for most to tolerate,

1210
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:16,810
and has no lasting effect
on HIV blood levels.

1211
01:31:16,887 --> 01:31:19,731
Now, of course, Avonex
Industries and the NIH,

1212
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:21,817
they didn't include this study
in their press release.

1213
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:23,485
Fuck no, they didn't.

1214
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:27,907
Now these are early trial
results for Fluconazole.

1215
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:29,234
The anti-fungal?
Yeah.

1216
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:31,327
Yeah, I read about this.

1217
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:33,826
Want to take some home?
As much <i>as</i> I can carry.

1218
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:43,918
You can come in if you want.
Oh, no.

1219
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,922
I took him off it
as you instructed.

1220
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:53,099
He's just on morphine now.

1221
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:54,350
Good.

1222
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,113
I'll be in my office.

1223
01:32:07,604 --> 01:32:09,106
Thanks for calling.

1224
01:33:24,515 --> 01:33:26,859
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've just been cleared to land

1225
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:29,438
<i>at the Dallas-Forth Worth
International Airport.</i>

1226
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,694
<i>Please make sure your seat
belt is securely fastened.</i>

1227
01:33:32,606 --> 01:33:34,654
<i>The flight attendants are currently
passing around the cabin</i>

1228
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:35,985
<i>to make a final
compliance check</i>

1229
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:37,748
<i>and pick up any
remaining cups and glasses.</i>

1230
01:33:38,695 --> 01:33:44,043
Walker, Dorsett, Blount,
Newsome, Jeff coat.

1231
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:47,538
These are patients?

1232
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:49,377
Yes, sir.

1233
01:33:57,047 --> 01:33:59,846
They're also the names of
players on the Dallas Cowboys.

1234
01:34:02,636 --> 01:34:04,184
No shit?

1235
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,688
That's a hell of a
coincidence, isn't it?

1236
01:34:09,018 --> 01:34:11,315
Ain't this a little ridiculous?
You said it.

1237
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:14,231
Can you prove
these are patients?

1238
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:16,655
Can you prove they're not?

1239
01:34:19,695 --> 01:34:21,823
How you doin', Denise?
All right.

1240
01:34:26,493 --> 01:34:27,996
These are the emergencies.

1241
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:31,587
Where's the idiot?

1242
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:34,592
I thought you knew.

1243
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:37,430
The hospital.

1244
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:11,793
I need security on the
fourth floor right away.

1245
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:15,043
What d'you say? I can't hear you.

1246
01:35:24,092 --> 01:35:26,220
Mr. Woodroof.
You need to wait outside.

1247
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:29,056
You son of a bitch.
You murdered him.

1248
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,813
Excuse me,
you need to wait outside.

1249
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:32,810
Murderer. You're a murderer!
Security!

1250
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:35,654
You call yourself
a doctor? Huh?

1251
01:35:35,729 --> 01:35:38,323
You're a fucking murderer!
Let go of me!

1252
01:35:40,318 --> 01:35:43,822
Don't let him kill you! Don't
let him fucking kill you!

1253
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:45,489
You're killing them!

1254
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:47,119
Take him out of this hospital.

1255
01:35:47,324 --> 01:35:50,578
Don't let him pump
that shit in you!

1256
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:52,505
You're a fucking murderer!

1257
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:48,681
Hey?

1258
01:36:49,052 --> 01:36:50,179
Mister?

1259
01:36:53,015 --> 01:36:54,063
<i>Jesus.</i>

1260
01:37:13,869 --> 01:37:14,917
I got the money.

1261
01:37:20,042 --> 01:37:21,386
Excuse me.

1262
01:37:23,253 --> 01:37:26,349
Ron, I got two from
Austin, both on AZT.

1263
01:37:26,423 --> 01:37:28,096
Their insurance is
paying for their treatment,

1264
01:37:28,176 --> 01:37:31,020
but they don't know if
they can afford to switch.

1265
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:32,266
Hook 'em up.

1266
01:37:33,847 --> 01:37:35,770
We're pretty cash poor.

1267
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:42,069
Sell the car.

1268
01:38:13,887 --> 01:38:15,935
Anemia, cancer,

1269
01:38:16,015 --> 01:38:18,894
bone marrow depletion,
seizures,

1270
01:38:18,975 --> 01:38:23,072
fever, hearing loss,
impotence, neuropathy.

1271
01:38:23,605 --> 01:38:26,154
Sound like AIDS to you?

1272
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:32,037
Nah, that there comes in a box of
AZT, a list of the side effects.

1273
01:38:33,865 --> 01:38:35,538
No wonder Rayon is dead.

1274
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:37,418
Rayon was a drug addict.

1275
01:38:39,204 --> 01:38:41,172
He didn't die
from one day of AZT,

1276
01:38:41,248 --> 01:38:43,717
he died from
the disease as a whole.

1277
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:46,800
And you stole my
prescription pad, Ron,

1278
01:38:46,962 --> 01:38:49,341
so don't accuse me of
acting irresponsibly.

1279
01:38:51,175 --> 01:38:53,018
Rayon came to
the hospital on his own.

1280
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:55,095
He got dragged out
in a goddamn garbage bag!

1281
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:56,896
He was my friend, too!

1282
01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:15,078
<i>RON". Read that.</i>

1283
01:40:22,182 --> 01:40:24,731
I want all my HIV patients
on the asymptomatic study

1284
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:26,904
to have their AZT doses
lowered to the minimum.

1285
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:28,322
Six hundred milligrams.

1286
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:33,578
I got over 3,000 people who need
to get their hands on Peptide T,

1287
01:40:33,653 --> 01:40:34,699
all right, including me.

1288
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:37,328
I understand. They shut your lab down.
What can I say?

1289
01:40:37,405 --> 01:40:39,828
Look, if I don't get it by the end
of the week, I wanna file a lawsuit.

1290
01:40:39,908 --> 01:40:40,956
C'mon, Ron.

1291
01:40:41,034 --> 01:40:43,628
You lost the restraining
order, remember?

1292
01:40:43,703 --> 01:40:45,206
<i>This is Texas.</i>

1293
01:40:45,288 --> 01:40:46,881
The court system's
your final resort.

1294
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:48,798
Well, then find a place
where it fucking ain't.

1295
01:40:48,833 --> 01:40:51,712
Go to San Francisco.

1296
01:40:51,796 --> 01:40:54,140
Get me a goddamn sissy judge.
Just figure it out.

1297
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:00,479
Ten thousand of 'em.

1298
01:41:01,346 --> 01:41:02,347
Perfect.

1299
01:41:14,944 --> 01:41:19,494
I would like to turn it over to my colleague
from the CDC to talk about prevention.

1300
01:41:28,832 --> 01:41:30,801
Mr. Woodroof.

1301
01:41:30,917 --> 01:41:32,636
Would you kindly tell us
what you're doing?

1302
01:41:32,712 --> 01:41:34,713
Oh, I'm just givin' people
information, Richard,

1303
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,881
about this trial I'm in.

1304
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:38,684
Wanna make sure they
know what's goin' on.

1305
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:40,261
And what is going on?

1306
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:43,063
Why d'you cut off
Peptide T, Richard, huh?

1307
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:46,188
Non-toxic drug that
I got proof works,

1308
01:41:46,266 --> 01:41:47,859
and that the National
Institute of Mental Health,

1309
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:50,313
your own people,
say is completely safe.

1310
01:41:50,395 --> 01:41:51,488
Pass this down.

1311
01:41:51,564 --> 01:41:54,738
Mr. Woodroof, I'm afraid
that you are nothing more

1312
01:41:54,817 --> 01:41:57,615
than a common drug dealer, so if
you'll excuse us, we would like...

1313
01:41:57,694 --> 01:41:58,947
Oh, I'm the drug dealer?

1314
01:41:59,404 --> 01:42:01,372
No, you're
the fucking drug dealer.

1315
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:03,326
I mean, God damn,
people are dying,

1316
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:05,368
and y'all are
all up there afraid

1317
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:08,081
that we're going to find
an alternative without you.

1318
01:42:08,163 --> 01:42:12,715
See, the pharma companies pay
the FDA to push their product.

1319
01:42:13,043 --> 01:42:14,966
So, fuck no, they don't
wanna see my research.

1320
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:16,467
All right! It's enough!

1321
01:42:16,546 --> 01:42:19,516
I don't have enough cash in my
pocket to make it worth their while.

1322
01:42:19,591 --> 01:42:22,185
Tell you what, I'm gonna be a pain in
your <i>ass</i> until I'm six feet under!

1323
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:26,356
Maybe one day, you'll get off
your ass and do your fucking job!

1324
01:42:26,431 --> 01:42:28,309
I need you to leave, let's go.

1325
01:42:28,643 --> 01:42:30,815
Here, <i>pass</i> these around,
would you?

1326
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:32,192
Come on, sir.
Let's go.

1327
01:42:32,354 --> 01:42:33,676
Don't listen to
those cocksuckers.

1328
01:42:42,030 --> 01:42:44,783
We think it is in everyone's
best interest that you resign.

1329
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:51,548
I won't.

1330
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,837
You'll have to fire me.

1331
01:42:55,293 --> 01:42:56,341
Eve!

1332
01:42:57,712 --> 01:42:58,965
Eve!

1333
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:01,057
Y'all go fuck yourselves!

1334
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:06,393
Well...

1335
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:16,985
One left.

1336
01:43:22,445 --> 01:43:24,698
That took some balls.

1337
01:43:27,534 --> 01:43:30,037
Hey, nice warm hug?

1338
01:43:33,832 --> 01:43:34,958
Yeah.

1339
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,759
That's what you need,

1340
01:43:38,837 --> 01:43:41,341
that and a day of
watching bull riding.

1341
01:43:42,841 --> 01:43:45,140
Dr. Wood roof's orders.

1342
01:43:57,648 --> 01:43:59,867
You ever miss
your regular life?

1343
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:03,783
Regular life?

1344
01:44:04,363 --> 01:44:05,956
What is that?

1345
01:44:07,073 --> 01:44:08,701
It doesn't exist.

1346
01:44:10,536 --> 01:44:12,037
Yeah, I guess.

1347
01:44:14,164 --> 01:44:15,962
No, no, I just...

1348
01:44:17,333 --> 01:44:18,711
I just wanna...

1349
01:44:18,793 --> 01:44:20,216
What?

1350
01:44:23,131 --> 01:44:26,226
Ice cold beer, bull ride again.

1351
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:31,814
Take my woman dancing,
you know?

1352
01:44:36,686 --> 01:44:37,984
I want kids.

1353
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:43,657
I mean, I got one
life right? Mine.

1354
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:48,198
But I want somebody
else's sometimes.

1355
01:44:55,079 --> 01:44:59,551
Sometimes I feel like I'm fighting
for a life I ain't got time to live.

1356
01:45:01,878 --> 01:45:03,596
I want it to mean somethin'.

1357
01:45:06,759 --> 01:45:08,511
It does.

1358
01:46:49,737 --> 01:46:51,956
Get out of the road, jackass!

1359
01:47:04,542 --> 01:47:06,216
Sir! You're in
the middle of the street.

1360
01:47:06,295 --> 01:47:08,797
Step over by your
vehicle right now.

1361
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:10,177
Step over by your car.

1362
01:47:10,256 --> 01:47:12,009
Hey, I got ya!
Sir, step out of the road.

1363
01:47:12,091 --> 01:47:13,890
Hey! <i>I</i> got it!

1364
01:47:13,969 --> 01:47:16,939
Ron, what the hell
is going on, huh?

1365
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:19,311
D'you understand me?

1366
01:47:19,390 --> 01:47:21,609
C'mon. I'll get you home.

1367
01:48:15,113 --> 01:48:18,118
The constitution,
specifically the Ninth Amendment,

1368
01:48:18,199 --> 01:48:20,167
does not state that
you have the right

1369
01:48:20,243 --> 01:48:23,247
to be mentally healthy
or physically healthy.

1370
01:48:23,329 --> 01:48:25,082
It does state
that you have a right

1371
01:48:25,164 --> 01:48:27,759
to choose your
own medical care,

1372
01:48:28,167 --> 01:48:32,547
but that is interpreted <i>as
</i> medical care that is approved

1373
01:48:32,715 --> 01:48:34,809
by the Food and
Drug Administration.

1374
01:48:34,966 --> 01:48:39,643
Regarding the FDA, the court is highly
disturbed by its bullying tactics

1375
01:48:40,014 --> 01:48:43,609
and direct interference with
a drug whose own agency

1376
01:48:43,684 --> 01:48:45,606
has found to be non-toxic.

1377
01:48:45,685 --> 01:48:48,529
The FDA was formed
to protect people,

1378
01:48:48,604 --> 01:48:50,948
not prevent them
from getting help.

1379
01:48:51,608 --> 01:48:55,488
The law doesn't seem to make
much common sense sometimes.

1380
01:48:55,904 --> 01:48:59,158
And if a person has been found
to be terminally ill,

1381
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:02,871
they ought to be able to take just
about anything they feel will help,

1382
01:49:04,454 --> 01:49:05,877
but that's not the law.

1383
01:49:06,247 --> 01:49:10,377
Mr. Woodroof, I'm moved to
compassion by your plight,

1384
01:49:10,836 --> 01:49:15,136
but what is lacking here is
legal authority to intervene.

1385
01:49:16,257 --> 01:49:18,931
I'm sorry, this case
is hereby dismissed.

1386
01:49:34,525 --> 01:49:36,869
We <i>lost.</i>

1387
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:44,167
Ladies and gentlemen.

1388
01:49:59,259 --> 01:50:00,475
What?

1389
01:50:30,373 --> 01:50:32,752
Yes, indeed, the
number one spectator event.

1390
01:50:34,377 --> 01:50:36,551
<i>Let me hear you, c'mon.
Whoop it up.</i>

1391
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:40,134
<i>Make some noise! It's your
event, the one you paid to see.</i>

1392
01:50:40,216 --> 01:50:42,685
<i>It's bull-riding time!</i>

1393
01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:45,514
<i>We've got a live one!
The great jawbreaker!</i>

1394
01:50:45,847 --> 01:50:47,520
<i>Number 43, Ron Woodroof!</i>

1395
01:50:47,724 --> 01:50:49,020
<i>Give the man a helping hand.</i>

1396
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:51,944
<i>And now, here's one
of those top bulls,</i>

1397
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:54,773
<i>the one the cowboys
all wanna ride.</i>

1398
01:50:54,856 --> 01:50:57,109
<i>Ain't no denying,
this one means business.</i>

1399
01:50:57,192 --> 01:50:58,944
<i>It's all about the mind.</i>

1400
01:50:59,027 --> 01:51:01,576
<i>An eight second ride.
Let's go, cowboy!</i>

1401
01:51:01,654 --> 01:51:02,655
<i>Pull that rope!</i>

1402
01:51:21,132 --> 01:51:23,180
<i>Clap your hands, stomp your feet!
Make some noise!</i>

1403
01:51:23,551 --> 01:51:26,055
<i>It's bull ride time!</i>

1404
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,078
