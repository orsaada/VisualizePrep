25
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:43,417
What does that mean,
you "ink it"?

26
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:46,319
Well, it means that Holden
draws the pictures in pencil.

27
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:49,290
And then he gives it to me
to go over in ink. Next!

28
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:51,588
So, basically,
you just trace.

29
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:55,961
It's, uh, it's not tracing,
all right?

30
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,933
I add depth and shading to give
the image more deflnition.

31
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:01,834
Only then does the drawing
truly take shape.

32
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:07,171
No, no, no. You go over what he draws
with a pen, all right? That's tracing.

00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:10,110
Not really. Next.

let me ask you somethin'.

35
00:04:15,118 --> 00:04:18,485

outside the original designated art.</i>

watch it with that Urkel shit.

162
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:42,721
Face it, girl.
Archie's a sister.

163
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:49,596
<i>- That's it. You!
- Moi?</i>

164
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:53,539
Yeah, you. You are marching
back across the street with me,

165
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:56,304
and we're gonna pick up
a shitload of Archie books.

166
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:59,278
And I'm going to prove to you
beyond the shadow of a doubt...

167
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:01,872
that Archie
is all about pussy.

168
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:03,849
- Come on!
- [Laughs]

169
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:06,182
This boy is conficted.

170
00:12:07,655 --> 00:12:10,146
I shall play
mother therapist for him.

171
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:13,455
You two sit tight.
We shall return promptly.

172
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:19,198
Is he always like that?

173
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:22,532
Who, him? Yeah.
Ever since the third grade.

174
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:25,595
This, uh, this nun was teaching us
about the Blessed Trinity, you know?

175
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:28,699
She was going on and on about
the three persons in one God thing.

176
00:12:28,776 --> 00:12:30,801
Father, Son,
the Holy Spirit.

177
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:34,541
Banky just goes ballistic on her.
They got in this huge flght.

178
00:12:34,615 --> 00:12:38,210
An eight-year-old kid?
How bad could it have been?

179
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:41,312
Well, have you ever seen a nun call
a small child a "fucking cunt-rag"?

180
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:44,381
It wasn't pretty.
Shit like that's bound to happen...

181
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:47,428
when you make a kid wear
a matching tie and slacks every day.

182
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:51,864
Right. And your parochial
school misadventures?

183
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:55,699
Oh, mostly limited to
wine-tasting prior to mass.

184
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,295
Turned me into a grade school
alcoholic altar boy though.

185
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:00,499
Can't tell you how many mornings
after serious benders...

186
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:02,941
I'd wake up next
to strange priests.

187
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,843
- Aren't you the sharp wit?
- Sharp? No.

188
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:08,905
I'm just a fan of
clergy-molestation humor.

189
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:14,011
Probably why the extended family quit
inviting me to flrst communion parties.

190
00:13:16,257 --> 00:13:18,817
Tsk. You play darts?

191
00:13:18,893 --> 00:13:23,489
Uh, not professionally.
You know, only in bars.

192
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:25,759
<i>[Alyssa]
I don't know.</i>

193
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:29,826
<i>Maybe I should just sign one of those
exclusive deals like you guys.</i>

194
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:31,838
Your new book seems
to be selling like mad.

195
00:13:31,906 --> 00:13:36,639
Well, it all goes back to somethin'
my grandmother told me when I was a kid.

196
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:41,011
"Holden," she said, "the big bucks
are in dick and fart jokes."

197
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,414
- She was a churchgoer.
- Oh!

198
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:47,477
The cry from the heart of a real artist
trapped in commercial hell,

199
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:49,989
pitying his good fortune.

200
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:53,424
I'm sure you can dry your eyes
on all those fat checks you rake in.

201
00:13:53,494 --> 00:13:57,590
Oh, I'm sorry. What was that? Did I
detect a note of bitter envy in there?

202
00:13:57,665 --> 00:14:00,532
No, I'm happy my stuff
gets read at all.

203
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:02,796
There's very little market
for hearts and fowers...

204
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,000
in this spandex-clad, big pecs,
big tits, big guns fleld.

205
00:14:07,074 --> 00:14:10,168
If I sell two issues,
I feel likeJohn Grisham.

206
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:12,212
Well, it's all
about marketing.

207
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,308
Over- or underweight guys that don't
get laid. They're our bread and butter.

208
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:20,616
People like those two outside
should be yours.

209
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:23,623
<i>And sadly, there are more
of our core audience.</i>

210
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:27,286
Kind of gives you a charge though.
See two people like that in love.

211
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:29,659
And all over
Banky's car, no less.

212
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,426
You know, that car's seeing more action
right now than it's seen in years.

213
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,164
- Bubbly guy. It's hard to flgure out.
- Yeah.

214
00:14:37,238 --> 00:14:40,366
You gotta respect that kind of display
of affection. You know what I mean?

215
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:43,001
Sure, it's crazy.
It's rude. It's self-absorbed.

216
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:46,308
But, uh, you know,
it's love.

217
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,349
- It's not love.
- Oh, says you.

218
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:52,409
That out there?
That's feeting.

219
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:55,614
<i>- Fleeting?
- Mm-hmm. Well, I gotta split.</i>

220
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,319
It was really nice meeting you.
Good luck with your book.

221
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:04,228
Tell Hooper I'll call him later.
And... tell your friend to calm down.

222
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:12,338
<i>[Hooper]
Shut up already.</i>

223
00:15:12,406 --> 00:15:15,136
<i>You shut up!
You're insane.</i>

224
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,973
Archie is not fucking
Mr. Weatherbee!

225
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:21,503
Deny, deny, deny.

226
00:15:21,582 --> 00:15:25,575
- Where's Alyssa?
- She left, said she'd call you later.

227
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:28,315
Look, he's just offering to help Archie
with his fuckin' homework!

228
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:30,687
Read between
the lines, bitch.

229
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:34,057
Fuck this. Let's go.
Trafflc.

230
00:15:34,128 --> 00:15:36,688
- Holden!
- What?

231
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:40,860
- Let's go!
- See that dent in the hood of your car?

232
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:42,732
Son of a bitch!

233
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:50,234
Let me guess.
You like her.

234
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:52,711
- Who?
- Miss Alyssa Jones.

235
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:59,280
- She's all right.
- As long as that's all.

236
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,718
<i>.[Rap, Indistinct]</i>

237
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:26,713
This is one of the best streetlights
you've ever drawn.

238
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:28,908
It's the one from across the street
from the post offlce.

239
00:16:28,983 --> 00:16:31,747
- Looks just like it.
- Thanks.

240
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:35,255
So, uh, what do you want
to do tonight?

241
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:38,724
<i>I don't know. Get a pizza.
Watch DegrassiJunior High.</i>

242
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:41,523
You got a weird thing
for Canadian melodrama.

243
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:44,223
I got a weird thing
for girls who say "aboot."

244
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:48,530
- [Phone Rings, Beeps]
- Bank Holdup.

245
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:53,801
Hooper here. Listen, I know how
you 'burb flends hate the city,

246
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:57,275
but there's a club shindig goin' down
tonight I think you'd really get into.

247
00:16:57,345 --> 00:17:01,179
- Where is it?
- Meow Mix. I'm temping as barkeep.

248
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:04,411
Oh, I don't know, Hoop.

249
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:07,318
We're prepping the next issue. We got
that stupid meeting in the morning.

250
00:17:07,388 --> 00:17:10,323
- I told her you wouldn't be interested.
- Told who?

251
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,354
Alyssa.

252
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:15,395
Alyssa from last night Alyssa?

253
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:17,795
How do you begin and end a question
with the same word like that?

254
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:20,800
You got skill.
Yes, that one!

255
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:23,302
She asked me to invite you.
Now, here's the part where you say...

256
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:28,741
- I'll be there.
- Thought so. 10:00. Later.

257
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:34,042
- Who was that?
- Hooper. He invited me to a club.

258
00:17:34,115 --> 00:17:37,744
Man, when's that faggot gonna learn?
You like chicks.

259
00:17:37,818 --> 00:17:40,878
- Not that kind of club.
- So when we leavin'?

260
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:45,085
We? You can't go.
He's hookin' me up with Alyssa.

261
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:48,560
- And?
- And I don't want you messing it up.

262
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:51,996
I care about your shit.
Maybe I'll hook up myself.

263
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:54,364
I told you. It's not
that kind of club.

264
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:58,529
How does one man
get to be so funny?

265
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:03,009
<i>Look, how you gonna get
home when I hook up, huh?</i>

266
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:07,480
- Like that'll happen.
- Let me explain, my witless chum.

267
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:09,880
The other night, we two,
Alyssa and I,

268
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,384
we, uh, well,
we shared a moment.

269
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:15,718
- Oh, you had a moment.
- No.

270
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,520
<i>We shared a moment,
all right?</i>

271
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:24,030
And in that moment, one thing
was made abundantly clear.

272
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:27,534
This girl loves me,
my friend.

273
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:31,332
Loves me. You know
what I'm sayin'?

274
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:33,896
[Humming]
Ah, who's your daddy now

275
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:36,238
Come on. Mmm.
[Humming]

276
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,244
- Ah
- Shut up!

277
00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:42,112
It's your birthday
It's your birthday

278
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:46,618
<i>. Go, Sheila, it's your birthday
Go, Sheila, it's your birthday</i>

279
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:49,952
All right.
Bring on the free hootch.

280
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:53,619
<i>Free? I didn't invite your tired ass.
So, where's your better half?</i>

281
00:18:53,694 --> 00:18:56,788
Takin' a piss. The guy's got
a bladder like an infant.

282
00:18:56,864 --> 00:18:59,662
That's funny. He says
you're hung like an infant.

283
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:02,429
Does his mother
tell him everything?

284
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:05,233
- Hey!
- What'd you do, fall in love?

285
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:07,337
- Where is she?
- Over there.

286
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,498
<i>Look at her in her net shirt. Been
dancin'for an hour. Hasn't stopped yet.</i>

287
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:15,567
She ain't no Deney Terrio,
I'll say that.

288
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:19,581
Listen, if I'm not back by Tuesday,
call my mother. All right?

289
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:23,312
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's somethin' you should know.

290
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:26,048
- She got a boyfriend?
- Well, no.

291
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:30,422
Then what's to know, my friend?
[Grunts] What's to know?

292
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:33,223
<i>.[Rap, Indistinct]</i>

293
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:42,669
Hey, lady! You fucked up
my cabbage patch!

294
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:47,267
Well, well, well, if it isn't Bluntman
himself, or should I call you Chronic?

295
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:51,473
Call me fattered. I heard you sent me
the invite to this little soiree.

296
00:19:51,547 --> 00:19:55,210
From a former hometown girl
to Mr. Hometown himself.

297
00:19:55,284 --> 00:19:57,912
- You're saying you're from the 'burbs?
- Middletown, New Jersey

298
00:19:57,987 --> 00:20:01,286
- Get outta here! I'm from Highlands!
- I know. Hooper told me.

299
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:03,291
How is it that we never
ran into one another?

300
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:05,293
- Did you graduate from Hudson?
- Yeah, '88.

301
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:08,421
- I went to North.
- What a small fuckin' world.

302
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,796
- So you know the tri-town area?
- Quiz me.

303
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:12,858
- Miller Hill?
- I wrote my name on the wall.

304
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:15,597
- Sandy Hook?
- Lost my virginity there.

305
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:19,004
- This is so cool. The mall?
- Eton preppy or Menlo Park?

306
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:22,340
Oh, no. Here's the big test.
Quick Stop?

307
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:25,313
My best friend fucked
a dead guy in the bathroom.

308
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:28,475
- You know that girl?
- I did, before she was committed.

309
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,519
There's a lot of chicks
in this place.

310
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,651
Chicks? You're such a man.

311
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:41,697
You know what this is?
This is fate.

312
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:45,928
No, this is "The Rog."
[Laughs]

313
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:48,562
I'm talking about us meeting.
What are the chances?

314
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:52,335
Pretty slim. I haven't been back
to the 'burbs since my friend's funeral.

315
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:55,309
- The Quick Stop girl died?
- Uh-uh. Another girl.

316
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:57,938
- Julie Dwyer. She died in the...
- The YMCA pool! Damn!

317
00:20:58,014 --> 00:21:00,278
- You knew her too?
- So well.

00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:03,750
Wow! One friend in the asylum,
the other friend in the grave.

319
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,755
- You're a dangerous person to know.
- Ah, but I can tap.

00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:18,097
Two towns away from each other
for years, we had to meet in New York.

<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

328
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:35,441
So, a long time ago, we used
to have this bass player,

329
00:21:35,518 --> 00:21:38,851
who took off one day to draw
funny books or something.

<i>But what a lot of people
don't know...</i>

332
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,765
is that she used to harbor
these delusions that she could sing,

333
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:54,860
and she used to subject us to throaty
renditions of Debbie Gibson tunes.

00:21:57,306 --> 00:22:00,833

and I think if we all beg her...

336
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,572
or maybe offer her
some "X,"

337
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:06,206
she'll come up here and treat us
to some of her vocal stylings.

- What?
- It's rude.

When are we gonna get a chance to see
this shit live without payin' for it?

00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,019
- Sorry. It's just new to him.
- Oh, and you're an old hand at this?

392
00:26:44,091 --> 00:26:49,154
No, no, I should apologize. I don't
normally get all mushy in public,

393
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,256
but it's been a while
since I've seen Kim here.

00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,699
You know what?
I wanna dance.

00:26:57,171 --> 00:26:59,833

399
00:27:13,788 --> 00:27:14,720
Yes?

400
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:17,121
You said "fuck."
She said "fuck."

401
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:19,523
You said "fuck" to that girl.
You said that you'd fuck her.

402
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:22,323
- And?
- How can a girl fuck another girl?

403
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:24,330
Were you talking about
strap-ons or something?

404
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:26,332
- Oh, Jesus. Would you shut up?
- What?

405
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,799
It's okay.

406
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:30,666
I don't know how many times
I can apologize for him.

407
00:27:30,738 --> 00:27:34,299
No, Banky, I've never
used a strap-on.

408
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,309
Then what's with
saying "fuck"?

409
00:27:36,377 --> 00:27:41,007
Shouldn't you say "eat her out" or
modify the term "fuck" with "flst"?

410
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:45,245
Let me ask you a question.
Can men fuck each other?

411
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:49,312
- You asking for my permission?
- In your estimation.

412
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,415
Sure.

413
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:54,950
So, for you,
to fuck is to penetrate.

414
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:57,930
You're used to the more
traditional deflnition.

415
00:27:57,998 --> 00:28:01,695
You, inside some girl you've
duped, jackhammerin' away,

416
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:03,737
not noticing that
bored look in her eyes.

417
00:28:03,804 --> 00:28:08,400
Hey, I always notice that bored look
in their eyes, all right?

418
00:28:08,475 --> 00:28:11,933
Fucking is not limited
to penetration, Banky.

419
00:28:12,012 --> 00:28:16,449
For me, it describes any sex
when it's not totally about love.

420
00:28:16,517 --> 00:28:19,418
I don't love Kim,
but I'll fuck her.

421
00:28:19,486 --> 00:28:21,420
I'm sure you don't love
every girl you sleep with.

422
00:28:21,488 --> 00:28:23,581
Some of them
I downright loathe.

423
00:28:23,657 --> 00:28:27,058
Aha, but I'll bet it's different
with the ones you do love.

424
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:29,061
<i>Like, you'll go down
on 'em longer.</i>

425
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:30,721
- Here we go.
- I don't do that.

426
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:33,995
- What?
- I stopped. It got to be frustrating.

427
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:37,697
As stupid as you usually come off
during this little diatribe of yours,

428
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:39,864
you're gonna come off ten times
as stupid on this occasion.

429
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,909
I lost my tolerance for the baggage
that comes with eating girls out.

430
00:28:42,977 --> 00:28:44,911
What's the big deal?

431
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:47,743
If you say the smell,
so help me, I will slug you.

432
00:28:47,815 --> 00:28:49,840
Not the smell.
The smell is good.

433
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:52,579
I'm talkin' about not being
able to do it properly.

434
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:54,587
My mother
brought me up to believe...

435
00:28:54,655 --> 00:28:57,385
if I can't do something right,
I shouldn't do it at all.

436
00:28:57,458 --> 00:29:00,985
Of course, my father told me she gave
lousy head, but that's beside the point.

437
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:04,497
Well, at least you blame yourself
for your sexual inadequacies.

438
00:29:04,565 --> 00:29:06,795
No. I blame them.

439
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:11,600
Chicks never help you out.
They never tell you what to do, right?

440
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:15,301
And most of them are all self-conscious
about the smell factor.

441
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:19,836
<i>And, so, most of the time, they just lay
there frozen like a deer in headlights.</i>

442
00:29:19,914 --> 00:29:22,542
I mean, not for nothin',
but when a chick goes down on me,

443
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:25,710
I let her know where to go
and what the status is.

444
00:29:25,786 --> 00:29:29,813
You gotta handle it like
CNN and the Weather Channel.

445
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,017
Constant updates.

446
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:34,253
- You are such an idiot.
- [Growls]

447
00:29:34,328 --> 00:29:37,786
No, no, he's got a point.
I mean, that's how I was in high school.

448
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:41,494
You know, all nervous and
inhibited about being eaten out.

449
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:45,026
But by the time I got
to college, that all changed.

450
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:47,198
<i>I've loosened up.</i>

451
00:29:47,274 --> 00:29:49,799
I was like one of those guys at
the airport with those big fashlights,

452
00:29:49,877 --> 00:29:53,813
wavin' 'em this way, directin' 'em
that way, tellin' 'em when to stop.

453
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:57,339
And that's all I'm sayin'. It would
be different if chicks helped out.

454
00:29:57,418 --> 00:29:59,852
You know, pointed a guy
in the right direction.

455
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:05,358
There'd be no bullshit, no wasted time
and no chance for permanent injuries.

456
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:07,360
Permanent injuries?

457
00:30:07,428 --> 00:30:11,023
Sure. You wanna see
somethin' permanent?

458
00:30:11,098 --> 00:30:13,225
- See that?
- Uh-huh.

459
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,064
I got that from Nina Rollins,
sophomore year.

460
00:30:16,136 --> 00:30:18,070
I'm goin' down on her,
right?

461
00:30:18,138 --> 00:30:20,368
<i>- [Moaning]
- Out of nowhere, her cat jumps on her.</i>

462
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:25,845
She does this big pelvic thrust, cracks
my tooth and sends it down my throat.

463
00:30:25,913 --> 00:30:28,882
I had to get a crown
for the stub.

464
00:30:30,217 --> 00:30:33,345
I got that beat.
I got that beat.

465
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:38,289
<i>Junior year, I'm goin'down
on Cynthia Slater in her dorm room.</i>

466
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:43,558
I'm totally drunk, and in the middle
of it, I fall asleep right in her lap.

467
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,564
<i>She got so mad,
she digs her heel into my back.</i>

468
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:49,932
- Ow!
- Right there. That's permanent.

469
00:30:50,004 --> 00:30:53,701
<i>All right. All right.
See this?</i>

470
00:30:55,776 --> 00:30:58,244
That's the farthest I can
move my neck to the right.

471
00:30:58,312 --> 00:31:02,442
Again, sophomore year,
I'm goin' out with Brandy Svining.

472
00:31:02,516 --> 00:31:06,316
And for six months, I'm goin' down
on her. Not a damn thing's happening.

473
00:31:06,387 --> 00:31:10,084
So, one night, I change a position
or vary my lapping speed,

474
00:31:10,157 --> 00:31:14,355
and suddenly it's
a whole new world.

475
00:31:14,428 --> 00:31:17,397
She's movin' around,
convulsing, breathing heavy,

476
00:31:17,464 --> 00:31:20,092
and her legs are pressed up
against my ears so tightly...

477
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:24,069
<i>that I don't hear her father
come into the room.</i>

478
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:27,232
He grabs my hair and
pulls me way back, hard.

479
00:31:32,012 --> 00:31:35,140
Senior year,
spring formal.

480
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:38,150
I'm eatin' out Missy Kurt
in her brother's car.

481
00:31:38,218 --> 00:31:42,678
She's layin' across the backseat. I'm
half hangin' out, knees on the ground.

482
00:31:42,756 --> 00:31:47,625
She's failin' around, and she...
she knocks the parking brake off.

483
00:31:47,694 --> 00:31:52,097
The car starts
rolling down the hill.

484
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:55,329
And my left knee
is cut up to shit...

485
00:31:55,402 --> 00:32:00,999
like a kiddy's scissors class
cut it up for paper dolls!

486
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:08,477
<i>[Laughing Continues]</i>

487
00:32:16,223 --> 00:32:18,191
Whoa! Hey!
Look at the time.

488
00:32:18,258 --> 00:32:20,192
We gotta... We gotta
beat that trafflc, huh?

489
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,490
What trafflc?
It's 1:30 in the morning.

490
00:32:22,563 --> 00:32:26,090
<i>And rush hour
starts in six hours. Let's go.</i>

491
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:30,466
Uh, thanks for inviting us out.
It was educational.

492
00:32:30,537 --> 00:32:32,471
Come on.

493
00:32:37,644 --> 00:32:39,578
Since you like
chicks, right,

494
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:42,308
you just look at yourself naked
in the mirror all the time?

495
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:53,526
<i>[Holden]
Look, here's the deal.</i>

complete Potzer, like last night.</i>

00:32:56,063 --> 00:32:58,031
<i>This is business now, okay?</i>

498
00:32:58,098 --> 00:33:02,432
Oh, why are you in such a bad mood?
Still dwelling on that dyke?

499
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:04,630
- Hey, knock it off, will you?
- What'd I tell you?

500
00:33:04,705 --> 00:33:07,230
She just needs
the right guy.

501
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:12,142
All every woman really wants
is some serious deep-dicking.

502
00:33:12,212 --> 00:33:15,739
<i>- [Phone Ringing]
- Sorry.</i>

503
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:20,252
See, that's why
I can't buy lesbians.

504
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,515
Everyone needs dick.

505
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:25,217
See, I can buy fags,
a bunch of guys that need dick.

506
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:28,159
You know, just plain need it.
That I get.

507
00:33:28,228 --> 00:33:32,062
Dykes?
Bullshit posturing.

508
00:33:32,132 --> 00:33:34,498
But, live and let live,
I guess.

509
00:33:34,568 --> 00:33:37,401
I'm sure the gay community
appreciates your support.

510
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:41,407
We'd like to start off by saying that it
is a real pleasure to flnally meet you.

511
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:43,739
Absolute pleasure.

512
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,677
<i>One of the reasons we started this whole
thing was to filnally meet the guys...</i>

00:33:51,185 --> 00:33:54,552

<i>Look, fellas, the days

517
00:33:57,391 --> 00:34:02,055
<i>We're interested in doing 12 half-hour
Bluntman & Chronic cartoons.</i>

518
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:04,697
<i>What do you say?</i>

519
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,298
Are we in business?

522
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:20,777
Yeah, hi. Somebody told me
they make comic books here,

523
00:34:20,846 --> 00:34:24,475
<i>which is so weird, because I have
this great idea for a story.</i>

524
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,747
It's about a guy who comes
to this club and... [Whistles]

525
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,913
hightails it
when he flnds out...

526
00:34:29,988 --> 00:34:31,580
Ready for this?

527
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:36,624
This girl is gay.

528
00:34:38,764 --> 00:34:42,825
Any interest
in a story like that?

529
00:34:42,901 --> 00:34:45,028
- An animated series?
- Twelve episodes.

530
00:34:45,104 --> 00:34:48,505
- Well, that's great, isn't it?
- Banky seems to think so.

531
00:34:48,574 --> 00:34:51,099
- But you don't.
- Well, I...

532
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:54,168
I don't know if that's the perception
I want people to have of our work.

533
00:34:54,246 --> 00:34:56,339
I know this sounds pretentious
as hell, but...

534
00:34:56,415 --> 00:34:58,542
I'd like to think of us
as artists, you know?

535
00:34:58,617 --> 00:35:01,643
I'd like to get back to doing something
more personal, like our flrst book.

536
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,156
Well, when are you
gonna do that?

537
00:35:05,224 --> 00:35:08,625
When we have something
personal to say.

538
00:35:08,694 --> 00:35:11,185
I weirded you out
the other night.

539
00:35:11,263 --> 00:35:14,027
Uh, no, not really.

540
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:17,091
- Oh, come on!
- Well, it's just...

541
00:35:17,169 --> 00:35:19,399
I'd never seen that kind of thing
up close and personal before.

542
00:35:19,471 --> 00:35:21,439
It just took a while
to process.

543
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:23,532
You wanna talk about it?

544
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:25,702
If you want to.

545
00:35:25,778 --> 00:35:28,576
I like you, Holden.

546
00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:30,945
I haven't liked a man
in a long time.

547
00:35:31,016 --> 00:35:35,680
And it's not because I'm a man-hater
or something like that.

548
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:39,383
<i>/t's just been some time since I've
been exposed to a man that didn't...</i>

549
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:42,985
immediately live into
a stereotype of some sort.

550
00:35:43,061 --> 00:35:45,689
And I want you to feel
comfortable with me,

551
00:35:45,764 --> 00:35:48,756
because I'd really like us
to be friends.

552
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:52,235
So if there's anything you
wanna know, it's okay to ask me.

553
00:35:52,304 --> 00:35:55,535
- Okay.
- Okay.

554
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:58,906
Okay. Why girls?

555
00:36:00,612 --> 00:36:03,809
- Why men?
- Well, because that's the standard.

556
00:36:03,882 --> 00:36:06,908
If that's the only reason
you're attracted to women...

557
00:36:06,985 --> 00:36:09,044
No, it's more than that.

558
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:11,248
So you've never been
curious about men?

559
00:36:11,323 --> 00:36:15,760
<i>Curious? Well, I always wondered
why my father watched Hee Haw, but...</i>

560
00:36:15,828 --> 00:36:18,058
- [Laughs] You know what I mean.
- No.

561
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,064
- Why not?
- No interest.

562
00:36:20,132 --> 00:36:22,896
- Because?
- Girls feel right.

563
00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:27,268
Well, that's how I feel. You know,
I've never really been attracted to men.

564
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:30,900
- Well, so, you're still a virgin then?
- No.

565
00:36:30,976 --> 00:36:32,910
But you've only
been with girls.

566
00:36:32,978 --> 00:36:34,912
So you're saying
a person is a virgin...

567
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,949
until they've had intercourse
with a member of the opposite sex.

568
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,348
Isn't that
the standard deflnition?

569
00:36:40,419 --> 00:36:42,546
Again with your standards.

570
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:46,022
I think virginity is lost
when you make love for the flrst time.

571
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:48,889
- With a member of the opposite sex.
- Why? Why only then?

572
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:51,896
Because that's the standard.
What do you want me to tell ya?

573
00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:56,230
So if a virgin is raped,
then she's still a virgin?

574
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:58,792
- No, of course not.
- But rape is not the standard.

575
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:02,136
So she's had sex, but not
the standard idea of sex.

576
00:37:02,207 --> 00:37:05,040
Hence, according to your deflnition,
she'd still be a virgin.

577
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,908
- Okay, flne, I'll revise.
- Uh-huh.

578
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,074
[Clears Throat] Virginity is
lost when the hymen is broken.

579
00:37:11,149 --> 00:37:14,380
<i>- Then I lost my virginity at ten.
- Really?</i>

580
00:37:14,453 --> 00:37:18,048
'Cause, see, I fell on a fence post
when I was ten, and it broke my hymen.

581
00:37:18,123 --> 00:37:21,183
Okay. Second revision.

582
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,888
Virginity is lost
through penetration.

583
00:37:23,962 --> 00:37:26,328
Physical penetration
or emotional.

584
00:37:26,398 --> 00:37:28,332
- Emotional penetration?
- Mmm.

585
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,494
I fell in love hard with Caitlin Bree
when we were in high school.

586
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,662
Physical penetration.

587
00:37:32,738 --> 00:37:35,400
- We had sex.
- Yeah, but not real sex.

588
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:40,503
I move to have that remark
stricken from the record,

589
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:44,675
on account of it makes you come off
as completely naive and infantile.

590
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,947
Well, where's the penetration
in lesbian sex? I...

591
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,582
A flnger? I've had my flnger up my
ass. I wouldn't say I've had anal sex.

592
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,594
Observe.

593
00:37:59,665 --> 00:38:04,432
You're kidding me!
How?

594
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:07,199
Our bodies are built to pass
a child, for Christ's sake.

595
00:38:07,272 --> 00:38:09,763
<i>Yeah, but I mean...Jesus!
Doesn't that hurt?</i>

596
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:13,140
<i>- Sure, but in that good way.
- Oh.</i>

597
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:17,272
And it's only a once-in-a-while thing
reserved for really special occasions.

598
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:21,445
- How about not-so-special occasions?
- Tongue only.

599
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,785
Well, but see... Come on.
That's what I'm sayin'.

600
00:38:24,856 --> 00:38:28,121
It's like, how can that be enough?
How big can a tongue really get?

601
00:38:32,097 --> 00:38:34,031
My God.

602
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:38,866
[Laughs]
Let's go.

603
00:38:41,273 --> 00:38:43,571
Come on. Come on.

604
00:38:43,642 --> 00:38:46,133
You're really gonna have
to give me a minute, I think.

605

<i>Oh, my God. Who are you?
Larry Fucking Flynt?</i>

609
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,018
- What are you gonna do with all those?
- Read the articles.

610
00:39:01,093 --> 00:39:04,961
What do you think I'm gonna do
with 'em? They're stroke books, stupid.

611
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,022
You got, like, 30 books in there.
We're only gonna be gone for two days.

612
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,933
Variety is the spice of life.
I like a wide selection.

613
00:39:11,003 --> 00:39:13,267
Sometimes I'm in the mood
for nasty close-ups.

614
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:15,636
Sometimes I like 'em
arty and airbrushed.

615
00:39:15,707 --> 00:39:17,971
Sometimes it's a spread
brown-eye kind of night.

616
00:39:18,043 --> 00:39:20,443
<i>- Sometimes it's girl-on-girl time.
- [Beeping]</i>

617
00:39:20,512 --> 00:39:22,446
Sometimes
a steamy letter will do.

618
00:39:22,514 --> 00:39:25,449
Sometimes, not often,
but sometimes...

619
00:39:25,517 --> 00:39:29,783
I like the idea
of a chick with a horse.

620
00:39:29,855 --> 00:39:32,346
Go get our tickets.
I gotta call Alyssa.

621
00:39:32,424 --> 00:39:35,188
- His master's voice.
- Put that stuff away!

622
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:46,437
Hi.

00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:58,313
<i>[Coins Clattering]</i>

624
00:40:03,688 --> 00:40:08,125
[Alyssa] One minute, flve seconds.
Ah, you are such my bitch.

625
00:40:08,193 --> 00:40:10,127
What's up?
I'm about to get on a train.

626
00:40:10,195 --> 00:40:13,392
- Oh! Why?
- Last-minute invite to the Boston Con.

627
00:40:13,465 --> 00:40:17,299
- Shit.
- What?

628
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:20,031
Well, my sister's at my parents',
and I was gonna go see her.

629
00:40:20,105 --> 00:40:22,039
- The one that wrote the book?
- Yeah.

630
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:26,669
But I was stayin' all weekend. I
wanted to hang out with you. This sucks.

631
00:40:26,745 --> 00:40:30,977
You know, um, both of us
don't have to go.

632
00:40:31,049 --> 00:40:33,017
- Really?
- Yeah. Banky can do this by himself.

633
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:36,282
I mean, you know, it's not like we're on
a panel. It's just a signing appearance.

634
00:40:36,354 --> 00:40:39,118
If you come pick me up,
I'll be your best friend.

635
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:41,421
Where's your apartment?

636
00:40:41,493 --> 00:40:45,429
And then Black Beauty
couldn't take it any longer,

637
00:40:45,497 --> 00:40:50,958
and he flnally did
some of his own mounting.

638
00:40:51,036 --> 00:40:53,004
What are you doing?

639
00:40:53,071 --> 00:40:55,232
I think I want kids of my own
one day. They're fun.

640
00:40:55,307 --> 00:40:58,674
Listen to me. I'm not going. You're
gonna have to do this one by yourself.

641
00:40:58,743 --> 00:41:00,734
- What? Why?
- Alyssa's comin' down for the weekend.

642
00:41:00,812 --> 00:41:03,246
I'm gonna hang out with her.
You don't need me for this.

643
00:41:03,315 --> 00:41:06,307
Look, I'll take the bags.
You can, uh, keep the fllth.

I'll pick you up
at 9:00 Sunday night.

Don't forget to plug the annual,
and don't mention the TV show, okay?

646
00:41:11,323 --> 00:41:13,814
Call me if you get bored.

647

All aboard!</i>

on the shore and never played skee-ball?

with your youth?

Not your grade school years,
your high school years.

653
00:41:30,075 --> 00:41:33,602
- This looks complicated.
- Jesus. Potzer, uh...

654
00:41:33,678 --> 00:41:36,306
- The premise is very basic, okay?
- Uh-huh.

655
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:39,509
<i>You roll the ball up the rampart in an
effort to pop it into the score circle.</i>

<i>The higher the score,
the more prize tickets you get.</i>

657
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:43,187
Well, what do you do
with the prize tickets?

658
00:41:43,255 --> 00:41:45,689
You trade them in
for prizes,

659
00:41:45,757 --> 00:41:48,851
which are not worth nearly as much
as you've paid to play the game.

660
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:52,226
- Well, what's the point?
- It's fun.

661
00:41:52,297 --> 00:41:55,130

my lifestyle.

664
00:42:05,977 --> 00:42:08,639
Well, why not just walk up there
and put it in the 50 every time...

665
00:42:08,713 --> 00:42:12,877
- Well, where's the skill in that?
- Oh, this is a skill.

666
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,282
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

667
00:42:15,353 --> 00:42:17,287

This will probably be the flrst time
I don't score afterward.

675
00:42:39,276 --> 00:42:42,211
I don't know. I'm starting to get
a tingle in my bottom.

01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:09,878
You know what I mean.

964
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,443
<i>Why not you?</i>

965
01:03:12,521 --> 01:03:17,652
Well, I'm a guy. I mean...
you're attracted to girls.

966
01:03:17,726 --> 01:03:20,251
I see you've been
taking notes.

967
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:23,526
Historically, yes.
That's true.

968
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,397
Then why this?

969
01:03:30,939 --> 01:03:34,272
Well, I've given that
a lot of thought, you know.

970
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:37,312
Now that I'm being ostracized
by my friends,

971
01:03:37,379 --> 01:03:39,313
I've had plenty of time
to think about it.

972
01:03:39,381 --> 01:03:42,782
<i>And what I've come up with
is really simple.</i>

973
01:03:44,186 --> 01:03:47,519
I came to this
on my own terms.

974
01:03:47,589 --> 01:03:50,490
You know, I didn't just
heed what I was taught:

975
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,427
Men and women should be
together, it's the natural way,

976
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:56,430
that kind of thing.

977
01:03:56,498 --> 01:04:00,730
<i>I'm not with you because of
what family, society, life...</i>

978
01:04:00,802 --> 01:04:04,294
<i>tried to instill in me
from day one.</i>

979
01:04:06,308 --> 01:04:08,606
The way the world is,

980
01:04:08,677 --> 01:04:13,705
how seldom it is that you meet
that one person who...

981
01:04:13,782 --> 01:04:16,342
<i>just gets you.</i>

982
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:18,818
It's so rare.

983
01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:21,981
My parents didn't
really have it.

984
01:04:22,057 --> 01:04:27,518
There were no examples set for me in
the world of male-female relationships.

985
01:04:27,596 --> 01:04:31,760
And to cut oneself off
from flnding that person...

986
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:36,167
to immediately halve your options
by eliminating the possibility...

987
01:04:36,238 --> 01:04:39,935
of flnding that one person
within your own gender...

988
01:04:40,008 --> 01:04:42,135
that just seemed stupid
to me.

989
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:45,043
<i>So I didn't.</i>

990
01:04:45,113 --> 01:04:48,344
But then you came along.

991
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:52,376
You, the one least likely.
I mean, you were a guy.

992
01:04:52,454 --> 01:04:54,888
[Chuckling]
Still am.

993
01:04:54,956 --> 01:05:00,053
And while I was falling for you
I put a ceiling on that,

994
01:05:00,128 --> 01:05:02,926
<i>because you were a guy.</i>

995
01:05:02,998 --> 01:05:07,833
Until I remembered why I opened the door
to women in the flrst place:

996
01:05:07,903 --> 01:05:12,203
To not limit the likelihood
of flnding that one person who'd...

997
01:05:12,274 --> 01:05:14,640
complement me so completely.

998
01:05:18,947 --> 01:05:22,041
So, here we are.

999
01:05:22,117 --> 01:05:24,483
I was thorough
when I looked for you.

1000
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:30,249
And I feel justifled
lying in your arms...

1001
01:05:30,324 --> 01:05:34,021
'cause I got here
on my own terms,

1002
01:05:34,094 --> 01:05:38,861
and I have no question there was
someplace I didn't look.

1003
01:05:38,932 --> 01:05:41,662
For me that makes
all the difference.

1004
01:05:57,885 --> 01:06:00,979
Can I at least tell people all you
needed was some serious deep-dicking?

<i>- Weird nickname. What's your point?
- Do you know why it's "Finger Cuffs"?</i>

1013

Yeah.

1014
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:06,747
Well, asshole, I ran into him
at the stores the other day.

1015
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:09,288
God, it's been ages
since I've seen him.

1016
01:07:09,356 --> 01:07:12,848
- Mentioned you were dating Alyssa.
- Did you?

1017
01:07:12,926 --> 01:07:15,156
Yeah. Funny thing is,
you know what he said?

<i>Shit, I know Alyssa Jones.
I mean, I know Alyssa Jones.</i>

1019
01:07:20,067 --> 01:07:24,163
Me and Rick Derris used to hang
around her house after school...

1020
01:07:24,237 --> 01:07:26,865
and shit, 'cause her parents were,
like, never home and shit, right?

1021
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,670
But one day Rick whips it out and
starts rubbin' it on her leg and shit,

1022
01:07:29,743 --> 01:07:31,904
chasin' her around the living room;
I was dyin'.

1023
01:07:31,979 --> 01:07:34,675
You know what the crazy bitch did?
She fuckin' drops to her knees...

1024
01:07:34,748 --> 01:07:37,615
and starts suckin' him off right in
front of me, like I wasn't even there.

1025
01:07:37,684 --> 01:07:39,982
I almost died.
But that's not the fucked-up part.

1026
01:07:40,053 --> 01:07:44,012
The fucked-up part was Rick, right
in the middle of it, pointin' at her,

1027
01:07:44,091 --> 01:07:46,423
and he says "Cohee,"
just like that, "Cohee."

1028
01:07:46,493 --> 01:07:48,427
So I'm like, "Yo,
I'll give it a shot."

1029
01:07:48,495 --> 01:07:51,293
I start pullin' her pants down and shit,
all slow 'cause I flgure any second...

1030
01:07:51,365 --> 01:07:53,492
she's gonna turn around
and belt me in the mouth, right?

1031
01:07:53,567 --> 01:07:57,059
But she's all into it, man!
She don't try to stop me or nothin'!

1032
01:07:57,137 --> 01:07:59,970
She's all wet and I just start goin'
to work, you know what I'm sayin'?

1033
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,873
Me and Rick are goin' to town on
this crazy bitch, and she's lovin' it,

1034
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,877
all moaning and shit.

1035
01:08:04,945 --> 01:08:06,810
It was fucked-up. So Rick
came up with the nickname.

1036
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,476
That day she had us locked in from
both sides like Chinese flnger cuffs.

1037

He's full of shit.

1038
01:08:12,886 --> 01:08:15,821
Cohee's a lot of things,
but an exaggerator he's not.

- The dude's Catholic.
- She's never even been with a guy.

constitutes "being with a guy."

Look, man. Cohee Lundin is
pulling your chain, okay?

1043
01:08:27,701 --> 01:08:30,795
The fact you even believe him makes you
look like a complete fuckin' idiot.

What if it got out that she's queer as
well? How's that gonna make you look?

1047
01:08:39,513 --> 01:08:42,846
- Well, I give a shit what people think.
- Fuck!

1048
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:46,044
All right.
What if she's carrying a disease?

1049
01:08:46,119 --> 01:08:48,087
- Fuck you!
- What?

1050
01:08:48,155 --> 01:08:51,318
Oh, it's not possible
that she's all crudded-up?

Cohee I can vouch for is clean.
The dude never got laid in high school.

01:22:48,592 --> 01:22:52,790
<i>.I just need you with me</i>

1277
01:22:54,298 --> 01:22:58,758
<i>.Stay, stay, stay with me</i>

1278
01:22:58,836 --> 01:23:03,296
<i>.Stay, stay with me</i>

1279
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:06,775
<i>.Stay and don't you ever
roll away from me</i>

1280
01:23:06,844 --> 01:23:08,311
The girl?

1281
01:23:10,714 --> 01:23:12,648
<i>.Stay</i>

1282
01:23:12,716 --> 01:23:17,016
<i>.Stay with me</i>

1283
01:23:17,088 --> 01:23:19,056
<i>. Oh, and did she ever</i>

1284
01:23:25,863 --> 01:23:29,299
<i>Well, look at this
morose motherfucker right here.</i>

1285
01:23:32,436 --> 01:23:35,928
Smells like someone shit
in his cereal. Nooch.

1286
01:23:36,006 --> 01:23:38,406
What took you guys so long?
What are you, at the mall again?

1287
01:23:38,476 --> 01:23:42,936
Bitch, don't even start, all right?
We stopped that shit years ago.

1288
01:23:43,013 --> 01:23:44,947
Toss the salad.

1289
01:23:45,015 --> 01:23:47,449
[Groans]

1290
01:23:50,888 --> 01:23:53,948
Damn, this likeness rights shit
is more profltable than sellin' smoke.

1291
01:23:55,559 --> 01:23:58,027
How did a dirt merchant like you
ever learn about likeness rights?

1292
01:23:58,095 --> 01:24:01,587
We deal to a lot of lawyers.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1293
01:24:01,665 --> 01:24:05,328
Speaking of which...
A little signin' bonus and shit?

1294
01:24:05,402 --> 01:24:11,204
No, I'll pass.
Did you guys take a look at the issue?

1295
01:24:11,275 --> 01:24:13,835
Yeah.

1296
01:24:13,911 --> 01:24:18,143
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1297
01:24:18,215 --> 01:24:20,342
You need to throw some pussy
in that book, man.

1298
01:24:20,417 --> 01:24:23,250
Like, throw some supervillain
with big fuckin' tits...

1299
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,187
that shoot milk or somethin',
and I'll just, like, suck her dry...

1300
01:24:26,257 --> 01:24:28,885
and bust some moves
on her.

1301
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:36,197
Then she has to fuck me.
I mean, fuck us.

1302
01:24:36,267 --> 01:24:38,827
I'll see what I can do.

1303
01:24:40,804 --> 01:24:44,740
<i>- All right, boys. What'll it be?
- I'm all set, thanks.</i>

1304
01:24:44,808 --> 01:24:48,972
Yo, Flo. Tell Mel to whip me up
a toasted bagel with cream cheese.

1305
01:24:49,046 --> 01:24:54,109
You want one too? Make that two,
and kiss my grits. Nooch.

1306
01:24:55,853 --> 01:24:59,516
<i>Did you ever watch that show, Alice?
That show was funny as hell, man.</i>

1307
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:04,084
<i>So why the long face, horse?
Banky on the rag?</i>

1308
01:25:04,161 --> 01:25:07,392
I'm just, uh... I'm just havin'
a little girl trouble.

1309
01:25:07,464 --> 01:25:10,024
Bitch pressin' charges?
I get that a lot.

1310
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,729
No. I'm just, uh...

1311
01:25:15,172 --> 01:25:17,367
I'm just at a point where
I don't really know what to do.

1312
01:25:17,441 --> 01:25:21,172
Kick her to the fuckin' curb.
Girls get to be too much trouble.

1313
01:25:21,245 --> 01:25:24,408
There's always the band... of the hand.

1314
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:28,783
Can't do it, G.
I'm in love.

1315
01:25:28,852 --> 01:25:32,913
Nah, there ain't no such thing. You
got to boil it down to the essentials.

1316
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:37,757
It's like Cube says: Life ain't
nothin' but bitches and money

1317
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:42,888
Thanks, guys. That's just what I needed.
Advice from the 'hood.

1318
01:25:42,967 --> 01:25:47,631
- So who is this girl?
- Oh, I don't think you know her.

1319
01:25:48,872 --> 01:25:51,705
<i>Come on, man.
I'm people who know people.</i>

1320
01:25:51,775 --> 01:25:53,709
You sound
like Barbra Streisand.

1321
01:25:53,777 --> 01:25:56,541
Maybe 'cause I got this tubby bitch
playin' her greatest hits tape...

1322
01:25:56,614 --> 01:25:58,548
in my ear all the time.

1323
01:25:58,616 --> 01:26:02,848
You gotta see it. When she starts
singin' "You Don't Bring Me Flowers,"

1324
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:06,048
this faggot starts cryin' like a little
girl with a skinned knee and shit.

1325
01:26:06,123 --> 01:26:09,991
Big fuckin' softie.
So what's the skirt's name?

1326
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,460
I'm tellin' ya, man.
You don't know the girl.

1327
01:26:12,529 --> 01:26:16,829
I ain't playin', man.
Come on, tell me her name, Mysterio.

1328
01:26:18,535 --> 01:26:20,469
Alyssa Jones.

1329
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:25,641
Holy fuckin' shit.
Finger Cuffs?

1330
01:26:25,709 --> 01:26:30,373
<i>You're dating Finger Cuffs,
you silly son of a bitch?</i>

1331
01:26:30,447 --> 01:26:32,642
Wait a second.
I thought she was all gay and shit.

1332
01:26:32,716 --> 01:26:35,617
She was, or she is.
I don't know.

1333
01:26:35,686 --> 01:26:38,780
And you're dating her.
Man, you're a lucky fuck.

1334
01:26:38,856 --> 01:26:40,790
She ever bring bitches to bed
with you?

1335
01:26:40,858 --> 01:26:43,053
Get a little of that
Filet-O-Fish sandwich goin' on?

1336
01:26:43,127 --> 01:26:45,652
Yeah, you know what
I'm talkin' about, baby. Right?

1337
01:26:45,729 --> 01:26:49,597
What's up? Yeah.
So four tits and what?

1338
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:53,364
- No, man. It's not like that.
- What's it like, then?

1339
01:26:53,437 --> 01:26:57,305
Right now?
I don't know.

1340
01:26:57,374 --> 01:27:00,366
I love her, you know?
But, uh, she has a past.

1341
01:27:00,444 --> 01:27:04,346
I'll say. Stuffln' two guys,
eatin' chicks out and shit.

1342
01:27:04,415 --> 01:27:06,713
You know, I heard
one time she had this dog...

1343
01:27:06,784 --> 01:27:09,981
Eat your fuckin' bagel already
and shut up.

1344
01:27:10,054 --> 01:27:13,990
Look at this touchy
motherfucker right here.

1345
01:27:14,058 --> 01:27:16,526
So if you're all in love and shit,
what's the problem?

1346
01:27:16,593 --> 01:27:20,256
The problem is
stupid shit like that.

1347
01:27:20,331 --> 01:27:22,162
It was bad enough when it was
just girls, you know?

1348
01:27:22,232 --> 01:27:26,168
You throw guys into the mix...
two guys at once, no less...

1349
01:27:26,236 --> 01:27:29,330
All that experience, you know?
What am I supposed to think?

1350
01:27:29,406 --> 01:27:34,343
Think "good," ya fuckin' ninny shithead,
'cause now she'll be all true and blue.

1351
01:27:34,411 --> 01:27:39,246
Bitch tasted life. Now she's settlin'
for your borin' funny-book-makin' ass.

1352
01:27:39,316 --> 01:27:42,513
Settling for my boring ass.
That's comforting. Thanks, Jay.

1353
01:27:42,586 --> 01:27:47,580
- That's what I'm here for.
- I'm just havin' a problem with it.

1354
01:27:47,658 --> 01:27:51,856
It's like I can't get these visuals out
of my head of her doing all this shit.

1355
01:27:51,929 --> 01:27:56,332
And I don't know why I can't let
it go, 'cause I'm crazy about this girl.

1356
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:00,427
- I look at her, I see kids, grandkids...
- You're scarin' me.

1357
01:28:00,504 --> 01:28:03,132
Yeah, well, I'm scarin' myself
'cause I think so much of this girl...

1358
01:28:03,207 --> 01:28:06,233
that I can't get stupid shit
like "Finger Cuffs" out of my head.

1359
01:28:07,878 --> 01:28:11,609
[Sighs] I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doin'.

1360
01:28:15,152 --> 01:28:17,086
Chasin' Amy.

1361
01:28:18,922 --> 01:28:22,085
What?
What did you say?

1362
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:24,218
[Spits]

1363
01:28:24,294 --> 01:28:27,457
- You're chasing Amy.
- What do you look so shocked for, man?

1364
01:28:27,531 --> 01:28:31,490
<i>Fat bastard does this all the time. He
thinks 'cause he don't say anything...</i>

1365
01:28:31,568 --> 01:28:34,230
it'll have some huge impact
when he does open his fuckin' mouth.

1366
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:36,238
Jesus Christ,
why don't you shut up?

1367
01:28:36,306 --> 01:28:40,743
Always yap-yap-yapping all the time.
Give me a fuckin' headache.

1368
01:28:40,811 --> 01:28:43,644
I went through somethin' like what
you're talkin' about a couple years ago.

1369
01:28:43,714 --> 01:28:46,012
- This chick named Amy.
- When?

1370
01:28:47,418 --> 01:28:49,648
A couple of years ago.

1371
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,915
What, she live in Canada or something?
Why don't I remember this?

1372
01:28:51,989 --> 01:28:53,957
<i>Bitch, what you don't
know about me...</i>

1373
01:28:54,024 --> 01:28:55,958
I could just about squeeze
in the Grand-fucking-Canyon.

1374
01:28:56,026 --> 01:29:00,429
Did you know I always wanted to be
a dancer in Vegas? Huh?

1375
01:29:00,497 --> 01:29:04,228
Bet you didn't even know
that shit, did you?

1376
01:29:04,301 --> 01:29:07,134
Just tell your fuckin' story so
we can get out of here and smoke this.

1377
01:29:08,906 --> 01:29:13,775
So there's me and Amy. And we're
inseparable. Just big-time in love.

1378
01:29:13,844 --> 01:29:16,779
Then four months down the road
the idiot gear kicks in,

1379
01:29:16,847 --> 01:29:20,305
and I ask about the ex-boyfriend which,
as we all know, is a really dumb move.

1380
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:23,785
<i>But you know how it is: You don't want
to know, but you just have to know.</i>

1381
01:29:23,854 --> 01:29:25,788
Stupid guy bullshit.

1382
01:29:25,856 --> 01:29:28,347
So, anyway, she starts
tellin' me about him.

1383
01:29:28,425 --> 01:29:32,725
They fell in love, went out for
a couple of years, lived together.

1384
01:29:32,796 --> 01:29:36,698
Her mother likes me better,
blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm okay.

1385
01:29:36,767 --> 01:29:39,793
<i>But then she drops the bomb on me,
and the bomb is this.</i>

1386
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:43,169
It seems that a couple of times,
while they were goin' out,

1387
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,538
he brought some people
to bed with them.

1388
01:29:45,609 --> 01:29:47,975
Menage a trois,
I believe it's called.

1389
01:29:48,045 --> 01:29:51,537
Now this just blows my mind, right?
I'm not used to this sort of thing.

1390
01:29:51,615 --> 01:29:55,984
- I was raised Catholic, for God's sakes.
- Saint Shithead.

1391
01:29:56,053 --> 01:29:57,987
Do somethin'.

1392
01:29:58,055 --> 01:30:01,320
So I'm totally weirded out by this,
right? And I just start blastin' her.

1393
01:30:01,391 --> 01:30:04,155
I don't know how to deal with what I'm
feelin', so I flgure the best way is...

1394
01:30:04,228 --> 01:30:07,220
if call her "slut," right,
and tell her she was used.

1395
01:30:07,297 --> 01:30:10,357
I'm out for blood.
I really want to hurt this girl.

1396
01:30:10,434 --> 01:30:14,302
"What the fuck is your problem?"
And she's just calmly trying to tell me,

1397
01:30:14,371 --> 01:30:18,307
"It was that time, that place," and she
doesn't think she should apologize...

1398
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:20,468
because she doesn't feel
that she's done anything wrong.

1399
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:25,345
I'm like, "Oh, really?" I look her in
the eye and tell her it's over. I walk.

1400
01:30:27,149 --> 01:30:29,242
Fuckin' A.

1401
01:30:29,318 --> 01:30:32,048
No, idiot.
It was a mistake.

1402
01:30:32,121 --> 01:30:34,180
I wasn't disgusted with her,
I was afraid.

1403
01:30:34,256 --> 01:30:38,022
<i>You know, at that moment I felt small,
like I'd lacked experience,</i>

1404
01:30:38,093 --> 01:30:42,621
like I'd never be on her level, never be
enough for her or something like that.

1405
01:30:42,698 --> 01:30:46,134
But what I did not get,
she didn't care.

1406
01:30:46,201 --> 01:30:50,763
She wasn't lookin' for that guy anymore,
she was lookin' for me, for the Bob.

1407
01:30:50,839 --> 01:30:56,038
But by the time I flgured this all
out, it's too late, man. She moved on.

1408
01:30:56,111 --> 01:30:59,945
<i>All I had to show for it was foolish
pride which then gave way to regret.</i>

1409
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:05,884
She was the girl.
I know that now.

1410
01:31:05,954 --> 01:31:08,752
But...

1411
01:31:10,325 --> 01:31:12,850
I pushed her away.

1412
01:31:18,867 --> 01:31:23,167
So I've spent every day
since then chasing Amy.

1413
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,208
So to speak.

1414
01:31:27,276 --> 01:31:32,043
Enough of this fuckin' melodrama.
My advice? Forget her, dude.

1415
01:31:32,114 --> 01:31:36,517
There's one bitch in the world,
one bitch with many faces.

1416
01:31:36,585 --> 01:31:41,113
Get up, tons of fun.
We gotta book.

1417
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:44,921
<i>- Catchin'a bus to Chi-town.
- Why? What's there?</i>

1418
01:31:44,993 --> 01:31:48,724
Business, yo. How many more of those
fat envelopes we get comin' to us?

1419
01:31:48,797 --> 01:31:51,630
Uh, I don't know.

1420
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:54,168
I don't know how much longer
the book's gonna be around.

1421
01:31:54,236 --> 01:31:57,330
Yeah, good.
I'll be glad as shit when it's gone.

1422
01:31:57,406 --> 01:32:01,570
There's a million people who'd love
to see themself in a comic book.

1423
01:32:01,643 --> 01:32:04,373
But that ain't like us at all,
all slapsticky and shit,

1424
01:32:04,446 --> 01:32:06,107
runnin' around like
a couple of dickheads.

1425
01:32:06,181 --> 01:32:09,082
Sayin'... What's that shit
he got us sayin'?

1426
01:32:09,151 --> 01:32:12,484
Oh, um...

1427
01:32:12,554 --> 01:32:17,958
"Snootchie-bootchies." Who the fuck
talks like that? That is baby talk.

1428
01:32:19,695 --> 01:32:22,892
It's a big world, G.
We're bound to run into you again.

1429
01:32:22,965 --> 01:32:26,833
- Till then, keep your unit on ya.
- I'll try.

1430
01:32:26,902 --> 01:32:30,360
No, no, no, no, no.
Do or do not. There is no try...

1431
01:32:30,439 --> 01:32:34,739
Knock that shit off!
We got a bus to catch.

1432
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:38,769
Jedi bitch. Man, what do you always have
to tell that fuckin' gay story for?

1433
01:32:38,847 --> 01:32:40,747
<i>- Man, shut up.
- You shut up, you fat fuck.</i>

1434
01:33:30,032 --> 01:33:32,000
Okay.

1435
01:33:32,067 --> 01:33:36,629
You guys are probably wondering
why I asked you here at the same time...

1436
01:33:36,705 --> 01:33:40,436
knowing that we have shit
to settle between us separately.

1437
01:33:40,509 --> 01:33:43,774
I just flgured you wanted
to kill two birds with one stone.

1438
01:33:43,845 --> 01:33:46,678
You know, by telling her
to fuck off with me here...

1439
01:33:46,748 --> 01:33:49,216
so you wouldn't have to
go through the story again later on.

1440
01:33:49,284 --> 01:33:52,685
- Fuck you.
- Not even if you let me videotape it.

1441
01:33:52,754 --> 01:33:55,746
Okay, enough.
All right?

1442
01:33:57,159 --> 01:34:00,185
Enough.
[Sighs]

1443
01:34:00,262 --> 01:34:04,221
Now, I've been going over and
over and over this whole thing,

1444
01:34:04,299 --> 01:34:06,927
and I've dissected it
a thousand different ways.

1445
01:34:07,002 --> 01:34:10,699
Banky, there's tension between you and I
for the flrst time in our lives.

1446
01:34:10,772 --> 01:34:15,539
You hate me dating Alyssa and you want
me to sign off on this cartoon thing.

1447
01:34:15,611 --> 01:34:17,772
How perceptive.

1448
01:34:17,846 --> 01:34:22,078
Alyssa,

1449
01:34:22,150 --> 01:34:24,209
you and I have hit a wall...

1450
01:34:24,286 --> 01:34:28,746
'cause I don't know how to deal
with your, uh, your past, I guess.

1451
01:34:28,824 --> 01:34:30,758
That's a nice way
of putting it.

1452
01:34:30,826 --> 01:34:32,817
I'd have said
"the whole double stuff' thing.

1453
01:34:39,401 --> 01:34:42,996
I'm only gonna
tell you this once: Shut up.

1454
01:34:45,407 --> 01:34:47,341
<i>Now,
[Sighs]</i>

1455
01:34:47,409 --> 01:34:51,470
I know I'm to blame one way
or another on both accounts.

1456
01:34:51,546 --> 01:34:55,505
Alyssa, with you
because... I feel inadequate,

1457
01:34:55,584 --> 01:34:58,815
<i>because you've had such a big life
and so much experience,</i>

1458
01:34:58,887 --> 01:35:01,617
and my life's been
pretty small in comparison.

1459
01:35:01,690 --> 01:35:04,887
- That doesn't matter to me.
- Please.

1460
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,259
I have to get
through this, okay?

1461
01:35:08,330 --> 01:35:13,097
Banky, I know why you're having such
a hard time with me and Alyssa.

1462
01:35:13,168 --> 01:35:16,103
<i>/t's something that's been
obvious forever and I guess...</i>

1463
01:35:16,171 --> 01:35:19,334
I guess I just didn't
acknowledge it.

1464
01:35:20,909 --> 01:35:22,843
You're in love with me.

1465
01:35:25,113 --> 01:35:27,047
What?

1466
01:35:27,115 --> 01:35:31,916
You're attracted to me. Just as, in
a way, I guess I'm... attracted to you.

1467
01:35:31,987 --> 01:35:34,683
It makes sense. We've been together
so long, we have so much in common.

1468
01:35:34,756 --> 01:35:37,691
Well, I gotta get goin'.

1469
01:35:37,759 --> 01:35:40,319
<i>I gotta catch the last few minutes
of Little House.</i>

1470
01:35:48,904 --> 01:35:51,566
It's somethin' you're
gonna have to deal with, Bank.

1471
01:35:53,041 --> 01:35:55,271
And that would explain
your jealousy of Alyssa,

1472
01:35:55,344 --> 01:35:58,006
your homophobia,
your sense of humor...

1473
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,844
Jesus, just 'cause a guy's
got a predilection toward dick jokes...

1474
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:03,612
Bank. Stop.

1475
01:36:03,685 --> 01:36:06,711
Deal with it.
You'll feel much better.

1476
01:36:09,091 --> 01:36:11,321
<i>[Holden]
Okay.</i>

1477
01:36:16,365 --> 01:36:20,267
Now, you guys are probably
asking yourselves the same question...

1478
01:36:20,335 --> 01:36:24,294
that I've been going over and over
in my head the past few weeks:

1479
01:36:24,373 --> 01:36:26,307
What does one have
to do with the other?

1480
01:36:26,375 --> 01:36:27,603
Don't.

1481
01:36:27,676 --> 01:36:31,237
And when I did some
serious soul-searching,

1482
01:36:31,313 --> 01:36:33,577
it came to me
from outta nowhere.

1483
01:36:33,648 --> 01:36:38,745
And it all made sense.
And a calm came over me.

1484
01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:41,880
I know what we have to do.

1485
01:36:41,957 --> 01:36:46,223
And then you, Banky,
you, Alyssa, and I...

1486
01:36:46,294 --> 01:36:51,231
all of us...
can flnally be... all right.

1487
01:36:51,299 --> 01:36:53,529
Please don't say it.

1488
01:36:56,138 --> 01:36:59,073
We've all gotta
have sex together.

1489
01:37:08,383 --> 01:37:10,317
I mean, look,
don't you see?

1490
01:37:10,385 --> 01:37:14,116
That would take care
of everything.

1491
01:37:14,189 --> 01:37:17,215
Alyssa, with you, I won't feel
too inadequate or conservative anymore,

1492
01:37:17,292 --> 01:37:20,489
because I'll have done something
on a par with all your experience.

1493
01:37:20,562 --> 01:37:25,261
And it will be with you, which will
make it that much more powerful.

1494
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:27,267
Banky, you can take that leap...

1495
01:37:27,335 --> 01:37:29,667
that everyone else but you
sees you should take.

1496
01:37:29,738 --> 01:37:33,105
And it'll be with me,
your best friend for years.

1497
01:37:33,175 --> 01:37:35,143
We've been everything to each other
but intimates,

1498
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:37,804
and now we'll have been
through that together too.

1499
01:37:37,879 --> 01:37:40,643
And it won't be a total leap for you
because a woman will be involved.

1500
01:37:40,715 --> 01:37:44,811
And when it's over, all that hostility
you feel toward Alyssa will be gone...

1501
01:37:44,886 --> 01:37:47,684
because you'll have shared in something
beautiful with the woman I love.

1502
01:37:47,756 --> 01:37:50,486
<i>/t'll be cathartic.</i>

No? I thought
you'd be into this.

1514

You did?
What does that say about me?

1515
01:39:07,467 --> 01:39:10,561
Sweetheart, you've done stuff
like this before.

1516
01:39:10,637 --> 01:39:12,571
This should be
no big deal for you.

1517
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:17,008
You don't want this.
You really don't want this.

1518
01:39:17,077 --> 01:39:22,777
<i>No, I do want this. This has
to happen. Can't you see that?</i>

1519
01:39:22,849 --> 01:39:27,445
<i>I mean, how can you not? No?
What does that say about me?</i>

1520
01:39:27,521 --> 01:39:29,853
You can take it from two guys
whose names you can hardly remember,

1521
01:39:29,923 --> 01:39:34,121
but I ask you to share an experience
about intimacy, and you say no?

1522
01:39:34,194 --> 01:39:38,688
- I can't.
- Baby, yes, you can.

1523
01:39:38,765 --> 01:39:42,997
I'll be there. And when it's over we'll
be the strongest we've ever been...

1524
01:39:43,069 --> 01:39:45,003
'cause we'll have been
through this together.

1525
01:39:45,071 --> 01:39:49,064
Then we'll be on the same level and
there'll be nothing we can't accomplish.

Oh, Holden.

1527
01:39:54,614 --> 01:39:56,775
That time is over for me.

1528

I've been there
and I've done it...

1529
01:39:58,852 --> 01:40:02,754

what I was looking for in any of it.

1530

I found that it you.
In us.

1531
01:40:06,826 --> 01:40:10,489
Doing this won't help you forget
about the things you're hung up on.

1532
01:40:10,564 --> 01:40:14,967
- It'll create more.
- No. I've thought about all that.

1533
01:40:15,035 --> 01:40:18,004
Yes, it will!

1534

differently from then on.

with it once you're in the moment.

Maybe I'll moan differently,

1537
01:40:32,385 --> 01:40:36,287
and then you'll resent Banky
and become suspicious of us.

1538
01:40:36,356 --> 01:40:39,348
Or you'll alienate him
because of it.

1539
01:40:39,426 --> 01:40:45,092
You'll grow to blame and hate me for
the deterioration of your friendship.

1540

Or what if... and God,
I sincerely doubt it...

1541
01:40:48,468 --> 01:40:52,632

in Banky that I've never seen before,

1547
01:41:15,095 --> 01:41:19,930
But I've had
those experiences, on my own.

1548
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,561

would want to share me with anyone.

1587
01:44:41,201 --> 01:44:43,897
<i>Oh, like the door to death
in Baby Dave's Winter Special,</i>

1588
01:44:43,970 --> 01:44:45,904
<i>which you did on your own.</i>

1589
01:44:45,972 --> 01:44:50,204
<i>See? You don't need that McNeil guy,
anyway. You do great work on your own.</i>

1590
01:44:50,276 --> 01:44:54,372
<i>Look at your line work. Look at all the
detail in this douche bag on page 18.</i>

1591
01:44:54,447 --> 01:44:56,210
Look at how you draw a fart.

1592
01:44:56,282 --> 01:44:59,615
<i>And tell me you're not better off
without Holden McNeil.</i>

1593
01:44:59,686 --> 01:45:02,280
<i>I mean, you were just carrying
that guy like a brown-bag lunch,</i>

1594
01:45:02,355 --> 01:45:04,289
<i>you know what I'm saying?</i>

1595
01:45:04,357 --> 01:45:08,123
<i>- You're so right.
- Yeah, well, the true fans always are.</i>

1596
01:45:08,194 --> 01:45:13,188
<i>Well, keep up the good work, man.
Love those dick jokes. Love 'em.</i>

1597
01:45:15,535 --> 01:45:17,469
<i>See ya.</i>

1598
01:45:19,973 --> 01:45:21,907
Yeah.

1599
01:45:24,210 --> 01:45:26,144
Bye.

1600
01:45:37,891 --> 01:45:40,086
Okay. Who's next?

1601
01:45:41,861 --> 01:45:43,795
<i>Hi.</i>

1602
01:45:50,003 --> 01:45:52,904
Thanks for readin' it.

1603
01:45:52,972 --> 01:45:55,964
I can't believe this place.
These people are so weird.

1604
01:45:56,042 --> 01:45:57,976
You wanted to come.

1605
01:45:58,044 --> 01:46:00,376
God, I can't believe you call
these people contemporaries.

1606
01:46:00,446 --> 01:46:03,006
Look at this guy over here
with the pointy ears? What's that?

1607
01:46:03,082 --> 01:46:05,016
- He's a Vulcan.
- A what?

1608
01:46:05,084 --> 01:46:07,450
- A Vulcan. Jesus, potzer.
- [Laughs]

1609
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,011
Why don't you take a walk
and get us something to drink?

1610
01:46:10,089 --> 01:46:11,522
Okay, I will.

1611
01:46:30,408 --> 01:46:32,433
Um, this isn't
one of mine.

1612
01:46:32,510 --> 01:46:34,444
<i>/t's mine.</i>

1613
01:46:36,081 --> 01:46:38,276
I saved you a copy.

1614
01:46:41,553 --> 01:46:43,487
Hi.

1615
01:46:43,555 --> 01:46:45,489
Hi.

1616
01:46:45,557 --> 01:46:47,889
How've you been?

1617
01:46:47,959 --> 01:46:52,396
Uh, good. Really good.
Yourself?

1618
01:46:52,464 --> 01:46:54,398
Good.

1619
01:47:01,106 --> 01:47:04,701
The new issue's selling
like crazy, for some reason.

1620
01:47:04,776 --> 01:47:08,507
Yeah, well, it's because it's
really good. I liked it a lot.

1621
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:10,514
Thank you.

1622
01:47:13,118 --> 01:47:15,814
I haven't even seen this yet.
Did it just come out?

1623
01:47:15,887 --> 01:47:19,414
Uh, oh, about a month ago.
I did a really small run.

1624
01:47:19,491 --> 01:47:21,584
Self-flnanced,
only about 500 issues.

1625
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:24,322
Will I enjoy it?

1626
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:28,021
You might.
It's familiar subject matter.

1627
01:47:45,550 --> 01:47:49,350
Looks like
a very personal story.

1628
01:47:52,490 --> 01:47:56,586
[Sighs] I flnally had
something personal to say.

1629
01:48:01,599 --> 01:48:05,126
Well, I'm gonna go.
I don't wanna hold up your line here.

1630
01:48:05,203 --> 01:48:07,763
Yeah.

1631
01:48:07,839 --> 01:48:11,775
I mean, it can get ugly. I just saw
this nun call a small child a cunt-rag.

1632
01:48:11,843 --> 01:48:13,777
[Chuckles]

1633
01:48:20,218 --> 01:48:22,618
You know, read that,
if you have a minute.

1634
01:48:22,687 --> 01:48:25,155
I will.

1635
01:48:28,893 --> 01:48:33,796
If you get the chance, call me. I'd like
to hear your thoughts, or... whatever.

1636
01:48:33,865 --> 01:48:36,629
Okay.

1637
01:48:38,203 --> 01:48:40,137
Okay.

1638
01:48:42,474 --> 01:48:44,601
It was really nice
seeing you again.

1639
01:48:44,676 --> 01:48:47,907
It was really nice
to see you too.

1640
01:49:01,426 --> 01:49:04,725
- Who was that?
- Huh?

1641
01:49:04,796 --> 01:49:06,661
<i>Who was that?</i>

1642
01:49:16,574 --> 01:49:20,670
Oh, just some guy I knew.

1643
01:49:33,992 --> 01:49:37,792
Next. So, what do you want
to do tonight?

1644
01:49:39,097 --> 01:49:44,592
<i>.I was tappin'my foot
on a Friday night</i>

1645
01:49:44,669 --> 01:49:49,629
<i>. To my favorite band
I was pushed aside</i>

1646
01:49:49,707 --> 01:49:54,644
<i>.I said hey, don't push me
No, no, no one pushes me</i>

1647
01:49:54,712 --> 01:49:59,649
<i>. When I was face to face
with a woman I admired</i>

1648
01:49:59,717 --> 01:50:02,186
<i>.And she gave me this look</i>

1649
01:50:02,319 --> 01:50:04,651
<i>I could not believe</i>

1650
01:50:04,721 --> 01:50:09,852
<i>.And the cold stare remained
I wanted to leave</i>

1651
01:50:12,262 --> 01:50:17,529
<i>. Yeah, I do believe anger
is offset by sorrow</i>

1652
01:50:17,601 --> 01:50:22,402
<i>.But you destroy today
you might regret tomorrow</i>

1653
01:50:22,472 --> 01:50:25,100
<i>. When you're young
and defensive</i>

1654
01:50:25,175 --> 01:50:27,507
<i>. It comes off offensive</i>

1655
01:50:27,578 --> 01:50:32,481
<i>.And it's hard to repay the
tolerance that you borrowed</i>

1656
01:50:32,549 --> 01:50:37,714
<i>. The lasting relationship
sinks right off the pier</i>

1657
01:50:37,788 --> 01:50:42,384
<i>. Who wears the pants
/t's faded but clear</i>

1658
01:50:44,895 --> 01:50:49,332
<i>.She's your girlfriend
and she ain't too fond of me</i>

1659
01:50:49,399 --> 01:50:55,099
<i>.I guess if that's the way
it was meant to be</i>

1660
01:50:55,172 --> 01:51:00,075
<i>. There we were
just we three</i>

1661
01:51:00,143 --> 01:51:03,806
<i>. You, your girlfriend and me</i>

1662
01:51:26,903 --> 01:51:31,840
<i>.I've known you forever
You two just met</i>

1663
01:51:31,908 --> 01:51:36,470
<i>.So easily amused
how fast we forget</i>

1664
01:51:36,546 --> 01:51:41,677
<i>.Ain't my jealousy
my self-righteous greed</i>

1665
01:51:41,752 --> 01:51:46,519
<i>.She's a bit like a book
I'm too farsighted to read</i>

1666
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:51,584
<i>.And I wish you the best
but sometimes feel the need</i>

1667
01:51:51,662 --> 01:51:55,860
<i>. To say
Remember me</i>

1668
01:51:58,368 --> 01:52:03,772
<i>. Yeah, she's your girlfriend
as far as we can see</i>

1669
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:08,743
<i>.Does she look at you
the way she looks at me</i>

1670
01:52:08,812 --> 01:52:13,909
<i>.And here we are
just we three</i>

1671
01:52:13,984 --> 01:52:18,478
<i>. You, your girlfriend and me</i>

1672
01:52:20,791 --> 01:52:25,626
<i>.She's your girlfriend
it's gettin'harder to see</i>

1673
01:52:25,696 --> 01:52:30,497
<i>.Better just take her home
Better just let her be</i>

1674
01:52:30,567 --> 01:52:35,766
<i>. When she walks out that door
you come looking for me</i>

1675
01:52:49,886 --> 01:52:52,411
<i>[Jay] Man, what do you always have
to tell that fuckin'gay story for?</i>

1676
01:52:52,489 --> 01:52:55,083
<i>- [Silent Bob] Man, shut up.
- You shut up, you fat fuck.</i>
