Okay. Let's see where we are.

We could move this, get
rid of that, kill that.

4
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:27,491
That kind of freaks me out.
Don't need her. We can get rid of that.

That's done. Okay,
we could start with this.

come on, you guys, it's the Internet.

She does, right?

which means it means a lot to me.

of being late, just shit on my face.

work. I'm sorry.

Maybe you should care a
little bit less about work

66

and a little more about the
girl that you're dating.

Not your issue any more.

how to break up with me?

research.

89

Okay. You want someone to
sweep you off your feet,

90
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,560
but you're more interested in
getting swept off your feet

91

than the someone who's
doing the sweeping.

got it totally together,

really emotionally damaged.

hits last month.

172
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,921
I could put up a video of me
mixing cake batter with my boobs

173
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,547

eight million hits.

Well, look, there's no question that
you are talented at what you do,

177
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,519
but this is GQ.

178
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,441
New York's so crowded.

179
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,566
Look around. I'm from LA, okay?

180
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,782
I like my open spaces.
What are you, a gazelle?

181
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,075
Come on, what's really
worrying you about this?

182
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:10,202
I don't know. I don't want to be the
guy who took something legendary

183
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,034
and shit the bed with it.
Excuse the expression.

184
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,087
Well, then don't be the guy who shit the bed.
Excuse the expression.

185
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,254
Be the guy who made
the bed legendary again.

186
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,591
Listen, we'll get some coffee in you
before the interview. You'll be fine.

187

I'm sorry, not coffee.

189
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,558
Doesn't it get hot in LA?

190
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,514
Yeah, it gets hot in LA,
but it's the humidity.

191
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,396
In LA, if it's 90 degrees, it
feels like 90 degrees. But...

192
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,936
Right. If it's hot in New York,

193
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,900
it's 90 degrees, it's
like 100,000 degrees.

194
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,152
This conversation about weather
is really fascinating,

195
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,983
but lucky for me, we are here.

196
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,490
So, good luck.

197
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,119
Whatever happens, happens.
I told you, I don't really want it.

198
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,411
Just do me a favor?
Act like you do so that I look good.

199
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,791
I can do that.
Okay. Go get 'em.

200
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,255

Yeah. Well, it's my job.

Nice.

207
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,278
So, tell me, how'd it go?

208
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,239
They bought it.
You're safe for a little while longer.

expires at midnight.

me instead of texting me?

It's amazing.

It's a huge move.

Would you uproot your entire
life for a job? Be honest.

221
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,985
Well, no. For a job,
probably not.

222
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,986

Yeah, I would.

know what he'd say.

You're just threatened by him

710

anything was just so...

Why didn't I
notice that before?

761
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,050

meant you had a normal family,

desperately wanted.

00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,607
I mean, nice, but it was
like talking to dirt.

855
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,444
I woke up one day and I said, "Lorna...
" I'm Lorna.

856
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:00,281
Dylan. I said, "Lorna,
this is not your bliss."

857
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,366
"Just because you're 39...
" Forty-eight.

858
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,070
"...It doesn't mean you have to settle.
He's not an insurance claim."

859
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,996
So I caught the first
plane off the island.

860
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,787
Cleveland's not an island.
Oh, baby, it is.

861
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,744
Anyway, here I am.
It's so good to see you.

862
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,250
You never told me you
had a hot boyfriend.

863
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,207
He's not my boyfriend, Mom.

864
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,167
That's right, we're just friends.
I love it.

865
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,670
It's like the '70s in here.

866
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,635
That was a better
time. Just sex.

867
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,805
A little grass, a little glue...
Not during pregnancy.

868
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,599
(WHISPERING) Well, not
during the final trimester.

869
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,180
But no complications.
It's great!

870
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,854
Okay, well, that's technically,
I guess, what this is.

871
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,314
That's exactly what this is.

872
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,278
So my daughter is
just your slampiece?

873
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,322
No, no. "Slampiece"?

874
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,658
I'm just kidding. Slam away.

875
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,113
Have fun. I think this is great.

876
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,820
The only thing is, it
takes you off the market.

877
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,954
But what the hell.
The whole reason you go to the market

878
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,783
is to buy the produce,
which you already got.

879
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,997
It's so good to see you, baby.
I'm only gonna be here a few weeks.

880
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,998
I'm starving. You got any gin?

881
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,959
It's in the kitchen.

882
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,507
You gotta go.

883
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,306
Is she wearing Axe body spray?
I don't know. Come on.

884
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,679
LORNA: Bananas in the refrigerator?
What are you, Puerto Rican?

885
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,558
That is terrible, Mother. Just joking.
Your dad was Puerto Rican.

886
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,181
What? You said
that he was Greek.

887
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,815
Potato, potato...
Get your shoes.

888
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,439
Okay. All right. Well, not...
Just go, just go.

889
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,065
I'll just put these
on on the bike?

890
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,233
Yeah. Okay.

891
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,901
It was nice to have met you...

892
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,615
LORNA: Hey.
And your pants are coming off.

893
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,739
Oh, my... Mom! Mom, please!

894
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,029
Back, back!

895
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,919
That's what I'm talking about!

896
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:39,206
We're kicking every
gay ass out here!

897
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,758
I don't say that pejoratively,
I say it hopefully.

898
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,376
Hold it. Any of you gay?

899
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,045
Not even you? Come on, man.

900
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,263
Come talk to me after.
Give me five minutes of your time.

901
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,098
I might be able to let
you see some reason.

902
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,638
(LETA WOMAN BE A WOMAN

905
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,015
Look at you in the house!

906
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,224
Come on, baby!

907
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:00,852
I'm supposed to
meet up with Jamie.

908
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,609
Who's that, that headhunter?
Uh-huh.

909
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,198
What, you guys going out now?

910
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,901
No, no, no, We're just friends.
We're messing around a little bit.

911
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,994
What do you mean?
Sleeping together.

912
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,366
But it's just sex.

913
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,073
That never works, bro.

914
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,918
She's a girl. Sex always means more
to them even if they don't admit it.

915
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,168
Jamie's different.

916
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,838
Does she have a penis where
most girls have a vagina?

917
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,586
No penis.
Then she's no different.

918
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,292
What do you know
about women, anyway?

919
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,091
Dude, I've turned down more
tail than you'll ever have.

920
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,303
Yeah, bro. You're gay.

921
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,259
But the offers still keep rolling
in, naturally. Look at me.

922
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,557
And, hey, I love women.
They're beautiful, majestic,

923
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,435
mysterious, mesmerizing
creatures.

924
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,736
Smart, empathetic.
Far superior to men in every way.

925
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,572
And if I had a choice, I would
be with women to my dying day.

926
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,821
But me likes cock so I'm
strict-aly dick-aly.

927
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,246
So it's always just
about sex, then?

928
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,666
No. I've been in love.
I went down that rabbit hole.

929
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,288
You know what I discovered?

930
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,045
It's not who you want to
spend Friday night with,

931
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,589
it's who you want to spend
all day Saturday with.

932
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,756
Feel me, Felix?

933
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,177
Yeah, but then it's every Saturday
for the rest of your life.

934
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,096
It's okay, you don't get it.

935
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,841
It's no big deal. But you will.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

936
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:17,099
One day, you'll meet someone and it'll
literally take your breath away.

937
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:21,357
Like you can't breathe.
Like no oxygen to the lungs.

938
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,860
Like a fish...
Yeah, I get it, Tommy.

939
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,444
Yeah, you don't.

940
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,356
Nice work on that new
online site, by the way.

941
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,317
What was the font
on that headline?

942
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,700
It was Times Roman.

943
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,116
Times Roman. Inspired. I'm out.

944
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,707
You have a boat?

945
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,169
I live in Jersey.
And I ain't taking no ferry.

946
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,460
Unless it's out to
dinner and a show. Bam!

947
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,017
Hey. Yeah.

948
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:10,445
You and that Dylan? Way to go.
I mean the whole friendship-sex thing.

949
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,196
Kudos, baby, kudos.

950
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,363
(LAUGHS)

951
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,036
It's not that big of a deal.

952
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,658
It's just surprising.

953
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,365
I always thought you were
a true-love kind of girl.

954
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,539
Whatever, Mom. It's not like
it's stopping me from anything.

955
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,545
That's what I thought
back in '78,

956
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,672
And every year since.

957
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,258
I'm just...
I'm flattered, actually.

958
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,878
The apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

959
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,009
It's just surprising.

960
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,225
There, done. It's...
There we go. Okay.

961
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,848
You look great! You look great.
You look like a princess.

962
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,728
Yeah! Really?

963
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,234
Yeah. Okay.

964
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,196
Hey, my friend gave me his
house in Montauk for July 4th.

965
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,150
Let's you and me go away together.
No men, no bullshit.

966
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,744
Just mother-daughter.
Like a Nora Ephron movie. (SCOFFS)

967
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,410
When was the last time we spent
a full weekend together?

968
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,576
When I was eight, that time in Vermont.
We got snowed in with the ski instructor.

969
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,792
Demitri. Bill.

970
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,253
He reminded me a lot
of your father.

971
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,923
Dark curls, olive skin,
Cold War accent.

972
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,883
My father was Russian?
I don't remember.

973
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,091
But what I do remember is we drank a
lot of vodka and shot a lot of guns.

974
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,757
Mom, this "who's your daddy"
game is getting really old.

975
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,601
I know I haven't been the
best mother in the world...

976
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,064
I'm sorry, were you waiting
for me to jump in?

977
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,393
Come on! Go away with me.
Come on!

978
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,070
Come on. Come on. (LAUGHING)

979
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,323
Okay, we'll do it.
It'll be fun, yeah?

00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,949
Mom... I was trying to bond!

983
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,452
It was either this or sniff glue.
(LAUGHS)

984
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,251
Sorry about my mom.
I thought she was funny.

985
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,133
Yeah, she's really funny
when she's asking for money,

986
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,803
and she's hilarious when
she needs a place to stay.

987
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,265
Dylan, I think I wanna
start dating again.

988
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,144
Listen, I think
we should stop this.

989
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,444
Hmm. Yeah?

990
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,195
I kind of think you're right.

991
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,317
Right?

992

♪ Every new beginning comes from
some other beginning's end ♪

993
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,916
That actually makes sense
right here.

994
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,960
Who would've thought Third Eye
Blind could be so prophetic?

995
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,161
Not Third Eye Blind.

996
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,005
I'm pretty sure
that's Third Eye Blind.

997
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,289
Do you wanna go
grab some lunch?

998
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,499
Yes. Okay.

999
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,301
You're buying. What?

00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,637
Okay.

00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:40,639
Oh.

00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,008
Pants. Shirt.

1003
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,847
So this is the end of this?

1004
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,887
I guess so. But it's good. Yeah.

1005
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,389
And We did it.
With no bullshit.

1006
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,560
Shirt. Sweater.

1007
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,316
We managed to actually
stay friends.

1008
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:52,810
Yup. Yeah.

1009
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,029
Okay. So, what is
your type, anyway?

1010
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,193
No, I don't have a type.

1011
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,579
It's more about what's inside.
Oh, please!

1012
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,414
Okay, what about her?

1013
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,038
DYLAN: Yeah. I could get
to know her inside.

1014
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,206
And she's reading a book.

1015
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:11,333
It's probably Nicholas Sparks.

1016
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,669
I'm gonna go talk to her. What?

1017
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,917
What do you mean, "What?
" We said we wanted to date again.

1018
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,715
I'm gonna go talk to her. Now?

all of these people?

Especially when you move
eight times.

likes to break up with guys,

1087

and she was really good at it.

1088

No, no, he was long before that.

Please don't tell me
you're a dude.

third time since I moved here,

I can handle that.

How's your boy Parker?
Still staring at trees?

1192
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,888
Two coffees.
Yeah, he's still looking up at trees,

1193
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,231
but this time it's actually
in my apartment.

1194
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,726
It's the fifth date already?
Maybe. Thank you.

1195
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,569
Did you guys "fifth-data?"

1196
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,030
How dare you!
A lady never tells.

1197
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,364
I know.
That's why I'm asking you.

1198
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:19,529
(LAUGHS)

1199
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:24,746
Hey. I gotta go. You have a great
trip in LA and call me when you land.

1200
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,198
Okay.

1201
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,745
JAMIE: Parker.

1202
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,705
Hey.

1203
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:30,874
Um...

1204
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,838
I got us coffees.
Nonfat, one sugar, one Splenda.

1205
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,041
I gotta get going. Oh, what?

1206
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,418
I thought you weren't
on call today.

1207
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,843
I'm not, but I got that thing...
I got stuff.

1208
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,548
This... They just called me.

1209
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,518
Really? Yeah.

1210
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,897
The sneak-out.
How incredibly cliché of you.

1211
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,390
I just...

1212
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,268
I don't think I can be
your Prince Charming.

1213
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,237
God, you totally didn't get anything
that I was saying, did you?

1214
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,699
No, no, no. I think you're great.
Yeah, you, too.

1215
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,697
Hey, you know what?
You and I should stay friends.

1216
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,778
Really? No, go fuck yourself.

1217
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,913
(NICE TRY PLAYING)

1218
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,090
DYLAN: Who sleeps standing up?

1219
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:18,755
You know,
you'd be really proud of me.

1220
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,799
I didn't even blink when I
told him to go fuck himself.

1221
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:24,594
You did just then, though.
This does not count. I'm not in the moment.

1222
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,888
I don't know,
maybe I suck in bed.

1223
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,310
Trust me,
you don't suck in bed.

1224
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,937
Thank you. So needy.

1225
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,681
Hey, maybe the guy's
married or something.

1226
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,607
No, did a background check
at work.

1227
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:37,820
Single, no criminal history,
credit report 720.

1228
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,529
Background check.
Did you do one on me?

1229
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,824
How could you possibly
max out an Old Navy card?

1230
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,113
After college I was
really into cargo pants.

1231
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,662
Dylan, I gotta stop thinking
it's not me.

1232
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:50,032
I mean, it's gotta be me.
It's not you.

1233
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,367
Nothing is wrong with you.

1234
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,452
He's a guy.
You gave him a five-date challenge,

1235
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,955
he got you and cutout.
Forget the douche.

1236
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,502
He's a dick.
He's a dick-douche.

1237
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,168
Go have fun with your mom.

1238
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,842
Okay. Oh. Almost forgot.
I got you something.

1239
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,145
It's Lieutenant Kali, the
street artist we talked about.

1240
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,810
I got him to do something
for you. "F-tale." Fairytale.

1241
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:21,651
I know you're into that girly shit, so...
This is so cool.

1242
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,741
Dylan,
that's actually really sweet.

1243
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,818
It's cool, right?
Yeah. Thank you.

1244
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,327
Hey, I'm gonna need
to borrow cab fare.

1245
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,663
I'm not taking that thing on the subway.
I don't wanna get rolled.

1246
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:34,876
No problem.

1247
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,995
As long as you get your feet off my bed.
They're disgusting.

1248
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,381
What are you doing?

1249
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,796
Why are you doing that?
Why are you doing that?

1250
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,211
You're an animal. Stop doing that.
An animal. Stop.

1251
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,808
Hey, Ma.

1252
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,557
Ma. Come on,
we gotta get on the road.

1253
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,355
Come on.

1254
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,894
Ma?

1255
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,832
Ouch.

1256
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,411
Why did I think that this
time would be any different?

1257
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:19,163
Come with me to LA. What?

1258
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,965
What else are you gonna do?
It's 4th of July, everybody's left the city.

1259
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,792
You're very sweet for asking,
but it's fine.

1260
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,548
You know what, I'll just stay here.
I'll be fine alone.

1261
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,888
I know you'll be fine alone.
You're not a baby in a hot car.

1262
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,723
I'm actually asking you to
come because it would help me.

1263
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,767
You'd be a great distraction
for my family.

1264
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:35,057
They'd forget all about
drilling me for being single.

1265
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,392
Won't they think
that we're together?

1266
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,561
Not if I tell them we're not.
And they'll believe you?

1267
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:41,060
Yeah, we're one of these crazy families
that doesn't lie to each other.

1268
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,527
PBS is doing
a documentary on us.

1269
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:43,775
Come on, they'll love you.

1270
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:46,364
All fast-talking and brusque,
like I'm bringing home a carny.

1271
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,535
You're really nice to ask,
but I'm just gonna stay here.

1272
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,861
Go to the gym.

1273
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:54,035
I just got you a ticket with my
miles, it's done. Meet me at JFK.

1274
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,536
But... No buts.

1275
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,459
Like you were gonna go to the gym.
I wasn't.

(SUCH A COLORFUL WORLD PLAYING)

1277
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,516

1278
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,970
Hmm. And everyone's so
genuine and level-headed.

Thanks for this.
You're good peeps.

You're the good peeps, dude.

1282
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:25,104
You haven't met my family.
You don't know what you're in for.

1283
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,069
Okay.

1284
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,158
(SIGHING) You know these planes
pretty much land themselves?

1285
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,154
Nobody cares.
You sound like an asshole.

1286
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:35,990
She's from New York.

1287
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,457
I'm sorry.

1288
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,424
Wow. This looks normal.

1289
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:51,756
It is.

Wow, you grew up here?

1292
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,474
It was my grandfather's.

1293
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:04,268
He bought it when there
was nothing else here.

1294
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,653
My dad and my sister
and her son live here now.

Why would you move to New York?

Hi. Thank you for having me.

Oh, please. It's nice to have
Dylan bring a girl home.

We're just friends.
Oh, no, I know.

If you were his girlfriend, he
never would've brought you here.

1322

This one has intimacy issues.
I know.

How you doing, buddy? I'm good.

I'm sorry. I... That's okay.

No, for a minute you reminded
me of a girl I used to know.

No, that's okay. It happens.
Nice to meet you.

Pleasure meeting you.
You have a beautiful house.

Thank you.

Pool's a little cold, but it's
very expensive to heat, so...

and check the tide tables

out early in the morning.

driving the boat any more.

It was nice meeting you, too.

What's with the pants?
He doesn't like them any more.

Go show her the beach.

me about your dad.

Yeah, it's been tough on him.
They were real close.

to deal with the Alzheimer's.

01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:26,763
Okay.

1520
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:28,852
Oh, no, not that one.
The one on top.

1521
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:31,101
This is a good one. So...

1522
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:32,394
Yeah? Shuffle.

1523
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:34,480
Did you get her
an engagement gift?

1524
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:37,486
We're not engaged, Dad.
We're not together. We're just friends.

1525
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:41,738
All right, you don't wanna label it.
I understand. But get her some jewelry.

1526
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,110
The only thing your mom
loves is jewelry.

1527
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:47,739
I don't care how upset she is, I get
her jewelry, she lights right up.

1528
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,286
Where is she, anyway?

1529
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,790
She's not here, Dad.
I know, that's why I asked. Where is she?

1530
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,295
She's not coming. Why not?

1531
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:01,586
She doesn't live with you any more, Pop.
You're not married.

1532
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,964
MR. HARPER: What?
She left about 10 years ago.

1533
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:06,181
I don't understand.

1534
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,468
She divorced you, Dad.

1535
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:12,939
I have to call her.
Dad, you can't.

1536
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,436
Stop telling me what to do.

1537
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,981

DYLAN: You okay, Dad?
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1541
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:27,699
Here, let me help you up.
No, don't. Don't!

Here we are.

1545
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,861
This is beautiful.

1546
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,735
Yeah, this is where I used
to come to think. My rooftop.

1547
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,320
Okay, how high do you
think that fence is?

1548
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:10,989
I'm a little over 6 foot.

1549
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:14,409
Looks like it's about three of me.
So six times three...

1550
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:17,166
Ninety-two feet.

1551
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:21,041
Ninety-two feet.
That's really tall, right? Yeah.

1552
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,503
But they don't want you to get up
there, so I guess that makes sense.

1553
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:29,341
Wait. Six times three...
Oh, God, you poor kid.

1554
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,059
What's up? Come on.

1555
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,057
What? What?
Where are you going?

1556
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:37,398
Jamie, no, no, no, no, no, wait.
They take this shit seriously, okay?

1557
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,516
Look at all the cameras.

1558
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:41,978
This is the only landmark this city has
other than the Scientology Center.

1559
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,156
And if any of these cameras are hooked
up to the actual Scientology Center,

1560
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,108
that was an inappropriate joke
and I apologize.

1561
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,785
I believe in the freedom
of science fiction.

Come on!

1565

JAMIE: You really never been
up here before? DYLAN: No.

1566
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,219
I've also never transferred
heroin in my rectum,

1567
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:09,092
'cause it's against the law.

1568
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:13,222
You know, sometimes a simple
yes or no answer is adequate.

1569
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:15,057
Hey, why didn't you tell me
about your mom?

1570
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:17,555
She's not worth talking about.

1571
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:19,223
That's rough.

1572
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:20,934
So is leaving
your husband and kids.

1573
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:24,107
Yeah, you never told me
about him either.

1574
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:26,151
You know, there's a lot of
stuff you didn't tell me.

1575
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,819
I don't want your pity.

1576
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:33,071
I can handle anything except
that look in people's eyes.

1577
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:38,413
That one.
Who cares what anybody thinks?

1578
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,248
He's the smartest man
I've ever known.

1579
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:42,295
He's the only person
I'd ever go to for advice.

1580
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:43,665
He's my dad.

1581
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,211
Dylan, he's still the same man.

1582
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,634
When I see the way
people look at him now...

1583
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:49,925
It doesn't matter
how people look at him.

1584
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:51,256
All that matters
is how you look at him.

1585
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:54,182
Yeah, but he's walking around without his pants.
Everyone's staring.

1586
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,893
So what? It's embarrassing.

1587
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,641
He needs to know
that nothing has changed.

1588
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:59,639
That he's still that
same man to you.

1589
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:01,766
Can we stop talking about this?

1590
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:06,563
Yeah, that's really smart.
Let's just not talk about our feelings.

1591
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:07,771
I'm trying not to.

1592
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:12,869
Come on. Is something going on here?
You've been acting really weird.

1593
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,946
No, I haven't. Yeah, you have.

1594
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:16,826
Is this about what happened
the other night?

1595
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:19,041
What, sex? That doesn't mean anything.
You know that.

1596
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:23,333
Right.

1597
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:25,627

you have a fear of heights?

to have sex with her.

It's just physical.

01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:26,510
Too gay? A little bit.

1852
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,603
Throw some girls in there.

1853
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:31,356
Come on, ladies. Hop to.

1854
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:36,233
Girls, girls. Okay, look.
Just blend in.

01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,534
What are you doing here?
You met for another job!

1858
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:44,862
What, are you gonna leave now?

1859
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:46,242
I don't know. Yeah,
I took one meeting.

1860
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:47,572
I can't believe you.

1861
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:49,286
Come here. (SIGHS)

1862
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,918
Is this your way of
getting back at me? What?

1863
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:54,037
You know that if you leave before
a year is up, I get screwed.

1864
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:55,922
Oh, right.

1865
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:57,256
If I did leave,

1866
01:28:57,374 --> 01:29:00,173
which I don't know yet because
all I did was take one meeting,

1867
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,095
I'd write you a check
for your bonus.

1868
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,883
Whatever it is, I'll pay for it.
Happy now? We good?

1869
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:07,096
Why didn't you tell
me you were looking?

1870
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:08,218
That's personal.

1871
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,723
And we're not friends any more.

1872
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:10,975
You made that pretty clear.

1873
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:15,813
See, all I wanted to do was
have sex with you. Remember?

1874
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,153
Pretend you were the best
friend I'd ever had.

1875
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:20,071
Open up to you like I've
never done with anyone ever.

1876
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:21,649
And then when the sex stopped,

1877
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:23,904
invite you to LA
for the weekend to,

1878
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:25,068
(SCATTING DRAMATICALLY)

1879
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:26,786
introduce you to my family.

1880
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:29,447
I'll send you a check
if I take the job.

1881
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:30,740
Don't bother.

1882
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,835
TOMMY: Why don't you
pick him up?

1883
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:40,842
Yeah. Just pick him on up.

1884
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:43,254
Oh, you little
Christ figure, you!

1887
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:08,445
Hey, Dyl.

1888
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:09,779
Dad's coming into
Newark Airport, right?

1889
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:11,615
Yeah, he leaves
at 9:00 our time.

1890
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:14,625
9:00. So it's a five-hour flight,
three-hour time difference,

1891
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,169
so he gets in at

1893
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:20,632
5:00. Be there at 5:00, Dylan.

1894
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:22,675
Right. How is Dad?

1895
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,006
Ah.

1896
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,839
He's lost more
often than not now.

1897
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:29,967
But then he has these moments of real clarity.
It's hit or miss.

1898
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,222
Okay. How's Jamie?

1899
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,313
That's over. Oh, Dylan!

01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:36,519
Okay, we're done.

1901
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,233
Don't be an idiot, please.

1902
01:30:38,308 --> 01:30:40,652
Thank you, Annie.
I'll pick up Dad tomorrow at the airport.

1903
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:42,813
32:00 sharp. I love you.

looking for a replacement for him,

1906
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:51,662
assuming that he leaves.

1907
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:53,581
Do you want some
motherly love advice?

1908
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:55,037
Not really.

01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:56,785
Oh, good, 'cause
I don't know how to do that.

1910

it's no great goddamn secret

Eighty. One.

Eighty-one? One.

1916
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:14,394
Oh. It was your dad.
Greatest man I ever met.

1917
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:16,267
Obviously. Look at you.

1918
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:19,566
How smart you are, how great,
how funny, how driven.

1919
01:31:19,683 --> 01:31:21,026
Your vaguely
Middle Eastern beauty.

didn't all come from me.

01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:28,700
do you really not remember
where my dad's from?

1923
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,447
Or is it like
a coping mechanism?

1924
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:31,574
A little of both.

1925
01:31:31,695 --> 01:31:32,696
(LAUGHING) Okay.

1926
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:34,656

him when you see him.

Mom, it's Prince Charming.
You should just know.

1931

Well, your Prince
Charming isn't coming

a horse and carriage.

That's not who you want.

I mean, you're looking
for a man to be your partner.

How was the flight? I'm hungry.

1943
01:32:30,587 --> 01:32:32,305
You know they don't serve
food in coach any more?

1944
01:32:32,422 --> 01:32:33,514
You'd think with
these new planes,

1945
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:34,682
they practically
fly themselves,

1946
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:37,307
they could get rid of a pilot and
use his salary for a hot lunch.

these planes is so advanced.

Completely computerized.

Exactly.

It's ridiculous.

I'll be right back, okay?

1954

I got you.

I have to seat people
in the order they came.

01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:01,493
I totally understand that,
but I'm with my dad

1958
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:03,495
and he's not in the best shape.
Oh, I'm sorry.

like, squeeze a table?

by the list. Sorry.

that I met in the Navy.

Okay?

1979
01:34:43,553 --> 01:34:44,896
Why didn't you tell
me about her before?

This is not something you
discuss with your children.

1981
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:50,853
And besides, I have you and Annie.
I have no regrets.

1982
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:51,982
So tell me now.

1983
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:55,607
She was the love of my life.

1984
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:56,984
And I was too
stupid to realize it,

1985
01:34:57,066 --> 01:35:00,161
and I lost her because of something
so dumb I don't even remember.

1986
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:02,326
And I never
really got over her.

1987
01:35:02,906 --> 01:35:06,581
And I think that may be one
of the reasons your mom left.

1988
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:09,413
You know, my friends
used to say

1989
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,414
that when Dede and I
looked at each other,

1990
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:12,753
it was electric.

1991
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:14,084
And I let her go.

1992
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,843
I just let her go.

1993
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:19,469
Because I was too damn proud to tell
her how I really felt about her.

1994
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:22,767
I'll tell you something that I
wish I Knew when I was your age.

And I know you've heard a
million times, "life is short."

1996
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:28,439
But let me tell you something,
what this is teaching me

1997
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:31,643
is that life is goddamn short and
you can't waste a minute of it.

home to LA, Jamie?

01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:47,451

2002
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,293
Fix it. She won't talk to me.

2003
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:51,747
Maybe she'll listen.
There's always a way.

there's even a chance

2005

that she could
be it, you fix it.

01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:25,412
Oh. I am so sorry, sir.

2021
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:26,614
It's my fault.

2022
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,364
You just scared me. No, no.
My fault. You all right?

2023
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:29,868
Yeah, I'm good.
Here, let me help you with that.

2024
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:31,165
Thanks, man.
You're really nice.

2025
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:32,579
All right. Hey, safe travels.

2026
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:33,914
All right, thanks, man.
Okay, thank you.

2027
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:35,044
Oh.

2028
01:36:35,164 --> 01:36:36,837
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

2029
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,759
All right, let's
dance, Clowny Brown.

2030
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:40,135
What's your problem with me?

2031
01:36:40,211 --> 01:36:41,758
I saw you at
that bar with Jamie.

2032
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:44,341
How could such an awesome
girl be with this

2033
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:45,850
over this?

2034
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:49,019
I've been trying to take that little
monkey to pound-town for years.

2035
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:51,355
I'll tell her you say hello.
What?

2036
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,604
You missed a little.
There you go.

2037
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:55,356
Dylan! I got a cab. Come on.

2038
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:56,857
I ever run into you again,

2039
01:36:56,936 --> 01:36:59,359
I'll crush your earlobes and
make soup stock out of them.

2040
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:01,524
You have a vivid imagination.
I do!

2041
01:37:01,607 --> 01:37:02,699
I'm gonna get in the cab now.

2042
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:03,951
I'm gonna go make soup!

2043
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:05,904
What's the matter with her?
I don't know.

2044
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:13,378
God! I thought LA was bad.
This traffic is terrible.

2045
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:14,788
Is there another
way into the city?

2046
01:37:25,214 --> 01:37:27,308
DYLAN: I owe you
big time, Tommy.

2047
01:37:27,383 --> 01:37:31,763
You'll make it up to me.
Actually, I was heading into town anyway.

2048
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:36,564
Tonight's the Butterfly Ball.
Great place to pick up dudes.

2049
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:37,773
You okay, Dad?

2050
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:38,986
Are you kidding?

2051
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:42,362
1937 Chris-Craft?
Couldn't get any better, buddy.

2052
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,566
Nice.

2053
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,991
Yeah. Hi, this is Dylan.
We met at...

2054
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:51,166
Right.
Can I ask you a huge favor?

2055
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:58,005
My number. Here's the remote.

2056
01:37:58,247 --> 01:37:59,749
My friend Dave
from across the hall,

2057
01:37:59,916 --> 01:38:01,418
his oven broke, so
he'll be using the kitchen.

2058
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:04,505
Your friend Dave is here using
the Kitchen or watching me?

2059
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:06,426
Go.

2060
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:08,303
Holy... What?

2061
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:10,267
"How to wear white
pants to a cookout."

2062
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:13,521
Did you scoop the Times on this?
I smell Pulitzer.

2063
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:15,314
All right, all right.

2064
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:16,853
Just say hello to
her for me, will you?

2065
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,272
See you, Dad.

2066
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:21,191
Thanks, man.

2067
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:23,693
Hi, Dave from across the hall.

2068
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:27,494
(SLOWLY AND LOUDLY) Hi, Mr.
Harper. How are you?

2069
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:29,954
And now we know
why you're here.

2070
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:34,542
Mom, I'm over by the Lexington exit.
Where are you?

2071
01:38:34,617 --> 01:38:36,745
LORNA: I'm standing right
by the guy in the tie.

2072
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:38,626
There are a million
guys in ties.

2073
01:38:38,788 --> 01:38:40,506
So look for the guy
I'm standing next to.

2074
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:43,467
You never do what you say you're gonna do.
When am I gonna learn?

2075
01:38:43,668 --> 01:38:45,170
Just hang on, baby.

2076
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:47,464
(JUMP BEGINS PLAYING
OVER THE PA)

2077
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:50,891
What?

2078
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:55,142
I don? Think I'm gonna be
able to make it after all.

2079
01:38:55,221 --> 01:38:57,349
Something came up.
Let's meet tomorrow.

2080
01:38:57,473 --> 01:39:00,568
I'll be on the stairs.
Right across from you.

2081
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:06,490
Oh, my God.

2082
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:08,326
Have a great night, baby.

2083
01:39:10,486 --> 01:39:12,580
(CLOSING TIME BEGINS TO PLAY)

2084
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:20,998
(MOUTHING THE WORDS)

2085
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:29,259
What is this?

2086
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:32,054
It's Closing Time,
by the band Semisonic!

2087
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:34,639
It's not Third Eye Blind.
Can you believe that?

2088
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,518
No, no, no. Not the song. This.

2089
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:39,724
You said you wanted your life
to be like a movie.

2090
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:44,278
Sorry I had to use the real Grand
Central instead of the fake one.

2091
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:52,119
Listen, Jamie, I'm...

2092
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:54,368
I'm having trouble hearing you!

2093
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:56,324
Yeah, I didn't
really think this through.

2094
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,751
I guess in the movies
the guy pours his heart out

2095
01:39:58,868 --> 01:40:00,245
and they put
the music in later.

2096
01:40:00,411 --> 01:40:01,583
What?

2097
01:40:04,874 --> 01:40:06,046
I messed up.

2098
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:08,545
I was scared.

2099
01:40:09,378 --> 01:40:11,096
Look at what happened
with my mom and my dad.

2100
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:12,306
Of course I was scared.

2101
01:40:13,466 --> 01:40:14,763
So I ruined it.

2102
01:40:15,718 --> 01:40:17,516
Everything that
happens in the day,

2103
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:20,769
all I can think to myself is, "I can't
wait to tell Jamie about this."

2104
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:24,895
When I see someone cursing, all
I picture is you blinking.

2105
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,947
And when I hear a kid's
been cured of cancer,

2106
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:30,324
I pray it's not
by that douchebag,

2107
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:33,323
tree-hugging fucking doctor
who ran out on you.

2108
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:35,663
I mean, cancer
being cured is awesome,

2109
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:37,949
but, you know,
I wish someone else did it.

2110
01:40:38,824 --> 01:40:40,121
Come on.

2111
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:47,425
Hey, I miss you.

2112
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:49,176
Yeah, I miss you, too.

2113
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:51,595
But you're not wrong,
I am damaged.

2114
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:53,973
So am I. Who isn't?

2115
01:40:54,257 --> 01:40:55,975
That's what
makes us so awesome.

2116
01:40:56,259 --> 01:40:57,932
And our tattoos. Yeah.

2117
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:01,268
No, no, no.

2118
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:02,602
Oh, shut up.
It's not what you think.

2119
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:05,609
Jamie, will you be
my best friend again?

2120
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:07,691
That is so lame.

2121
01:41:07,853 --> 01:41:08,945
I know.

2122
01:41:10,106 --> 01:41:11,733
That's some Prince Charming
shit, though, right?

2123
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:13,033
Get up. Okay.

2124
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,705
Look, I can live without ever
having sex with you again.

2125
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:19,289
It'd be really hard.

2126
01:41:19,365 --> 01:41:20,412
(LAUGHS)

2127
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:23,370
Hey, I want my
best friend back,

2128
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:25,462
because I'm in love with her.

2129
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:27,456
Under one condition.

2130
01:41:27,623 --> 01:41:28,795
Anything.

2131
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:31,969
Kiss me.

2132
01:41:33,546 --> 01:41:34,798
In public?
In front of all these people?

2133
01:41:34,964 --> 01:41:36,181
I did not ask you to...

2134
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:57,536
You can all go home now.

2135
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:06,044
Okay. So...

2136
01:42:08,998 --> 01:42:10,045
What do we do now?

2137
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:11,167
Have our first date.

2138
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:12,668
Okay.

2139
01:42:12,835 --> 01:42:14,382
(HEY, SOUL SISTER PLAYING)

2140
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:18,933
Oh, my God!
Did you get a horse and carriage?

2141
01:42:20,009 --> 01:42:21,852
Yeah, that's not for you.

2142
01:42:22,053 --> 01:42:25,102
Oh, thank God. Horses actually
scare the shit out of me.

2143
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:26,516
Really? Yeah.

2144
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:27,934
DYLAN: So, where are you from?

2145
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:29,189
Outside of Philly, actually.

2146
01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:30,569
Interesting.

2147
01:42:30,770 --> 01:42:32,522
I'm from LA,
just moved to New York.

2148
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:34,361
Interesting.
Didn't really ask, but go on.

2149
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:37,740
What? I'm excited,
I'm on a first date. So...

2150
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:40,242
This isn't weird at all.

2151
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:41,410
We're okay.

2152
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:42,622
Yeah. Thank you.

2153
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:46,536

2154
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:50,714
Yeah, fuck it.
