00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,063
Christ.

2
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,650
Hey.

3
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:21,247
Yeah?

4
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,127
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

5
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,254
Wait a minute, slow down.

6
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,464
Slow down.

7
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,676
Hold on.

8
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,768
Yeah.

9
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,689
No, l've been up
since the crack of dawn.

10
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,028
What tuition?

11
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,865
How much does it cost?

12
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,035
No.

13
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,537
No. No, no, no.

14
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,705
That's not true. That's not true.

15
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,666
You're the one that wanted him to go
to private school, not me.

16
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,710
Well, put Knuckles on the phone.

17
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,798
Then tell him it's a two-way street.

18
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,091
l call him, he's gotta call me.

19
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,553
Oh, he's my son now?

20
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,806
Because you want him to go to...

21
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,724
You want a fucking tuition check.

22
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,231
That's great, Deana. That's great.

23
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,608
You call me, 7:00
in the morning in Orlando

24
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,443
to shake me down for fucking money.
That's great.

25
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:34,737
Does he even
want to go to the fucking school?

26
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,744
All right, look, just... l got a 9:00 flight.

27
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,121
Sit tight. l'll be in Atlanta in a minute.

28
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,583
And how am l a liar?

29
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,753
Yeah, but how does that
make me a liar?

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,549
How...

31
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,427
All right.

32
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,598
All right, bye.

33
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,936
Was that your wife?

34
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,771
My ex-wife.

35
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,777
But you, Trina, you could
be my second wife.

36
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,865
Don't joke about that, papi.

37
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,118
-Our flight's at 9:00.
-Flight's at 9:00.

41
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,004
l should have ate something.

42
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,610

43
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,737
after all the passengers get on board.

44
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,322
-Okay.

That sky gonna hold?

50
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,626
You're not gonna make me spend
another night in Orlando.

51
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,712
Don't worry, l will get you to
your prayer meeting on time.

52
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,589
What is it, Jesus Christ Superstar,

53
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,174
First 27th Baptists?

54
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,301
That's right.
Christ the King First Baptist Church

55
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,552

56
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,680
And l'm still saving
a seat for you, right next to me.

57
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,556
-Save two.
-l will.

58
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,225
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Captain.

59
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,394
Walk around is complete.

60
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,020
Margaret!

61
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,067
Yeah, could you get me
a cup of coffee, black,

62
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,153

okay, sweetie?

63
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,572
-Okay, you want something?
-No, ma'am, thank you.

64
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,325
Have we flown together before?

65
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,412
-l don't think so, sir.
-You sure?

66
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,080
Yeah. Ken Evans.

67
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,748
Whip Whitaker.

68
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,376
-Nice to meet you.
-My pleasure.

69
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,754
Oxygen check.

70
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,260
That checks. You want a hit?

71
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,596
-No, thank you, sir.
-You sure?

72
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,432

How are you feeling today, sir?

78
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,916
A little tired. A quick turnaround for me,

79
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,294
1 0 turns in three days. Off tomorrow.

80
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,297
-Here's your coffee.
-Oh, thank you.

81
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,799
-And your aspirin.
-Thank you.

82
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,469
And the manifest

00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,137
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

84
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,639
Let's get them tucked in.
We're ready to push.

85
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,516
You got it.

86
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,170
Oh, please don't pick up.

87
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,965
Don't pick up.

88
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,514
Yo.

89
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,809
Hi, it's Nic. Do you have any?

90
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,437
Kip.

91
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:19,688
Hey, baby, come here. How are you?

92
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,026
lt's good to see you.
Nicole, this is Tiki Pot.

93
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,861
Tiki is my partner in this new series.

94
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:26,987
He knows a lot about porn.

95
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,197
l need two grams.

96
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,158
We are putting the narrative
back into porn, baby.

97
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,369
Desdemona.

98
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,287
You could totally play Desdemona.

99
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,914
-Look at you. You're perfect.
-Desdemona? What the fuck?

100
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,624
Fuck, yeah! You're perfect.
Look at this. Beautiful.

101
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,709
She do anal, $2,000, one hour.

102
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,003
All right. l don't do porn, Kip.

103
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,089
-Okay. Listen, listen...
-Just let me see the H.

104
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,465
lt's an Othello theme, okay?

105
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,884
The Moor comes in,
finds you in bed with one of his nurses.

106
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,011
And he fucks me in the ass, huh?

107
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,763
College student. Very clean. Brett!

108
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,932
We're putting a whole new spin
on the beast with two backs, baby.

109
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,101
ln fact, that's what it's called,
The Beast With Two Backs.

110
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,270
l don't understand why you told me
you had some but you haven't.

111
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,479
Or "Holethello" or "Butt Holethello."

112
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,022
Show her the pipe.

113
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,610
Tiki, that's your name?

114
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,906
Why don't you shove that in your ass
and you call me in the morning?

115
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,993
Hey, Nicole! Nicole! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

116
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,744
Slow down, slow down.
Hey, l'm sorry, all right?

117
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,580
We're tweaked. Okay? l'm sorry.

118
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,248
Hey, stick around. lt's not a big deal.

119
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,750
Sit down and take
some stills for me or something.

120
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,296
What's going on with you?
l thought you were clean.

121
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,549
Now you're, like,
freaking out on me and...

122
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,384
Oh, come on.

123
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,428
Don't cry.

124
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,599
l... l just want to get faded, Kip.

125
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,477
-l have $1 00. Please.
-l don't want it. No, keep it.

126
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,605
Keep it. l don't want it. Okay?

127
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:44,607
Listen.

128
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,819
This is the Taliban, okay?
Very heavy. Okay?

129
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,279
l can handle it.

130
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,199
l don't want you shooting this shit.
lt's too heavy, all right?

131
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,618
l won't. l promise.

132
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,787
l'm just going to smoke it.

133
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,748
l haven't used needles in weeks.

134
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,458
Okay. No needles.

135
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,627
And if you get a little too low,

136
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,879
you just do a little coke, okay?

137
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,505
Get yourself back up, all right?

138
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,049
-Right where you need to be.
-Okay.

139
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,800
-All right?
-Yeah.

140
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,053
-Okay, baby.
-Thanks.

141
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,096
All carry-on items are safely stored

142
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,307
in the overhead bin
or under the seat in front of you.

143
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,061
AIso, aII eIectronic devices
must be turned off at this time.

144
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,314
Our flight time to Atlanta
is approximately 52 minutes.

145
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,149
Flight attendants, take your seats.

146
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,819
So what did you do last night?

147
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,404
l crashed, went straight to bed.

148
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,615
All right, here we go.

149
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,328
Engine instruments are in the green.

150
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,956
Airspeeds alive, both sides.

151
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,791
Eighty knots, crosscheck.

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,793
lt's like a video game, right?

153
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:52,132
Oh! Nothing like
a little 30-knot crosswind

154
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,593
to exercise the old sphincter muscle.

155
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,011
V1 ,

156
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,347
and rotate.

157
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,185
We're at a positive rate.

158
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,020
Gear up.

159
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,857
Yee-hah, ride 'em, cowboy.

00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,453
Don't want autopilot. l'm flying today.

164
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,789
SouthJet 227, Orlando departure,
what's your ride Iike?

00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,708

We've got some rough chop,
l'd say moderate to...

167
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:35,884
l'd say severe turbulence,
definitely severe turbulence.

168
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,012
No meal service today.

169
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,227

00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,911
Damn it, l'm tired of this shit.

173
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,955
-What are you doing?
-Leveling off.

174
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,999
-What?
-You see that little sliver of black

175
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,959
between those two ugly clouds?

176
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,628
That's a pocket of smooth air
squatting right over Kissimmee.

177
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,005
We're gonna thread the needle.

178
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,590
Turn us right, 30 degrees.

179
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,677
Departure, SouthJet 227,
we need to deviate 30 degrees right.

180
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,764
For weather.

181
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,266
SouthJet 227,
30 degrees right approved.

182
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,642
Report back on course.

183
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,935
Oh, Lord.

184
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,063
He can't help you now, brother.

185
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,777
SouthJet 227, say aItitude.

186
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,112
-What should l say?
-Tell him we're climbing.

187
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:42,951
Departure, we're leaving niner thousand
for flight level 1 80.

188
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,079
Roger, 227.

189
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,830
We're approaching
our maximum airspeed.

190
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,208
You're damn right. We need the speed
to punch through this crap.

191
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,334
Just work with me.

192
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,668
You're over speeding, sir.

193
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,588
Trying to get out of this shitty air,
if that's all right with you, junior.

194
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,466
SouthJet 227, Orlando,
you need to check your Mode C.

195
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,134
Your transponder indicates
you're descending.

196
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,178
Departure, this is SouthJet 227.

197
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,640
We're experiencing some rough air,
encountering some severe downdrafts.

198
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,141
We're in our climb now. Over.

199
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,394
Roger, 227.

200
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,770
Sir, look at your airspeed.

201
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,188
You're way too fast for this rough air!

202
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,315
l'm right on the line. Settle down.

203
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,490
Come on, sweetheart, show me the sun.

204
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,881
Yeah!

205
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,008
Daylight.

206
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,727
Thank God that's over.

207
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,904
All right, turn us north.
Take us home. Your plane.

208
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,322
My plane.

209
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,533
Margaret, l'm coming out.

210
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,391
Shit, Fran!

211
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,018
Hey, Nicole.

212
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,228
That's a nice camera.

213
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,399
You know, you're like a little ghost.

214
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,401
'Cause l never know when you're here.

215
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,529
Don't ever fucking touch my camera!
Now get out!

216
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,864
Hey! Now, as the building manager,

217
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,741
l got a legal right to enter an apartment,

218
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,368
especially if l feel
the occupant to be unwell

219
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,579
and the occupant
is not current on her rent.

220
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,247
Just give me a minute.

221
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,291
All right. l have your rent.

222
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,418
l will bring it down to you, okay?

223
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,879
Just let me take a shower.

224
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,089
You shower at my house.

225
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,426
You know, bring that money down,
we can shower together.

226
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,221
l got that good water pressure.

227
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:08,931
You know that.

228
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,602
You're in the perfect light there, Franny.

229
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,686
Yeah?

230
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,772
-Back up a little.
-Okay.

231
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,107
A little more.

232
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,447
All right. Okay. That's tricky, tricky, girl.

233
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,284
So you just shower up
and come on down.

234
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,119
ln your fucking dreams.

235
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,392
Good morning, Iadies and gentIemen,
I'm Captain Whitaker.

236
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,894
If you Iook up,
you'II see me here in the forward gaIIey.

237
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,312
I'II wave to you.

238
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,025
I want to apoIogize
for the bumps this morning.

239
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,112
EvidentIy, FIorida
doesn't Iike us Georgians.

240
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,822
Maybe it has something to do with

241
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,825
the beating the BuIIdogs
put on the Gators Iast faII.

242
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,453
I'm going to ask you
just to stretch out and reIax.

243
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,080
The air might get a IittIe cranky,

244
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,873
so we're gonna ask that
you remain in your seats

245
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,668
with your seatbeIts
secureIy fastened around you.

246
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,211
We won't have beverage service today,

247
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,046
but the flight attendants
wiII be going through the cabin

248
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,631
with water and with snacks.

249
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,675
We'II have you
on the ground in AtIanta in 40 minutes.

250
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:27,801
Thank you.

251
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,227
Hey, Nicole, open up!

252
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,021
Oh, fuck, Nicole, l know you're in there!

253
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,439
l can smell that shit cooking!

254
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,817
You better not
be burning down my fucking building!

255
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,574
How can anybody sleep like that?

256
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,412
l don't know.

257
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,247
And how long has
Sleeping Beauty been out?

258
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,290
Twenty-six minutes.

259
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,419
We're gonna
start descending any second now.

260
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,295
Well, looks like
you'll need to wake him up.

261
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,131
SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center.

262
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,133
Descend and maintain flight IeveI 300.

263
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,430
Descend and maintain
flight level 300, SouthJet 227.

264
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,729
What is that?

265
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,397
The elevator feels really stiff, sir.

266
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,773
All right, don't force it.

267
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,359
All right. Margaret,
get everybody strapped in.

268
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,569
That came from the back.

269
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:51,820
Get everybody strapped in tight.

270
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:54,990
Ladies and gentIemen...

271
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,491
lt's pulling left hard, sir.

272
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,001
Power back. Power back!

273
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:10,338
Sink rate. PuII up.

274
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,841
Ladies and gentlemen,
fasten your seatbelts now.

275
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,177
Fasten your seatbeIts secureIy now!

276
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,803
l have no control on my side.

277
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:17,929
No control at all, sir.

278
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,264
We've lost hydraulics.

279
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,016
Center, this is SouthJet 227.

280
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,227
We've lost our hydraulics
and it feels like our pitch control.

281
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,687
SouthJet 227, Atlanta...

282
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,981
Turn on the backup pumps.
The backup pumps.

283
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:31,026
That is affirm.
We are in an uncontrolled...

284
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,572
SouthJet 227, Atlanta.
Say your intentions.

285
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,782
Are you decIaring an emergency?

286
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,366
Everybody's belted in.
Are we going down?

287
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:39,451
Get belted in.

288
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,535
We need everybody in brace positions.

289
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,579
Yes. That is affirm. We are in a dive!

290
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:46,041
We are in a dive!
We have lost vertical control.

291
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,375
We're gonna need drag.

292
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:48,752
l want you to throw out
everything you got,

293
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,378
the speed brakes, the gear, everything.

294
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,005
Gear! Speed brakes!

295
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,220
Brace position.

296
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,473
Head down! Bend forward!
Head down, bend forward!

297
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,016
Gear's down.

298
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,309
l don't think hydraulics
is the problem, sir.

299
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,144
We need to dump the fuel. Do it!

300
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,730
All right.

301
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,069
Atlanta Center, this is SouthJet 227.

302
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,489
We're in an uncontrolled dive
descending out of 21 ,000 feet.

303
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,241
We're declaring an emergency.

304
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,408
We've dumped our fuel.

305
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,285
We've got a jammed
stabilizer or something.

306
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,412
We need a block
of altitude to work the problem

307
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,164
and a heading to the nearest airport.

308
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,332
SouthJet 227...

309
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,167
l can't hold it. Dump the flaps.

310
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,502
-Dump the flaps.
-We're still fast.

311
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,254
Just do it. Do it. Thirty degrees.

312
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,005
Turn Ieft, heading 315.

313
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,757
31 5, we'll try our best.

314
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,342
All right, that bought us a little time.

315
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,426
That bought us a little time.

316
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,011
Now we got to revert to manual control.

317
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,096
Your side first.

318
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,514
Okay, got it.

319
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,267
Nothing. No control.

320
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,061
Oh, no, we're diving again!

321
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,272
PuII up. Sink rate.

322
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,606
Damn it.

323
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,191
All right. Okay, okay, look.

324
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,735
l can't let go of my side.
See if you can reach my side.

325
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,446
l can't reach it, sir.

326
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,532
Just... No, stay strapped in.
Stay strapped in.

327
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,117
Margaret! Margaret!

328
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,536
Oh, God.

329
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,874
We're out of 1 5,000.

330
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,876
God, Whip, what's happening?

331
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,335
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

332
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,879
Get strapped into the jump seat there.

333
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,046
l need you to do something for me.

334
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,464
We're at 1 29!

335
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,966
SouthJet 227, Atlanta.

336
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,634
-FueI dump is approved.
-Thank you.

337
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,476
Cami!

338
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,228
Cami! Sit back down!

339
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,480
No, Cami, sit down!

340
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,982
I see you're going beIow 10,000.

341
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,650
-How are you doing?
-Not good. Not good.

342
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,987
Margaret, there's a red lever
right there next to my seat.

343
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,906
lt says "manual control." You see it?

344
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,073
-Yeah.
-Okay.

345
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,576
On the count of three,
l want you to pull it up,

346
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,328
turn it clockwise, push it back down.

347
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,831
Ready? One, two, three.

348
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:52,500
Oh, God.

349
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,586
That's okay, it's okay.

350
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,504
Come on.

351
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,174
All right, okay, okay, okay.

352
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,675
Here we go. We got something.

353
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,093
Shit!

354
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,932
Cami! Cami!

355
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,517
Margaret!

356
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,937
Oh, Lord, we're coming out at 7,000!

357
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,563
l see nothing but houses!

358
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,106
Evans! Listen to me.

359
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,858
When l say l want you
to retract the flaps,

360
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,945
retract the gear,
trim us nose down, okay?

361
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,279
But everything's gonna be opposite,

362
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,365
so make sure you trim us nose down.

363
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,866
Wait, trim down?
What are you going to do?

364
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,951
-Margaret.
-Yeah.

365
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,285
When l tell you l want you
to push these forward,

366
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,703
full power, full throttle. Can you do that?

367
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,788
Yeah. Okay.

368
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:30,872
-Okay, when l tell you.
-Wait, wait, sir.

369
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,248
What are we doing?
Why would l trim down?

370
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,750
We're going to roll it, okay?

371
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:34,876
What do you mean "Roll it"?

372
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,378
We gotta do something to stop this dive.

373
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,004
Margaret, what's your son's name?

374
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,798
-Trevor.
-Say, "l love you, Trevor."

375
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:40,882
-What?
-Black box.

376
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:41,967
Say, "l love you, Trevor."

377
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,636
l love you, Trevor.
You be a good boy. Mommy loves you.

378
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,888
Okay, here we go. l've got control.

379
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,725
Oh, Lord Jesus!

380
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,146
-All right, Evans, flaps.
-Flaps!

381
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,565
-Speed brakes.
-Speed brakes!

382
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,243
Margaret! Power!

383
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,081
-Gear up.
-Gear up!

384
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,099
Jesus, fuck!

385
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:32,434
Shit!

386
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,436
Oh, Lord Jesus, we're inverted!

387
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,021
We're flying. Listen, we're level.

388
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,605
We can maintain altitude like this.

389
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,191
SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center.
I see your position.

390
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,777
Four and a haIf miIes
southeast of the airport at 1,800.

391
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:43,862
Are you okay?

392
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:47,115
Atlanta Center, this is SouthJet 227.
We are inverted.

393
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,700
l repeat, we are inverted.

394
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,369
SouthJet 227, did you say inverted?

395
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,620
We're losing oil pressure!

396
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,705
Pump failure, both engines!

397
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,290
We're all right. We're flying.

398
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,587
Come on, baby.

399
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,299
Oh, my God. Please.

400
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,218
-Fire in the left engine!
-Put it out.

401
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,641
l'm right here.
Look at me, l'm right here.

402
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,394
Atlanta, SouthJet 227,
where's that airport?

403
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,897
227, it's one o'clock, three miles.

404
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,150
All right. We're not gonna make that.
Our engines are burning up.

405
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,152
l see a field and a road ahead of us.

406
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,320
We're gonna set it down there.

407
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,738
Roger, 227.

408
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,823
Oh, no, fire in the right now!

409
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,492
Evans, we're coming back around.

410
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,160
Margaret, l want you to hit full power.

411
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,703
Full throttle, you understand?

412
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,163
Here we go.

413
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,499
Evans, speed brakes.

414
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,833
Speed brakes!

415
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,585
-Flaps full.
-Flaps full!

416
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,009
Cami!

417
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,970
Oh, my God.

418
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,021
We're losing the left engine.

419
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,857
SouthJet 227,
I see you descending through 1,000.

420
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:03,942
Do you concur?

421
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,276
Margaret, full power.

422
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,789
We lost the left engine!

423
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,207
Let it roll.

424
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,126
We're losing power in the right!

425
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,171
We lost all power!

426
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:30,718
Too Iow. Terrain.

427
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,137
Are we gliding?

428
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,847
Too Iow. Terrain.

429
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,224
We're gliding. Pitch for glide.

430
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,226
Too Iow. Terrain.

431
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,399
One hundred.

432
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,322
Fifty.

433
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,909
Forty.

434
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,327
Thirty.

435
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,163
Twenty.

436
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,081
-Brace.
-Ten. Minimums.

437
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,499
-Brace for impact.
-Minimums.

438
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,849
l got the pilot!

439
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,434
Somebody give me a hand here!

440
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,770
Oh, my God!

441
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,068
Charlie Anderson?

442
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,407
-Hey.
-Hey.

443
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:42,410
How you feeling, Whip?

444
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,583
lnitial reports look like you pulled
some kind of move up there, man.

445
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,543
You saved a lot of lives.

446
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,046
How many?

447
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,758
The 1 02 souls on board,
including the flight crew,

448
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,885
96 of them survived the crash.

449
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,389
Six people died.

450
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,725
Two crew, four passengers.

451
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,729
Who on the crew?

452
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,902
Listen, the protocol is...

453
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,320
Who on the crew, Charlie?

454
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,198
The protocol is
that the NTSB has to be the first

455
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,741
to make contact with you. l can't...

456
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,577
And that agent's here, so

457
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,081
let me go get him. lt's a bit of a show.

458
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,249
So, just... There's half a dozen of them.

459
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,085
All right?

460
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,590
Hey, Craig, come on in.

461
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,814
Captain William Whitaker?

462
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,651
Nod if you can hear me
and understand me.

463
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,654
l'm Craig Matson from the NT... NTSB.

464
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,657
And l am required
as the lead on the Go Team

465
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,075
to make initial contact with you

466
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,328
after a major incident
like the one you had today.

467
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,499
You are in a hospital in South Atlanta.

468
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,504
Are you aware that
the plane you were piloting went down?

469
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:23,094
l have a doctor here who can explain
your medical situation.

470
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,346
l'm Dr. Kenan.

471
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,516
And the good news is
you're in good condition.

472
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,684
You did suffer a concussion,

473
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,854
you have numerous lacerations
around your left eye.

474
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,355
We're going to
keep the patch on for a few days.

475
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,940
Just as a precaution.

476
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,859
Your eye seems to be okay.

477
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,112
Now, the MRls show
that you have some strained tendons

478
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,864
in your left knee and ankle,

479
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,199
and you have no broken bones.

480
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,285
But you have some
deep bruising in your left thigh

481
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,871
and some torn ligaments
in your left wrist.

482
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:51,831
Nothing serious.

483
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,958
So, as soon as we clear
your concussion

484
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,710
and you feel well enough,
you can go home.

485
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:59,839
That may take a day,
maybe three. Okay?

486
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,346
l won't ask too much of you tonight,

487
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:12,226
but as l said, the NTSB is
required to make initial contact.

488
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,898
How much do you remember
about the flight?

489
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,569
l remember...

490
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,407
l remember everything up till the crash.

491
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:27,825
Okay.

492
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,911
Mr. Whitaker, that's fine.

493
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:33,289
l am required
to inform you that this incident

494
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,082
did result in the loss of life.

495
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,586
The current information states that

496
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:42,507
of the 1 02 souls on board, we lost six.

497
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,926
Two crew members
and four passengers.

498
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,345
Fifty-nine people
were treated and released,

499
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,596
37 people remain...

500
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,765
Who did we lose on the crew?

501
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,767
The two flight attendants,

502
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,312
Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez.

503
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,733
The rep from your pilots' union,

504
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,110
Mr. Anderson, will be
our contact for you.

505
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,197
lt's important that
you follow your union's guidance

506
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,032
on press and media.

507
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,285
The pilots' union works
closely with the NTSB.

508
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,288
So, l'm going to head out.

509
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,706
l'll turn this off.

510
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,959
-Good luck, Mr. Whitaker.
-Thank you.

511
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,807
l knew Trina Marquez. She was...

512
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,977
We spent some time together.

513
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,813
Yeah, apparently,
she wasn't strapped in.

514
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,692
A survivor reported
she was assisting a kid.

515
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,653
Margaret Thomason, how's she doing?

516
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:48,239
Broken collarbone, just, l mean, cuts.

517
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,408
l mean, she's banged up, but she's...

518
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,326
She's here, too. She's fine.

519
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,704
And Ken Evans, your copilot,

520
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,040
he took a bad shot to the head.

521
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,086
And they're keeping him in a coma
just to let the brain swelling go down,

522
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,504
but we feel good about him.

523
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,798
He's going to be okay.

524
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,511
What are you doing here, Charlie?

525
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,473
l'm flying a desk now.

526
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,767
l'm a rep for the pilots' union.

527
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,185
You're the rep for the pilots' union?

528
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,563
Yeah, l'm one of them.
When your plane went down,

529
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,983
all the reps got a page
and l just shot up my hand,

530
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,820
'cause l know you, said l wanted to
come be the first face you'd see.

531
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,364
l'm glad you're here.

532
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,701
The union's gonna
release a statement on your behalf,

533
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,995
condolences to the families
who lost loved ones,

534
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,040
gratitude to the brave men
and women of the flight crew.

535
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,834
That's... You don't have
to worry about that.

536
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,087
And l know you and Deana have
been divorced for a while now,

537
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,881
but maybe she
and your son, Will, wanna...

538
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,883
Yeah, Knuckles...

539
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,553
How old is he now?

540
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,889
Too old. Fifteen.

541
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,058
-Fifteen? Wow.
-Yeah.

542
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,603
When we were flying for Delta,
you weren't even married.

543
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,189
We're dinosaurs, Whip.

544
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,903
Do you want me to reach out to Deana?

545
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,280
And see if she and Will
want to come down...

546
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:14,784
No, no. l'll... l'll call them.

547
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,868
All right.

548
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,870
Well, speaking of which,
l got your phone.

549
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:21,082
And a whole bunch of
other personal effects from the plane.

550
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,125
Your clothes are toast.

551
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,629
Do you...

552
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:30,716
Do you need me
to get you some stuff, or...

553
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,468
l'm okay.

554
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,262
Charlie, l'm...

555
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,767
l'm glad you came.

556
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,311
Me, too. l'm happy to be here.

557
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,940
All right, well, l'm going to...

558
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,151
l'll let you get some rest.
But l'll come back.

559
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,486
l mean, you're going
to see plenty of me.

560
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:51,946
l'm sure you will.

561
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:57,159
The plane was fucked, Charlie.
lt was doomed.

562
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,787
l know.

563
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:03,499
And the way you landed that plane
was nothing short of a miracle.

564
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:05,835
Know that.

565
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:08,754
Okay, man?

566
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,464
All right, cowboy.

567
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,894
God. Damn.

568
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,364
God damn it.

569
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,353
l'm on the list, baby girl. Mr. Mays.

570
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,606
Harling.

571
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,945
lf this is going to
turn into a sponge bath,

572
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,197
l'll come back later.

573
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,364
-Sir.
-lt's okay.

574
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,826
That's all right, honey,
l'm on the list. Harling Mays.

575
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,078
Some say they "Harling" knew me.

576
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:25,623
Honey, could you hustle us up
a couple of daiquiris

577
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:26,874
and a cocktail weenie?

578
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,167
On second thought,
just bring the booze,

579
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,251
l brought my own weenie.

580
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,879
Oh, she's offended and she should be.

581
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,881
l'm a pig. And l hate me.

582
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,050
That's what
we have in common, Nurse Ratched.

583
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,552
We both hate me.

584
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,930
Harling Mays.

585
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,934
Whip, what the fuck, my man?

586
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:49,772
They're saying, "Sweet Jesus,
what a stud that pilot is."

587
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,190
You're a hero, man.

588
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,276
You will never pay
for another drink as long as you live.

589
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:57,196
There is all kinds
of crazy news people out here.

590
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,531
lt's a fucking circus, man.

591
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,450
Come on, check this shit out, man.
lt's all for you.

592
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,244
Look at this shit.

593
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,454
Classic hero worship shit.

594
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,583
You're a rock star, man.
Oh, check out this video.

595
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,877
This is outside your condo. lt's a zoo.

596
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,129
lt's crawling with reporters.

597
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,631
Let's see. Check this out.

598
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,299
So you do know Captain Whitaker.
You are friends.

599
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,218
Oh, yeah. Yes, he's my brother.

600
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,637
That's me and that's Mark Mellon,

601
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:25,057
you know, that douchey talking haircut
from local Atlanta Channel 1 2.

602
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,726
l said a few words, you know,
mostly straight talk.

603
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,646
You okay, Captain Whitaker?

604
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,481
The meds they're giving me,
they're messing me up.

605
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,442
l'm all shaky and dried out,
l can't sleep good.

606
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,987
Meds? What the hell
kind of meds are they giving you?

607
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:39,822
Alprazolam?

608
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,615
That's generic Xanax.

609
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,159
Hydrocodone, that's generic Vicodin.
lt's shit.

610
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,954
Probably Canadian.
We don't want this shit.

611
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,582
We want the premium stuff,
the blue label,

612
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,916
not this fucking well shit.

613
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,918
l mean,
where's the dihydromorphinone?

614
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,045
Or at least some
fucking Palladone, for Christ's sake.

615
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,214
ls this amateur hour?
Get that doctor in here.

616
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,340
You just saved 1 00 people...

617
00:36:58,425 --> 00:36:59,508
Harling!

618
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,344
-You bring my smokes?
-Yes, l did.

619
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,470
l got your fucking message,

620
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,599
and, yes,
l got your fucking smokes right here.

621
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:07,683
Here's a fresh carton.

622
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,060
You smoke your nuts off, champion.

623
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,771
Hell, if l was you, l'd fire up right
here in the goddamn room.

624
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,857
Here. l got you a pint of vodka,

625
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,400
l got you some Red Bulls.
You know what l'm saying?

626
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,484
l know my customer.

627
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,153
Take the vodka with you.

628
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,613
What... Take the vodka? What are you...

629
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,031
l'm not drinking anymore.
Take it with you.

630
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,449
l'll just tuck it...

631
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,659
-Take the fucking vodka with you.
-Okay. All right.

632
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,913
Listen, but you
got to come get me tomorrow. Okay?

633
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:31,957
And...

634
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,376
l want you to go by my condo,

635
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:39,214
pick me up some clothes
and my phone charger.

636
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,674
Look in my refrigerator

637
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,218
and pick up a package
that says "veal" on it.

638
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,887
-lt's marked "veal."
-Veal.

639
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,305
ln the freezer. lt's marked "veal."

640
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,057
Done and done.
What time do you want me here?

641
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:49,141
l'll call you.

642
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,267
Okay. You give a mayday,

643
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,227
you're out of here in seven minutes. Oh!

644
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,105
Oh, l almost forgot.
l got you some stroke mags.

645
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,191
l've been in the hospital before,
l know what you need.

646
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,027
l got Juggs,
Hot MILFs in Heat, AssMasters.

647
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,071
You just stroke it all day, you're a hero.

648
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,948
lf l was you,

649
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,450
l'd just lay here
pulling on that thing all day long.

650
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,620
You know what l'm saying?
There's a smile. Yes, sir.

651
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,436
Damn it.

652
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,018
Devious minds think alike.

653
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,604
Don't go.

654
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,983
l'll be quiet and just...

655
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:23,777
lt's nice to

656
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,572
just sit and smoke with somebody.

657
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,329
Were you on that plane?

658
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,832
Yeah, l was.

659
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,292
You?

660
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,628
You must have been sitting at the back.

661
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,134
Yeah, way in the back.

662
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,511
Tobacco's but an Indian weed

663
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,097
Grows green in the morn
Cut down in the eve

664
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:55,350
Shows our decay 'cause we are but cIay

665
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,812
l love the smell
of nicotine in the morning.

666
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,691
lt smells like victory.

667
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,693
Can l bum one?

668
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,449
l should quit.

669
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,243
My cancer might get cancer.

670
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,081
Joke.

671
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,500
Were you in the plane crash?

672
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,793
He was.

673
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,380
Holy shit, man! You're the fucking pilot!

674
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,842
What happened up there?

675
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,554
Okay. Yeah. l'd...

676
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,849
Tough deal, man, but you walked away.

677
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,601
Or you limped away.

678
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,938
Yeah, l'm lucky. Going home tomorrow.

679
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:42,523
Home?

680
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,608
Home for me is the basement.

681
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,944
They keep cancer treatment
in the basement.

682
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,987
What kind of cancer you got?

683
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,157
Fibromyxoid sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma.

684
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,701
Very rare. God chose me.

685
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,745
You believe that?

686
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,164
Fuck, yeah, bitch.

687
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,750
You're a stupid fucker
if you don't believe in God.

688
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,336
Once you realize all the random
events in your life are God,

689
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,755
you will live a much easier life.

690
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,424
We spend all our time
trying to control all these things

691
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,218
that happen to us, it's bullshit.

692
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,387
The plane you're flying goes down?

693
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,513
Out of your control.

694
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,432
God gives you cancer?
l got no control over that.

695
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,809
Did God give me cancer?

696
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,853
You bet your ass God gave me cancer.

697
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,020
You know, do you think

698
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,897
God would have
given me cancer if l'd asked for it?

699
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,482
l don't think so,

700
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,360
'cause l begged him
to take it away and guess what?

701
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,155
No control over that, either.

702
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,033
What are you doing here, honey?

703
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,368
You're beautiful, you know that?

704
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,413
Do l scare you?

705
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:45,252
People are either drawn to me,
or they pretend like they can't see me.

706
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:47,963
lt's a trip.

707
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,756
They think because
l'm close to the other side,

708
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,009
l got some sort of power or wisdom.

709
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,719
Like l got all the answers.

710
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,554
l don't know, maybe l do.

711
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,267
Death gives you perspective.
lt all makes sense, somehow.

712
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,145
And l just
can't get over how beautiful you are.

713
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,274
l can see your arm. Are you an addict?

714
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,111
Yeah.

715
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,113
What's your name?

716
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,449
Nicole.

717
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:17,993
What do you do in the world, Nicole?

718
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,454
Not much.

719
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,957
l was a photographer,
and then l was a masseuse,

720
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,127
and now l sometimes
wash hair in a salon.

721
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,296
Oh, yeah? Where is it?

722
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:32,299
l'm gonna come by. l'm real easy,
you just wash my head.

723
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,970
You think you're going to die?

724
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,442
Don't you just love her?

725
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,945
Don't know her.

726
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:55,489
Bullshit. l do.

727
00:42:56,658 --> 00:43:00,244
Random act of God? l don't think so.

728
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:04,248
You survive a plane crash
to meet a beautiful woman in a stairwell.

729
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,167
Fuck you, man.

730
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,506
Probably looking for me.

731
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,883
My family just flew in from Utah.

732
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,344
You know it's bad
when they start flying in.

733
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,473
lt's a trip.

734
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,184
'Cause every morning is special now.

735
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,520
l'm grateful for that.

736
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,856
l wish l could bottle
this feeling that l have

737
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:33,193
about how beautiful
every last breath of life is.

738
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,366
You think l could get one more,
just for the road?

739
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,493
Here. Take the pack.

740
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,208
Thank you.

741
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,794
l'll pass these out in the cancer ward.

742
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,339
Nicole. You're going to be okay.

743
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,265
Chemo brain.

744
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,226
Makes you pretty foggy.

745
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,644
Oh, yeah?

746
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,396
They call it chemo brain.

747
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,567
My momma, she used
to slur her words and get all chatty.

748
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,736
Your mom had cancer?

749
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,406
Breast cancer. She was only 54.

750
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:23,076
ls that why you think you're going to die?

751
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,665
Heroin addicts who use needles,
they tend to die.

752
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,084
Especially women, for some reason.

753
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,420
l read that in a pamphlet.

754
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,925
A woman from AA, she just came
to see me whilst l was in rehab.

755
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,096
That guy was a trip, huh?

756
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,765
Yeah.

757
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,892
He made it feel like, l don't know.

758
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,772
Like you and me
were the last people left on this planet.

759
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,777
And together we'll save the world.

760
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,999
Where do you live, Nicole?

761
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:14,795
Why? You want to come visit me?
lt's luxurious.

762
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,798
l live in Bankhead, near the bus station.

763
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,466
l'll come visit you.

764
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,426
-You're sweet.
-l will.

765
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,137
What's your address?

766
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,809
l live at the Georgian Terraces,
on Taylor Street.

767
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,060
Okay.

768
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,772
And you say you're a masseuse?
What kind of masseuse?

769
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,984
l've been every kind
of masseuse there is.

770
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,447
Good luck, Nicole.

771
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:50,747
l couldn't find any suitcases.

772
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,165
l put all your shit in garbage bags.

773
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,667
No, thanks.

774
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:59,172
You're staying with me
down on University, right?

775
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,174
lt's nice.

776
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,052
A lot of young people. Good vibe.

777
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,347
No, l'm going to the farm.

778
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,016
Farm?

779
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:12,519
l can't stay at my condo.

780
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,105
l thought you sold your dad's place.

781
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,314
Not yet.

782
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,486
l'm not sure l want to stay at the farm.

783
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,697
You're not.
You're just gonna drive me to the airport

784
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,407
so l can pick up my car.

785
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:27,701
"Veal"?

786
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,619
Really.

787
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:48,114
Captain Whitaker, this is Jim Court,
I'm with CNN. We'd Iike...

788
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:52,160
This is the NBC affiIiate in Athens.
We're Iooking to...

789
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,919
In the wake of the deadIy
crash of SouthJet flight 227,

790
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,671
we have more questions than answers

791
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,548
as to what exactIy happened that day.

792
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,800
And Iike many,
we are out Iooking for answers.

793
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,803
Looking here at the home of piIot
Captain WiIIiam "Whip" Whitaker.

794
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,222
We stiII have no sighting
and no comments

795
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,432
from the Captain himseIf.

796
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:03,518
This is Mark MeIIon, stiII on the hunt,
from midtown AtIanta.

797
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,062
You've reached
the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company,

798
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:07,981
flying Iessons and pIane rides.

799
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,234
PIease Ieave a message
and it wiII be returned. Thank you.

800
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,697
Hey, cowboy. It's Charlie again.

801
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:19,743
Listen, I'm back in town
and I stopped by the hospitaI tonight,

802
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:21,619
but they said you'd gone home,

803
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:23,913
so you must be feeIing pretty good.

804
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:27,667
Listen, l went out to your condo

805
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,586
and the manager said
you had not returned,

806
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,839
so you may be with relatives,
which l understand,

807
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,632
but l know you have
a doctor's appointment

808
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,092
early in the morning for your eye,

809
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:39,012
and l was just hoping
that you could meet us for breakfast.

810
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:42,766
About 1 0:00 at the St. Regis,
there's an executive buffet there.

811
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,560
And we'll be
covering some pretty important stuff,

812
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,521
so it'd be nice to have you there.

813
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,774
All right. Be good.

814
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:17,801
Oh, there he is.

815
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,803
Hey, Whip. Hey, buddy.
Man, you look good.

816
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:20,887
l feel good.

817
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:21,971
Thanks for coming.
Glad you got my message.

818
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,556
-How's your eye?
-Good, good.

819
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,809
This is Hugh Lang,
he's an attorney from Chicago.

820
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,393
-Pleasure to meet you, Captain.
-My pleasure.

821
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,729
-Sit down. You want a coffee?
-Yes, l do.

822
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,065
-Could we have some fresh coffee?
-Yes, sir.

823
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,318
We were just talking
about your copilot's wife.

824
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,238
Told a newspaper that
"God landed that plane."

825
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,657
Yeah? Oh, God landed that plane?

826
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,617
Well, l do believe God landed the plane.

827
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,285
Same way l believe
God should hit the buffet,

828
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,246
the turkey sausage is excellent.

829
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,164
l'm fine with coffee, thank you.

830
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,750
So, Len Caldwell
really wanted to get here this morning.

831
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,085
Len's the president of the pilots' union.

832
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,337
He wanted to be here
to meet with us and you,

833
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,589
but they need him at the crash site.

834
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,675
As you know, when a plane goes down,

835
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:01,845
the NTSB sends a Go Team
to the crash site immediately.

836
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,680
They find the flight data recorder?

837
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:04,931
They did. lt's perfectly intact.

838
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,099
Oh, great. Great, great, great.

839
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,433
Then that solves everything.

840
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:10,854
So why do we need
a lawyer from Chicago?

841
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:14,399
Well, Hugh specializes
in criminal negligence.

842
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,359
Criminal negligence?

843
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,736
Death demands responsibility.

844
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,864
Six dead on that plane,
someone has to pay.

845
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,491
Yeah, but that's a plane
that fell apart at...

846
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,410
Thank you. Fell apart at 30,000 feet.

847
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,996
The airline will try
to prove equipment failure,

848
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,747
which is gonna make
the manufacturer responsible.

849
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,666
The manufacturer in turn
is gonna try and prove

850
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,918
poor maintenance
of the equipment by the airline.

851
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:35,628
Or pilot error.

852
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,757
l flew the plane inverted,
that means upside down, Hugh.

853
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:44,262
You get the picture? A hundred people,
upside down, 500 feet off the ground.

854
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,972
Do you have any idea what that's like?

855
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,892
l do. l heard the black box
recordings last night.

856
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,727
Oh, you heard. Are you a pilot?

857
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:51,769
No, l'm not.

858
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,688
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, do you?

859
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,731
Hugh's on our team, Whip.

860
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,982
-ls he?
-Yeah, he is.

861
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,442
-He doesn't act like he's on our team.
-Well, he is.

862
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,068
Asking me questions
about fucking pilot error.

863
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,737
Listen, it's the NTSB's ball game.

864
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,238
They run the investigation.

865
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:04,490
And they will ultimately
rule on the cause.

866
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:05,742
And that's why we need him.

867
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:08,244
Well, they interview
the entire flight crew.

868
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:13,082
They interview the passengers.
They hold public hearings.

869
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,417
All right, let's cut to the chase.

870
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,252
Just tell me
what it is l need to know, Charlie.

871
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:21,382
The NTSB Go Team also collects
blood, hair and skin samples

872
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:25,511
from the entire flight crew for
the purposes of a toxicology report.

873
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:28,139
Okay. When do they want to do that?

874
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,142
They've already done that.
ln the hospital.

875
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,977
lt's the first thing they do.

876
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,481
You don't remember having
your blood drawn the night of the crash?

877
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:37,899
-No.
-No.

878
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,198
They get the results of this test?

879
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,075
Yeah, they do.

880
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,285
Anything else for you gentlemen?

881
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:52,163
Yeah. You had warm cinnamon buns
over there, right?

882
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,247
Yes, sir.

883
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:54,457
-Could you get me one of those, please?
-Sure.

884
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,583
ln fact, get me two of them.

885
00:54:55,668 --> 00:54:57,043
-Yes, sir. Coming up.
-Thank you, sweetie.

886
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,421
Now, an initial report shows that

887
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,049
you had alcohol in your system

888
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,927
at a level of .24.

889
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,304
Now in the good old U.S. ofA.,

890
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:11,307
one of the most lenient
drunk driving countries in the world,

891
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:14,727
you go to jail for driving
with anything above .08.

892
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:17,605
And by driving, l mean a car.

893
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,524
Thank you.

894
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:23,111
So... That doesn't mean anything.

895
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:24,988
l had a couple of beers
the night before the flight.

896
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,781
That made the tail of the plane explode?

897
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,075
-A couple of beers?
-Yeah, a couple of beers.

898
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,785
You know, l need a lawyer, Charlie.

899
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,370
-Hugh is your lawyer.
-l need a bigger lawyer.

900
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,289
l need a lawyer that understands
that someone put me in a broken plane.

901
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:38,292
Without me up there, there would have
been 1 02 funerals, not six.

902
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,003
We're not talking
about funerals right now, Captain.

903
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:41,212
Well, then what are we talking about?

904
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,089
We're talking about prison time.

905
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,757
-What?
-Lawsuits.

906
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:47,468
-Somebody has to pay.
-What, write a check?

907
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,262
lt's not gonna be me, l promise you that.

908
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:52,181
As long as they're writing checks,
tell them to write one for me, too.

909
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,058
Because someone put me
in a broken plane.

910
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:55,518
l'd love a check, Charlie.

911
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,479
This toxicology report
states that you were drunk

912
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,982
and high on cocaine.

913
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,943
Felonies punishable by
up to 1 2 years in prison.

914
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,362
And if it is proven that your intoxication

915
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:08,281
was the cause of the death
of the four passengers,

916
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,159
now we're gonna look at
four counts of manslaughter.

917
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,578
That could be life in prison.

918
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:17,623
Now can l please
do my job on your behalf

919
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:20,334
and kill this tox report?

920
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,592
He's gonna get it done, Whip.
He'll get it done.

921
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,052
lt's what his whole life's about.

922
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,429
Trust me. Trust him.

923
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,391
You don't have to worry,
you'll walk away from this the hero.

924
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:37,143
l'm not worried, Charlie.

925
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,563
l promise you that l'm not worried.

926
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,691
No one could have landed
that plane like l did.

927
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:46,319
No one.

928
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,410
-Thanks for coming.
-Yeah.

929
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:55,912
Excuse me.

930
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,916
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

931
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,335
Yeah, let me have an orange juice.

932
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,753
Large orange juice.

933
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,671
Just orange juice?

934
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,841
Yeah. No.

935
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:12,345
Double Stoli. Neat.

936
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,014
It paints a picture to me anyway

937
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,850
of a reaI American hero.
Is that your reading of it?

938
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:22,271
AbsoIuteIy. However,
remember, every situation is different.

939
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:26,025
And the actions of
the piIots on SouthJet 227

940
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,527
wiII be heaviIy scrutinized.

941
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:30,655
Are you suggesting that there may be
more to this than meets the eye?

942
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:31,864
There aIways is.

943
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,324
You don't have aII the answers.

944
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,659
You do have a Iot of questions.

945
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:36,869
We're gonna have to wait untiI some
of those answers come in

946
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,871
before we can say much more.

947
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,999
Are you hinting here,
I don't want to put words in your mouth,

948
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:44,919
but are you hinting
that this is suspicious?

949
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,172
This accident is not
Iike any other accident.

950
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,878
And the next one will be

951
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:33,301
Taylor Street.

952
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,642
What the fuck, Nicole?

953
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,060
Get out!

954
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:26,687
The guy in unit 1
just told me you stayed here last night!

955
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,147
Franny, just relax.

956
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,690
l just want to get my shit out of here.

957
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:32,235
What about my rent?
You owe me money, bitch!

958
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,320
Don't touch me, Franny!

959
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,657
Fran, get off me.
Fran, get your hand off me!

960
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,909
What the fuck are you doing?
Get the fuck off her!

961
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,245
Keep your fucking hands off her!

962
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:48,793
You okay?

963
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,005
ls this all the rest of your stuff?

964
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,340
Yeah.

965
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,384
She still owes me $1 ,1 00!

966
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,927
-Plus damages!
-Shut up!

967
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,265
What, you want to sue her?

968
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,600
Spend 1 ,000 bucks, or you want to
make a cash deal with me?

969
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:06,060
Make up your mind.

970
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,020
Make up your mind!

971
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,315
l'll take 700 cash.

972
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:15,111
You're a hairy little creep, aren't you?

973
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,571
Some baseball bat bullshit.

974
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:23,160
Seven hundred, my ass.

975
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,204
There's 400 cash.

976
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,248
Now be a good boy,

977
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,126
grab that box and put it in her car.

978
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,503
My car, it don't run.

979
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:35,840
lt didn't start this morning.
l'm taking all this with me.

980
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,967
Your car doesn't run?

981
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,594
Well, what were you going to do?

982
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:42,680
Why...

983
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,766
l don't know what l was gonna do.

984
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:14,420
What's your name?

985
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:16,213
Whip.

986
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,011
What?

987
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:25,264
That's funny?

988
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,272
Thank you,

989
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,067
Captain Whip.

990
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:50,664
Hey.

991
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,042
You okay?

992
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,960
-Yeah. You?
-Yeah.

993
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,963
-You want a drink?
-No, thanks.

994
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,010
You sure it's all right that l stay here?

995
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,805
Yes, it's all right that you stay here.

996
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:08,265
l want you to stay.

997
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:12,686
That knee hurting you?

998
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,981
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

999
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:24,407
Oh. Thank you, Doctor.

1000
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,662
-lt's throbbing a little bit.
-Yeah.

1001
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:32,331
The blood's having
a hard time getting back to your heart.

1002
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,759
Feels good, though.

1003
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:04,423
You going to shoot me?
Or can l come inside?

1004
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,927
Yeah, come on inside.
l'll shoot you inside.

1005
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:14,183
Listen, l thought we'd take a ride.

1006
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,559
There's something l need to show you.

1007
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,438
Okay.

1008
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:26,111
There it is.

1009
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:32,451
You can see on initial impact,
the left wing hit the ground.

1010
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:34,954
Think if it would have
sheared off completely,

1011
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,706
everybody would have
walked away from this plane.

1012
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:42,628
The wing snapped off
and drove the engine cowling into

1013
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,964
-the rear fuselage.
-Yeah.

1014
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,092
lf you were sitting
in the last six or seven rows,

1015
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,469
it was like being hit by a train.

1016
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:52,555
Who are they?

1017
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:55,641
The John the Baptist
Pentecostal Mission.

1018
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,851
They helped pull survivors
out of the wreckage.

1019
01:04:57,978 --> 01:04:59,562
Now, they come out here every day.

1020
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:11,156
And that is Ellen Block.

1021
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,743
She's the head
of the NTSB investigation.

1022
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,913
She's the one that's gonna be asking
you the tough questions.

1023
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:19,582
l drank the night before the flight.

1024
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:20,833
l drank that morning, too.

1025
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,502
l used cocaine to help
straighten myself out.

1026
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:26,297
l know. lt's in the toxicology report.

1027
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,133
But that is
not the reason why this happened.

1028
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:31,343
No, it's not.

1029
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:33,929
Listen.

1030
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:37,266
Clearly, there was a mechanical issue
with the plane.

1031
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,309
Yeah, clearly.

1032
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:42,646
Yeah, but what you and l know,
this was an act of God.

1033
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,401
And l'm going to fight to get
the NTSB to add "Act of God"

1034
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,361
as one of the probable causes.

1035
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:52,197
Whose god would do this?

1036
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:01,248
Okay.

1037
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:03,083
So,

1038
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,544
here's the deal.

1039
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:09,798
Avington Carr, he's the owner
of the airline, he's on our side.

1040
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,009
He's got big friends in Washington, too.

1041
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:15,554
He wants to have a sit-down with us
tomorrow morning at 1 0:00.

1042
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,556
-Good.
-Yeah.

1043
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,893
You can't drink, Captain.

1044
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:23,812
You're under the microscope right now.

1045
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,814
You can't be seen buying liquor.

1046
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:28,400
That means no bars, no drugs...

1047
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:31,028
l understand.
l won't drink, l promise you.

1048
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,155
-Look, we can get you help...
-l don't need help.

1049
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:37,076
l won't drink, l promise you.
l can stop. On my own.

1050
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,412
-Okay.
-Okay.

1051
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,752
-Till 1 0:00.
-1 0:00, l got it.

1052
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,420
Avington Carr.

1053
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:51,382
l never wanted that fucking airline.

1054
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:54,677
Neither did my brother.
lt was my father that wanted it.

1055
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:57,346
-l like baseball.
-Oh, l like baseball.

1056
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:59,014
Everybody in Georgia likes baseball.

1057
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,516
The whole country likes baseball.

1058
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,809
Cut the crap.

1059
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:05,646
So, what's the deal, Lenny?

1060
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,107
ls your union going to survive this one?

1061
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:11,485
More importantly, how big a check
you think l'm gonna have to write?

1062
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,946
You had six fatalities
on board your aircraft.

1063
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,364
No, no, it's four, Lenny.

1064
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,658
The two crew members don't count.

1065
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,203
l don't mean they don't count.

1066
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,414
They don't get settlements
like the passengers.

1067
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:26,875
Okay, that's a workman's comp claim,
part of the union contract.

1068
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,461
They do a dangerous job. They know it.

1069
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,589
You the lawyer for the pilots' union?

1070
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,550
No, sir, this is Hugh Lang,

1071
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:35,884
he's the attorney we brought on

1072
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:38,679
to handle the criminal side
of Captain Whitaker's situation.

1073
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,475
Yes, and what is
Mr. Whitaker's situation?

1074
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:45,769
The NTSB is up my ass
with a flashlight.

1075
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:47,938
We had to give them
access to everything.

1076
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:50,065
Everybody's curious
about Captain Whitaker.

1077
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:53,152
Well, l flew with him
in the navy and he is a great pilot.

1078
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,322
ls he a drunk?

1079
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:02,411
He's a heavy drinker.

1080
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,829
But maybe l should bring him in...

1081
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,247
ln a minute.

1082
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,542
All right, so let's get down to it, Lenny.

1083
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:12,755
What does the union
plan to do about this blood test saying

1084
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:15,591
Whitaker was high on booze and coke?

1085
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,259
This guy's a real peach.

1086
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,053
l'm going to kill the toxicology report.

1087
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,432
The testing was done incompetently.

1088
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:28,645
The toxicology equipment they used
was last calibrated in June of 2009.

1089
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,106
lt's already 1 8 months past code.

1090
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,609
Their log, that should clearly state

1091
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:36,862
who labeled the blood vials,
and when, is very incomplete.

1092
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:39,740
And they used
a preservative in the blood

1093
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:42,618
that has been known
to cause fermentation,

1094
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:45,788
and in some cases,
register higher in an alcohol test.

1095
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,749
Now, l've done all this,
l've only been here a few days,

1096
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,502
so l wouldn't worry about it
too much. l can handle this.

1097
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:53,962
l like this guy, Lenny.

1098
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:57,424
Makes me want to go out
and sniff a few lines and fly a jet.

1099
01:08:57,509 --> 01:09:00,302
Mr. Carr,
we're going to fight to push all the fault

1100
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,346
onto the manufacturer,
Jackson Ridgefield.

1101
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:06,475
And you think they're gonna just open
their checkbook and buy us all lunch?

1102
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,227
Good fucking luck.

1103
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,771
What's my exposure, Jim?

1104
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:14,149
Well, the awards
to the families could kill the airline.

1105
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:15,359
Fuck the airline.

1106
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:17,528
The insurance companies
can have the goddamn airline.

1107
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:19,863
l just don't want them
to come sniffing in my other pockets.

1108
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:21,865
Speaking for the pilots' union, sir,

1109
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:24,159
we don't want to see
your airline go away.

1110
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:26,328
We enjoy the contract you have with us.

1111
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,080
We're gonna protect Captain Whitaker,

1112
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:30,666
and in turn, we're gonna
protect your airline.

1113
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:34,586
Does Whitaker know he's going to jail?

1114
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,964
My clients don't go to jail, Mr. Carr.

1115
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:40,008
He's going to jail. He belongs in jail.

1116
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:42,678
You bet your ass he's going to jail.
The only question is,

1117
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:44,847
is he going to die in jail?

1118
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,932
You're wrong, Mr. Carr.

1119
01:09:47,267 --> 01:09:48,225
Last time l checked,

1120
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:51,186
six counts
of manslaughter is life in prison.

1121
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:52,938
Life in prison.

1122
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:56,441
What we in Georgia call "all day long."

1123
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,660
l hear you're some kind of pilot.

1124
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:13,792
To the 40, to the 50! And touchdown!

1125
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:17,087
And Grandpa throws it, picks it up...

1126
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:19,131
Oh, Grandpa, what,
are you going to chase him now?

1127
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,009
Pick it up, Pop.

1128
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,176
Pick it up.

1129
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,140
Run it back! Run it back!
Come on, Knuckles!

1130
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,474
Let me see you cut.

1131
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:36,398
There she is, there she is.

1132
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:40,485
You back... To the meet?
At the nice meeting.

1133
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:45,657
l know, it's okay.

1134
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:54,499
Yep. That shit ain't...

1135
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,881
See?

1136
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:04,217
This shit...

1137
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,845
And my...

1138
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:10,432
Knuckles, he's my boy.

1139
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:14,186
He can play a game.

1140
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:17,481
He can play that game.

1141
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:18,607
You want to run the baII!

1142
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,609
You want to be a quarterback!
Let me see you run it back!

1143
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,153
Fake Dad out! Fake Grandpa out!

1144
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,030
Oh, Dad, where'd you get that arm?

1145
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:27,366
You must've got that
from Grandma's side.

1146
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,713
There's a flight.
We're gonna miss the flight.

1147
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:56,061
And he picks it up! TeII him, Dad.

1148
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,314
When are we going to
go flying, Dad? Soon?

1149
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:00,565
Soon.

1150
01:12:00,692 --> 01:12:02,484
You stiII want to get up there?

1151
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,111
Sure. Any time, son.

1152
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:06,029
AII right. Say hi, son.

1153
01:12:06,114 --> 01:12:08,156
AII right. Where's IittIe man KnuckIes?

1154
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,574
What's up, KnuckIes?

1155
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,035
Don't get shy.
Don't act Iike you don't know me.

1156
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,079
I'm your father. Say, "Hi, Dad."

1157
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:15,497
-Hi, Dad.
-What's your name?

1158
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,665
WiII.

1159
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,166
-What's your nickname?
-KnuckIes.

1160
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:19,292
What are you gonna be
when you grow up?

1161
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:21,169
-A piIot.
-There you go.

1162
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:23,588
You taught him weII, Dad. A piIot.

1163
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:26,091
Wait, wait, Iet me get that.

1164
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:28,093
-Say hi to Mom.
-Hi, Mom.

1165
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:30,303
What do you wanna teII Mom?
TeII her you Iove her.

1166
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:31,430
I Iove her.

1167
01:12:54,454 --> 01:12:56,455
-Morning.
-Good morning.

1168
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,962
You were in pretty bad shape last night.

1169
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,172
Yeah.

1170
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,966
Just tired. Oh!

1171
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:12,095
l drank a little bit too much.

1172
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:13,805
A bit?

1173
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:17,768
What, you want to count
the fucking beers?

1174
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,811
l threw them out.

1175
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:22,981
They're in the garbage. Vodka, too.

1176
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,401
That okay with you?

1177
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:29,237
-More than okay.
-Good.

1178
01:13:32,784 --> 01:13:36,119
l've been watching the sky
change since the sunrise.

1179
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:38,997
Beautiful.

1180
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,334
l went out there,
l took some great shots.

1181
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,841
lt's just so beautiful here.

1182
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:52,803
You grow up here?

1183
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:55,013
No. My dad did, though.

1184
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:00,477
lt's my grandfather's farm.

1185
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:04,523
Was.

1186
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:09,694
Dad was a pilot.
He was 332nd Airborne.

1187
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,404
He was Tuskegee.

1188
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,657
Built that landing strip out there.

1189
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:17,744
Crop dusting. EPA shut him down.

1190
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,704
He traded in the crop duster

1191
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,875
for the old Cessna
sitting out there in the barn.

1192
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:29,172
Flew that damn thing all over the place.

1193
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,219
He died.

1194
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,555
l got a divorce and...

1195
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,977
l've been trying to sell
the place ever since.

1196
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:45,856
What about your mom?

1197
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:47,566
Dead.

1198
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:52,404
You? What about your dad?

1199
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:55,574
Well, l'm pretty sure
he lives in Colorado.

1200
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:56,867
Yeah?

1201
01:14:58,161 --> 01:14:59,661
No relationship?

1202
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,414
lt was my mom that raised me.

1203
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:04,249
She was incredible.

1204
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:09,212
She held it together for so long,
l couldn't even tell how sick she was.

1205
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:14,050
We spent those last
seven months together

1206
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:16,052
like we were teenagers.

1207
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:21,266
We'd trade stories
about boys and whatever.

1208
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:26,897
She loved me.

1209
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:45,790
My name's Trevor.

1210
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,168
You saved my mom.

1211
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,724
lt's great to see you, Whip.

1212
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:04,976
lt's good to see you, too, Margaret.

1213
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:12,192
The service was so nice.

1214
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,986
l mean, all these people
who wanted to say goodbye.

1215
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:20,033
Trina looked so beautiful in there.
Didn't you think so?

1216
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:24,371
l mean, like she was just
going to wake up and smile.

1217
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:27,707
l didn't go in. l... l just couldn't.

1218
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:34,381
Trevor, find Daddy, baby.
He's over there by Mr. Benton.

1219
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:44,015
You really should come
to the counseling group.

1220
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,226
The union has great people
for us to talk to.

1221
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:48,520
l can't. Really. l...

1222
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:50,814
l will.

1223
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,528
Well...

1224
01:16:57,905 --> 01:16:59,864
-You take care, okay, Whip?
-Okay.

1225
01:17:00,408 --> 01:17:02,075
Listen, Margaret.

1226
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:07,247
You know l'm in the middle of this

1227
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:11,334
investigation. The NTSB
is investigating the crash.

1228
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:13,169
Yeah. l'm gonna talk to them next week.

1229
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:16,381
Yeah. Well, l'm... l'm a little nervous

1230
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:21,678
because l was out the night
before the crash, at dinner.

1231
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:22,971
Yeah. With Trina.

1232
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,140
Right. And l had two glasses of wine,

1233
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,726
and they're probably going to ask you

1234
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,644
about my condition that morning,

1235
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:32,814
or whether you thought
l had anything to drink.

1236
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:37,736
What?

1237
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,033
l've known you 1 1 years, Whip.

1238
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:44,200
Right.

1239
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,494
You want to tell me that
you and Trina went to dinner

1240
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,621
-and you had two glasses of wine?
-No.

1241
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:50,915
Sounds like a nice restaurant.
Now, which one was it?

1242
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,960
You have to say that it was
an ordinary day, Margaret.

1243
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:55,170
l mean, it was an ordinary day.

1244
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:57,714
You know me. l was in shape to fly.

1245
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:03,762
You have a problem with saying that?

1246
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:07,640
lt's a lie, Whip.

1247
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:11,353
lt's a lie. Trina told me
you two hadn't been to sleep.

1248
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:16,524
Well, my lack of sleep had nothing to do
with that plane falling apart, Margaret.

1249
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,068
l'm just trying to get this thing straight.

1250
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:21,029
Now you think any other pilot could have
landed that plane and saved more lives?

1251
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,364
l didn't say that, Whip.
l can't imagine another...

1252
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:23,448
All right, then.

1253
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,242
Well, imagine your son,
Trevor, in this church,

1254
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:27,535
looking at you in that box.

1255
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,621
Or my son visiting me in prison. And...

1256
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,916
-Please, Whip, enough. Enough, Whip.
-And for the next 40 years...

1257
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,460
Don't you think we've all had enough?

1258
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,928
l need this, Margaret.

1259
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,145
What do you want me to say?

1260
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,357
l just...

1261
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:01,236
lt was an ordinary day.

1262
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:07,158
The storm, after we took off,

1263
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:09,160
was very severe.

1264
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:13,498
But as far as
the flight crew was concerned,

1265
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:17,127
it was a perfectly ordinary day.

1266
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:40,191
-Hey.
-Hi.

1267
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,279
You okay?

1268
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,864
Yeah, yeah.

1269
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:48,366
So?

1270
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:50,827
Well, l got through my first day.
They didn't fire me.

1271
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:52,162
-So...
-Good. Good.

1272
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,832
And they need someone to work
the night shift and they asked me.

1273
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:57,542
lt's time and a half, so...

1274
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:01,296
l got a vest.

1275
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:03,590
-And a little name tag.
-Nice.

1276
01:20:03,674 --> 01:20:04,674
l got you something.

1277
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:05,925
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1278
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:11,723
lt's a P-51 Mustang.

1279
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:12,891
l know it's a P-51 ...

1280
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:14,058
Your daddy fly one of those?

1281
01:20:14,185 --> 01:20:15,351
Yes, he did.

1282
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:18,021
lt's cause for celebration.

1283
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:21,691
Oh, well, l promised Sheila that
l'd go to this AA meeting now.

1284
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:24,194
She's my sponsor,
the one that's been helping me.

1285
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:25,695
Can we celebrate tomorrow night?

1286
01:20:26,197 --> 01:20:27,238
Yeah.

1287
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,032
Yeah, sure, come on.

1288
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,079
You know, you could come with me.

1289
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,789
To the meeting.

1290
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:39,709
lt's an open meeting,
meaning that anyone can come.

1291
01:20:40,211 --> 01:20:41,711
Even you.

1292
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:45,673
So the cops got a flashIight
on me behind the dumpster.

1293
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:47,300
I'm wearing nothing
but my girlfriend's panties,

1294
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:50,053
I got vomit aII down
the front of my chest.

1295
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:53,640
And I say to them,
"I might have had two beers."

1296
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:03,900
So that's how
I got the nickname "Two Beer Barry."

1297
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:09,030
I'm getting the stink eye
from Ed over here.

1298
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:11,074
Have I gone off format?

1299
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:14,244
My name is Barry and I am an aIcohoIic.

1300
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:15,620
Hi, Barry.

1301
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,748
Are there any other aIcohoIics present?

1302
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:25,588
I aIways Iove a meeting where we

1303
01:21:25,673 --> 01:21:27,131
aII have to identify at the top,

1304
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:30,969
because it forces me
to be honest about who I reaIIy am.

1305
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:34,973
And I never toId the truth
out there, obviousIy.

1306
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:37,100
I Iied about everything.

1307
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:40,687
I was taught in these rooms
that I wouId never get sober

1308
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:43,648
if I kept Iying,
but that's what I was best at.

1309
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:48,069
If I knew anything
in this world it was how to Iie,

1310
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,113
especiaIIy about my drinking.

1311
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:54,826
But, whatever. I wouId Iie
about the name of my dog,

1312
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:58,621
I'd Iie about the coIor of my own hair
right to your face.

1313
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:01,791
And my whoIe Iife just became

1314
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:05,169
a series of Iies strung together by me,

1315
01:22:05,296 --> 01:22:06,921
-one after the other.
-l'm going to go, okay?

1316
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:08,423
-Sure.
-You got a ride home?

1317
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:11,342
Yeah. Sheila, she can give
me a ride. This is Sheila.

1318
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,303
-How you doing?
-l'm Sheila.

1319
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:16,306
...that my Iies wouId kiII me.

1320
01:22:16,974 --> 01:22:18,224
Left to their own devices,

1321
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:21,477
my Iies wouId waIk me out that door.

1322
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:31,154
Is it safe to say that Captain Whitaker
remains a bit of a mystery?

1323
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,364
Those are your words, sir, not mine.

1324
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:34,824
I've been speaking to some peopIe

1325
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,993
who are very cIose
to the NTSB investigation.

1326
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,704
They are confident they wiII
soon be abIe to determine

1327
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:42,040
exactIy what brought this pIane down.

1328
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:43,708
I'm sure they wiII, sir.

1329
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:47,211
WeII, Ken and Vicky Evans,
thank you both very much.

1330
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,505
Thank you, sir. And God bIess you.

1331
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,520
How you feeling, Ken?

1332
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:08,358
Happy to be alive.

1333
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,735
Blessed to be alive.

1334
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:15,740
l'm Captain Whitaker. l was flying with...

1335
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:17,200
l know who you are.

1336
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:21,371
Excuse me. Could you give us
some privacy, please?

1337
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:23,289
Thank you.

1338
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:36,552
So...

1339
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,389
How long have you been out of...

1340
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:41,391
-Out of a coma?
-Yeah.

1341
01:23:42,393 --> 01:23:43,726
Two days.

1342
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:47,271
Good.

1343
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:52,235
Well, look, l don't want
to disrupt your whole day.

1344
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:57,740
And God knows you've been
swamped by interviews and...

1345
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:02,245
You were brilliant on CNN, by the way.

1346
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:07,083
Both my legs are crushed.
My pelvis is snapped.

1347
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,627
l'll probably never walk again,

1348
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,255
at least not without a walker or braces.

1349
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:15,133
l'll certainly never fly again.

1350
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:18,261
l'm very sorry, Ken.

1351
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:22,265
That plane was doomed
the moment you sat in that cockpit.

1352
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,268
You reeked like gin or something.

1353
01:24:26,437 --> 01:24:29,439
l called Vicky
from the plane before we took off.

1354
01:24:30,607 --> 01:24:32,442
That's when the rain kicked up.

1355
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:38,614
Well, l don't know
how much you remember,

1356
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:40,616
but that plane,

1357
01:24:41,452 --> 01:24:43,119
it started falling apart, Ken.

1358
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:45,913
l remember everything until we crashed.

1359
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:47,623
l know what went on.

1360
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:51,794
What are we trying to say, Ken?

1361
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,629
What are we talking about?

1362
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:55,673
l don't know, Captain Whitaker.

1363
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:56,966
What are we talking about?

1364
01:24:57,176 --> 01:25:00,136
l'm just trying to get a sense from you

1365
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:05,475
about what you thought
caused the crash.

1366
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:10,313
Was it the fact that you got on the plane
still drunk from the night before?

1367
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:16,986
The NTSB is coming back tomorrow
to finish taking a deposition from me.

1368
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:19,989
About the events on that flight.

1369
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:24,327
Do you think you'd be alive
if l wasn't flying that plane?

1370
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:26,829
No.

1371
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:28,998
We'd all be dead.

1372
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:33,211
But are you going to argue with me
that your physical state was tip-top?

1373
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:40,510
Wait.

1374
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:42,512
Sit.

1375
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:44,514
Please.

1376
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:53,397
l never shared my opinion
about your physical state

1377
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:55,024
the morning of the flight.

1378
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,027
l never said a word.

1379
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:00,071
Okay.

1380
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:02,532
That crash was preordained.

1381
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:08,037
l prayed on it, Captain.
Vicky and l both prayed on it.

1382
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:10,289
There is only one judge, sir.

1383
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:11,791
Praise Jesus.

1384
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:14,210
And he's got a higher plan for you.

1385
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:19,549
This event,
although it's tragic in its loss of life,

1386
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:24,053
it's also a celebration of life.

1387
01:26:24,555 --> 01:26:27,849
Nothing happens in
the Kingdom of the Lord by mistake, sir.

1388
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:29,100
Praise Jesus.

1389
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,393
Captain.

1390
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,479
Will you pray with us?

1391
01:26:45,409 --> 01:26:49,078
Jesus, our savior, we thank you
for blessing Captain Whitaker.

1392
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:52,248
For guiding his hand
on that fateful morning.

1393
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:55,793
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

1394
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:58,004
-Thanks for the ride.
-Okay.

1395
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:09,599
Hi.

1396
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,018
Hey, hey.

1397
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:16,981
How you doing?

1398
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,446
Oh, hey. Look.

1399
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:25,781
Great, right?

1400
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:27,158
lt's kind of beautiful.

1401
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:28,701
lt is beautiful, isn't it? Like you.

1402
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:29,785
Does it work?

1403
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:31,412
Yes, it works.

1404
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,205
l learned how to fly on this baby.

1405
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:37,293
Me and my friend Harling,
we flew it to Jamaica.

1406
01:27:37,628 --> 01:27:38,836
Jamaica? ln this?

1407
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,129
Yeah. ln this.

1408
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:44,592
We went on an overnight fishing trip
about two hours south of here.

1409
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:47,345
Next thing you know... Bethel, Jamaica.

1410
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:49,430
You're insane.

1411
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:50,514
Yes, l am.

1412
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:52,683
lt was beautiful. lt was like a postcard,

1413
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:56,854
you know, like one of those
picture postcards.

1414
01:27:56,939 --> 01:28:00,650
White sand, beautiful, sky-blue seas.

1415
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:03,986
lt was the most
beautiful thing l ever saw.

1416
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:07,156
Was the water warm?

1417
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:09,492
Yes, it was very warm.

1418
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,494
That's my kind of place.

1419
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:14,038
Let's go.

1420
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:17,208
Sure. Why not?

1421
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:19,168
Yeah. Let's go tomorrow.

1422
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,253
-Oh, you're serious.
-l'm dead serious.

1423
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:22,380
We'll go in the morning.

1424
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:23,923
You know, we'll just get out of here.

1425
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:25,549
-Start over.
-Whip, we can't. No.

1426
01:28:25,676 --> 01:28:28,636
Yes, we can. lt'll be beautiful.

1427
01:28:29,096 --> 01:28:30,304
Bright sand beaches...

1428
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:31,889
-l'm worried about you.
-lt's...

1429
01:28:32,015 --> 01:28:33,849
Don't worry about me.
l'm fine. Thank you.

1430
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:36,477
-You're not. You're really not.
-Yes, l am. Yes, l am.

1431
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:38,354
You need help.

1432
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:41,190
You need rehab, Whip.

1433
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:45,695
You think l need rehab?
So, you go to two AA meetings

1434
01:28:45,779 --> 01:28:48,114
and l need rehab? Okay.

1435
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:49,865
Hey, look, who are you, Jesus Christ?

1436
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,534
Don't worry about me, okay?

1437
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,537
You just worry about yourself.
Don't worry about me.

1438
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:55,788
We're the same, you and me.

1439
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:56,914
-No, we're not the same.
-Yeah, we are.

1440
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,834
We are not the same.
l don't suck dick to get high, okay?

1441
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:01,335
And don't give me that
your mother died...

1442
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:02,461
-l never!
-...and your father...

1443
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:03,629
l never in my life...

1444
01:29:03,714 --> 01:29:05,798
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

1445
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,675
-That why you shot dope?
-That's not fair.

1446
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:09,093
That's why you get high?

1447
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:11,012
There's a whole lot of people
out there whose mothers die

1448
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:12,138
and they don't fucking drink.

1449
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:13,639
-You're sick, Whip.
-Yeah, well,

1450
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:15,558
l embrace it. Shit!

1451
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:17,560
l choose to drink!

1452
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:18,811
-You do?
-Yes, l do.

1453
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:21,188
You choose it? Well, l don't see
a whole lot of choice going on here!

1454
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:23,983
l choose to drink! And l blame myself!

1455
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:26,819
l'm happy to! And you know why?

1456
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:29,113
Because l choose to drink!

1457
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:33,242
l got an ex-wife and a son l never talk to!

1458
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:36,912
And you know why?
Because l choose to drink!

1459
01:29:37,247 --> 01:29:38,831
No. l got to go.

1460
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:40,082
Nicole.

1461
01:29:57,434 --> 01:29:59,101
Hey, listen.

1462
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:04,940
All right, look.

1463
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:11,113
l was loaded when the plane crashed.

1464
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:14,408
With this investigation,
l don't know what's going to happen.

1465
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:17,119
l could go to jail for the rest of my life.

1466
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:20,289
l got to get out of here.

1467
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:24,293
And l want you to come with me.

1468
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,129
Whip.

1469
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:34,970
l'm afraid that l'm gonna use again.
Do you understand?

1470
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:36,180
Then come with me.

1471
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,809
Just come with me. l need help, l do.

1472
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:42,937
-l'd like it if you got help.
-l'll get help.

1473
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:45,606
We'll go straight to Jamaica,
we'll go right to the local hospital.

1474
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,024
l'll do it.

1475
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:50,319
For you. Any... Anything you want.

1476
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:55,825
l don't want to use again.

1477
01:30:56,993 --> 01:31:00,162
l can't. l won't make it back, Whip.

1478
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:03,833
l won't force you to stay.

1479
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:07,586
lf you don't like it,
if l don't sober up, then you leave.

1480
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:09,672
l promise you, you can leave.

1481
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:15,678
We can leave before noon.

1482
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:17,555
l'm a great pilot.

1483
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:20,850
So many beautiful things to see.

1484
01:31:22,352 --> 01:31:24,728
l just want you to come with me.

1485
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:26,373
Everything okay, sweetie?

1486
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:27,917
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1487
01:32:36,426 --> 01:32:37,760
Nicole.

1488
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:40,596
Nicole?

1489
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:12,628
You've reached
the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company.

1490
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:15,172
PIease Ieave a message
and it wiII be returned.

1491
01:33:16,341 --> 01:33:18,008
Hey, Whip, if you're there, pick up.

1492
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:19,677
It's Charlie. I got some good news.

1493
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:42,157
Hello?

1494
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:56,338
Oh! There's our man. Hey!

1495
01:33:58,174 --> 01:33:59,675
Captain Whitaker.

1496
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:02,845
Let me be the first to say,
"Congratulations."

1497
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:04,847
lt's a good day. We've won.

1498
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,891
Yeah, this is what we call,
in my profession, a "walk over."

1499
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:09,977
Yeah, they scheduled a hearing,
it's 1 0 days away.

1500
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:11,603
They can be tough,
but you just gotta be sharp.

1501
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:12,771
Stay focused.

1502
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:14,273
Answer the questions correctly.

1503
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:15,733
That's right, but we're good.

1504
01:34:16,026 --> 01:34:17,901
All right,
l've successfully had an "Act of God"

1505
01:34:18,028 --> 01:34:20,362
added to the NTSB's
list of probable causes.

1506
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:22,281
We've shifted suspicion away from you.

1507
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:24,408
lt's no longer a question
of your condition,

1508
01:34:24,534 --> 01:34:26,201
but the condition of the plane.

1509
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:28,203
Fantastic. That's what l've been
trying to tell everybody.

1510
01:34:28,288 --> 01:34:30,456
This is a broken plane.

1511
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:31,582
That's right.

1512
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:35,252
What about my toxicology report?

1513
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:36,712
Oh, l killed that.

1514
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:40,966
There is no physical proof
that you were intoxicated on that plane,

1515
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:42,384
and no eyewitnesses.

1516
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:45,429
So why are we here? We're good.

1517
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:48,557
Because there is a small problem.

1518
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:52,102
Because of turbulence,
there was no drink service on the flight,

1519
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:56,523
but they did find two empty
vodka bottles in the galley trash.

1520
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:58,108
Yeah...

1521
01:34:58,568 --> 01:35:00,652
And there's no physical
evidence on the bottles.

1522
01:35:00,779 --> 01:35:03,197
No DNA, no fingerprints
to link them to anyone,

1523
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:05,324
but they were uncapped and empty.

1524
01:35:05,575 --> 01:35:07,326
And the only people
who would have had access

1525
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:10,621
to those bottles would be the flight crew.

1526
01:35:10,747 --> 01:35:14,249
Now, Margaret,
Evans and Camelia Satou,

1527
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:18,962
they all had clean tox reports,
so that only leaves you and...

1528
01:35:19,089 --> 01:35:21,632
-Trina Marquez.
-Right, Trina Marquez.

1529
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:25,094
Okay.

1530
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:29,264
Okay, l see where we're going here.

1531
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:32,935
That's funny, though, you know,
they only found two bottles.

1532
01:35:33,269 --> 01:35:35,437
-Why is that?
-l drank three.

1533
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,232
One's missing.

1534
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:42,945
You know, when l first met you,

1535
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:46,281
l couldn't believe what a drunk,
arrogant scumbag you were.

1536
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:47,366
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

1537
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:48,450
Oh, thank you, Hugh.

1538
01:35:48,535 --> 01:35:50,077
But l did the research,
Captain Whitaker.

1539
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:52,037
l heard the expert analysis,

1540
01:35:52,163 --> 01:35:54,665
and l got to tell you,
l'm in awe of what you did.

1541
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:57,960
The FAA and the NTSB took 1 0 pilots,

1542
01:35:58,169 --> 01:35:59,503
placed them in simulators,

1543
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:03,006
re-created the events that led
to this plane falling out of the sky.

1544
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:06,510
Do you know how many of them
were able to safely land the planes?

1545
01:36:06,636 --> 01:36:07,636
Not one.

1546
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:11,598
Every pilot crashed the aircraft,
killed everybody on board.

1547
01:36:11,683 --> 01:36:13,517
You were the only one who could do it.

1548
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:14,685
Great.

1549
01:36:15,979 --> 01:36:17,020
l'm going home.

1550
01:36:17,147 --> 01:36:18,522
-Hey, wait, Whip. You can't...
-Captain Whitaker,

1551
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:19,815
l'm telling you right now,
you walk away...

1552
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:21,233
-Listen, man.
-...you're going to prison.

1553
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:22,526
l'm trying to save your fucking life.

1554
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:24,319
What fucking life?

1555
01:36:24,654 --> 01:36:26,989
Don't kill yourself on my account, Hugh.

1556
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,199
Captain Whitaker, this NTSB hearing

1557
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:31,535
is a federal agency hearing.
Do you understand that?

1558
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:33,036
Yes, l understand that.

1559
01:36:33,163 --> 01:36:35,664
Okay. Well, we can't play
around with these people.

1560
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:40,085
Now, we walk in there
like this, with this, we're done.

1561
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:42,838
Everything we've done
goes right out the window.

1562
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:45,257
l have no more moves, all right?

1563
01:36:45,383 --> 01:36:47,342
lt's all on you right now.

1564
01:36:51,181 --> 01:36:53,390
Okay. Charlie,
just get him to the church on time.

1565
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:55,976
Yeah, get him to the church on time!

1566
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:58,562
Yeah, Charlie,
just keep him nice and sober,

1567
01:36:58,688 --> 01:37:01,523
so he can save your fucking union!

1568
01:37:01,608 --> 01:37:02,608
Listen, Whip...

1569
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:05,068
And that fat fuck's airline!
Fuck you, Charlie! Fuck you!

1570
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:10,926
lt's him. Yeah, it's him, all right.

1571
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,017
How you doing?

1572
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:21,770
What are you doing here?

1573
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:25,566
lt's good to see you, too, Deana.
May l come in?

1574
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:31,446
l just thought l'd come by
and see how you and Will are doing.

1575
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:33,532
Will! Knuckles!

1576
01:38:34,367 --> 01:38:38,120
We hadn't talked in a while,
and this whole thing happened.

1577
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:41,290
l just thought l'd come by
and we could talk.

1578
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:43,792
You know that l prefer that you call us.

1579
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:45,294
-Right, right.
-Yeah.

1580
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:47,212
Yeah, call you. But l mean,

1581
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,465
it's not like anybody
around here calls me,

1582
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:53,719
in the last three years,
other than to ask for some money.

1583
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:56,388
Have you been drinking?

1584
01:38:56,723 --> 01:38:58,557
Well, that didn't take long, did it?

1585
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:02,060
Seventeen seconds. Yeah.
Exactly 1 7 seconds.

1586
01:39:02,145 --> 01:39:04,229
-Ladies and gentlemen...
-l'm gonna ask you just to leave.

1587
01:39:04,314 --> 01:39:06,106
lt took exactly 1 7 seconds
for my ex-wife,

1588
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:07,983
Deana Coleman,
to ask me if l was drinking.

1589
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:09,943
-Just leave, Will.
-What, is that a world record?

1590
01:39:10,028 --> 01:39:12,237
Leave the house that l paid for?
That's what you want me to do?

1591
01:39:12,322 --> 01:39:13,447
l'm calling the police.

1592
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:14,573
Call the police.

1593
01:39:14,824 --> 01:39:15,907
l'm telling you to leave.

1594
01:39:15,992 --> 01:39:17,993
Will Whitaker, Junior!
How you doing, son?

1595
01:39:18,077 --> 01:39:20,912
Man of the house.
Thanks for calling me back.

1596
01:39:20,997 --> 01:39:23,665
l'm telling you to leave.

1597
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:27,419
Are you?
You're the man of the house now?

1598
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:29,671
You upset my mother. You gotta go.

1599
01:39:29,756 --> 01:39:31,757
Well, l'm your father, tough guy.

1600
01:39:31,841 --> 01:39:33,258
You're a drunk.

1601
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:34,635
Get off!

1602
01:39:34,761 --> 01:39:36,928
l'm a drunk. You don't know
who the fuck l am.

1603
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:39,264
l sure don't! Why don't you tell me?

1604
01:39:39,349 --> 01:39:40,307
What?

1605
01:39:40,391 --> 01:39:42,267
Who the fuck are you? Who are you?

1606
01:39:42,352 --> 01:39:43,518
Get the fuck out!

1607
01:39:45,772 --> 01:39:46,938
Get the fuck out, man!

1608
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:49,191
Whip, stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1609
01:39:49,275 --> 01:39:50,359
l love you, son.

1610
01:39:50,443 --> 01:39:51,610
Get the fuck out!

1611
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:53,153
Stop it! That's enough!

1612
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:54,279
Get out!

1613
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:56,948
l know where l'm not wanted.

1614
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:00,369
Captain Whitaker,
a lot of people are working

1615
01:40:00,453 --> 01:40:02,287
to keep you out of the media.
Are you hiding something?

1616
01:40:02,372 --> 01:40:04,373
Just give my family some room, please.

1617
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:06,708
This is not the appropriate time.

1618
01:40:06,793 --> 01:40:08,293
At the appropriate time,

1619
01:40:08,378 --> 01:40:12,297
l will tell my story, and now is

1620
01:40:12,632 --> 01:40:14,132
a time for grieving

1621
01:40:14,467 --> 01:40:18,970
and taking care of the injured.
Thank you.

1622
01:40:19,305 --> 01:40:20,972
Questions remain about the flight,

1623
01:40:21,057 --> 01:40:22,641
but they won't be answered today

1624
01:40:22,892 --> 01:40:24,393
as Captain Whitaker poIiteIy asked

1625
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:26,478
that we give his famiIy some peace.

1626
01:40:26,729 --> 01:40:30,399
A reasonabIe request
from a quiet, heroic man who has...

1627
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,109
Hey, Charlie.

1628
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:37,155
Listen, l just couldn't find a safe place.

1629
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:40,325
Amanda was kind enough
to let me in. Thank you.

1630
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:42,160
Are you sure l can't get you something?

1631
01:40:42,245 --> 01:40:43,745
-No, l'm fine.
-No, we're good.

1632
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:46,164
But thank you. Thank you very much.

1633
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,001
What the hell is wrong with you?

1634
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:51,586
Really.

1635
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:53,588
Hugh just called me.

1636
01:40:53,673 --> 01:40:56,675
Apparently, you went to
your ex-wife's house drunk as a skunk,

1637
01:40:56,759 --> 01:40:59,678
the news crews showed up
and then the police escort you out.

1638
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:01,596
lt's okay, though.
l been watching. lt's okay.

1639
01:41:01,681 --> 01:41:02,681
Oh, yeah, no,

1640
01:41:02,765 --> 01:41:04,099
Hugh checked
all the media outlets that covered it.

1641
01:41:04,183 --> 01:41:06,268
You come off fine.
So l guess we're good.

1642
01:41:06,352 --> 01:41:08,103
Okay, good. Okay,
here's the deal, though...

1643
01:41:08,354 --> 01:41:10,856
No, Whip, Whip. There's no deals.
All right, look at you.

1644
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:13,442
l got no idea what you're
gonna do or say, ever.

1645
01:41:13,526 --> 01:41:14,568
You're all over the place.

1646
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:15,986
l was the one guy in your court.

1647
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:17,279
The one guy!

1648
01:41:17,363 --> 01:41:20,031
l was your defender
and your apologist, but no more.

1649
01:41:20,116 --> 01:41:21,616
Charlie, l can do this.

1650
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:24,119
You're about to
be questioned by a federal agency

1651
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:26,371
about piloting an airliner drunk.

1652
01:41:26,456 --> 01:41:27,581
An airliner that crashed!

1653
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:29,666
And you continue to drink!
And stumble around!

1654
01:41:29,751 --> 01:41:31,168
What kind of crazy
do you have to be to do that?

1655
01:41:31,252 --> 01:41:32,294
l'm afraid of you.

1656
01:41:32,378 --> 01:41:33,628
Okay, all right.
Then let me stay with you.

1657
01:41:33,713 --> 01:41:34,796
Let me stay with you.

1658
01:41:34,881 --> 01:41:36,047
They're staking out
all my houses anyway.

1659
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:39,885
l'll stay with you until, until...

1660
01:41:40,219 --> 01:41:43,388
Until the hearing.
l won't leave the house.

1661
01:41:46,225 --> 01:41:47,392
l won't.

1662
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:50,937
You cannot drink in my house.

1663
01:41:51,022 --> 01:41:52,063
l won't. l won't. l won't.

1664
01:41:52,148 --> 01:41:53,815
You can't have a drink.

1665
01:41:54,901 --> 01:41:56,234
l won't.

1666
01:42:02,742 --> 01:42:04,910
-Officer Edmonds.
-Yes, sir.

1667
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:07,662
Whip, this is Officer Edmonds.
He'll be staying here tonight.

1668
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:09,831
Any problems, he'll handle it.

1669
01:42:12,752 --> 01:42:15,003
-Captain Whitaker.
-Hugh.

1670
01:42:15,755 --> 01:42:18,089
You look great. l mean that.

1671
01:42:18,424 --> 01:42:20,091
Thank you.
Thank you very much. l feel good.

1672
01:42:20,176 --> 01:42:22,761
Yeah. Charlie tells me
you haven't had a drink in eight days.

1673
01:42:22,845 --> 01:42:26,348
Nine days, two hours, 26 minutes.
But who's counting?

1674
01:42:26,432 --> 01:42:28,266
Okay. Right here.

1675
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:33,396
So, yeah, we wanted to make this
as easy as possible on you.

1676
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:34,689
l hope this is okay.

1677
01:42:34,774 --> 01:42:36,817
You can just relax, get some rest.

1678
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:39,027
Order up a steak, get a movie.

1679
01:42:39,445 --> 01:42:44,699
l made a copy of the entire investigation
and my file on you.

1680
01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:47,285
l was trying to anticipate what kinds of

1681
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:49,287
questions they might ask you
under oath,

1682
01:42:49,539 --> 01:42:51,998
and l wrote some
non-damaging responses.

1683
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:54,042
So, it's all in there.

1684
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:58,463
You know, with photos, interviews,
there's some testimony in there.

1685
01:42:58,798 --> 01:43:00,423
l called Ellen Block, told her you're here.

1686
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:01,800
You're all tucked in.

1687
01:43:02,635 --> 01:43:04,469
She got the knife out for me?

1688
01:43:05,972 --> 01:43:09,641
Well, look, she's not happy
that l killed the tox report,

1689
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:11,184
but this isn't a trial,

1690
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:13,144
so she's very limited
in the kinds of questions

1691
01:43:13,354 --> 01:43:14,354
she can ask you.

1692
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,814
You know? You're gonna be fine.

1693
01:43:15,898 --> 01:43:19,776
Yeah, the hearing's
at 1 0:00, so just downstairs,

1694
01:43:19,861 --> 01:43:23,071
so we're figuring we meet here at 9:00
for breakfast in the room

1695
01:43:23,155 --> 01:43:25,991
-and take it from there.
-Take it from there.

1696
01:43:26,075 --> 01:43:27,075
Yeah.

1697
01:43:27,577 --> 01:43:29,411
All right, Captain Whitaker,
see you in the morning.

1698
01:43:29,495 --> 01:43:32,414
Thank you. And thank you
for letting me stay in your house.

1699
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:34,165
You have a beautiful home,
beautiful family.

1700
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:35,208
You did great.

1701
01:43:35,293 --> 01:43:36,751
l needed it. l needed it.

1702
01:43:36,836 --> 01:43:39,087
-That's all right. Happy to do it.
-Okay. Yep.

1703
01:43:40,506 --> 01:43:42,716
-All right. See you in the morning.
-Okay, yes.

1704
01:43:51,517 --> 01:43:52,851
Just like flying.

1705
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:15,326
Hello?

1706
01:46:36,682 --> 01:46:37,849
Hello.

1707
01:48:59,074 --> 01:49:00,116
How's our man?

1708
01:49:00,201 --> 01:49:01,284
Not a peep.

1709
01:49:09,335 --> 01:49:10,627
Maybe he overslept.

1710
01:49:10,711 --> 01:49:11,961
Yeah.

1711
01:49:12,671 --> 01:49:15,006
You didn't let
any girls in there last night, did you?

1712
01:49:15,341 --> 01:49:17,425
No, sir, not a soul.

1713
01:49:17,509 --> 01:49:20,428
No one came in or out
besides room service.

1714
01:49:22,056 --> 01:49:23,056
Okay.

1715
01:49:25,684 --> 01:49:27,018
You have a key?

1716
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:28,937
Hey, Whip.

1717
01:49:30,189 --> 01:49:32,190
Hey, buddy! Whip!

1718
01:49:32,524 --> 01:49:34,192
Holy shit.

1719
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:36,945
-What the hell?
-No kidding.

1720
01:49:37,238 --> 01:49:39,113
-What the hell?
-Where the fuck is he?

1721
01:49:39,198 --> 01:49:40,865
-Oh, Jesus.
-Where is he?

1722
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:42,700
-Where is he? Where is he?
-l don't know.

1723
01:49:42,868 --> 01:49:44,619
Did he fucking walk away?
Son of a bitch.

1724
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:46,871
Hugh. Hugh. Whip!

1725
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,040
Damn it!

1726
01:49:49,291 --> 01:49:50,959
-Oh, no. ls he dead?
-l don't know.

1727
01:49:51,210 --> 01:49:52,543
-ls he dead?
-l don't know.

1728
01:49:52,795 --> 01:49:53,962
Yeah, l'm dead!

1729
01:49:54,046 --> 01:49:55,964
You want me to get an ambulance?

1730
01:49:56,215 --> 01:49:58,132
-No, no, no. No. No.
-No.

1731
01:49:58,217 --> 01:49:59,467
Who's making all that noise?

1732
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:01,886
Let's just get him to the bed. Come on.

1733
01:50:02,221 --> 01:50:03,554
Come on. That's all right.

1734
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:05,139
That's it, Charlie.

1735
01:50:05,224 --> 01:50:07,225
Okay? That's it.
We're fucked, man. He just fucked us.

1736
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:09,102
Your guy just fucked us, Charlie.

1737
01:50:09,186 --> 01:50:11,396
All right. You just get on the front door
make sure nobody comes in.

1738
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:12,647
Put that on your head.

1739
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:14,983
There you go, man. What time is it?

1740
01:50:15,067 --> 01:50:16,526
We've got 45 minutes, okay?

1741
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:18,236
How much grace you think we've got?

1742
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:19,821
Grace? Ellen Block?

1743
01:50:19,905 --> 01:50:21,489
We're going to get some fucking grace?

1744
01:50:21,573 --> 01:50:24,409
Well, we probably got an hour before
we really gotta get him downstairs.

1745
01:50:24,493 --> 01:50:25,785
Okay. Great.
Well, let's just get a wheelchair

1746
01:50:25,869 --> 01:50:26,995
and wheel his ass into the hearing!

1747
01:50:27,079 --> 01:50:28,371
Call Harling Mays, man.

1748
01:50:28,455 --> 01:50:29,580
Oh, Harling's got a wheelchair?

1749
01:50:29,665 --> 01:50:31,082
He's got cocaine.

1750
01:50:32,084 --> 01:50:33,418
Cocaine?

1751
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:42,593
Hey, brother. Harling Mays.
l'm on the list.

1752
01:50:43,095 --> 01:50:44,262
Whip.

1753
01:50:46,098 --> 01:50:47,849
What's the deal, buddy?

1754
01:50:47,933 --> 01:50:49,934
You look like you're hurtin' for certain.

1755
01:50:50,019 --> 01:50:53,479
-Thanks for...
-Do not touch the merch, motherfucker!

1756
01:50:57,109 --> 01:50:58,943
Take one step back, please.

1757
01:51:01,113 --> 01:51:03,573
Cee Lo, l need you outside
guarding the door, please.

1758
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:05,199
Thank you very much.

1759
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:06,617
Go ahead.

1760
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:08,453
lt's all right. Yeah.

1761
01:51:09,121 --> 01:51:11,581
All right, gentlemen,
l need that table cleared

1762
01:51:11,665 --> 01:51:13,958
and placed in front of Whip
with a chair behind it.

1763
01:51:14,626 --> 01:51:16,294
Now, please!

1764
01:51:18,464 --> 01:51:21,758
l need a glass of water,
l need a credit card,

1765
01:51:21,842 --> 01:51:23,468
l need a hundred dollar bill.

1766
01:51:23,802 --> 01:51:25,303
l got a 20.

1767
01:51:25,554 --> 01:51:26,804
She'll do.

1768
01:51:27,639 --> 01:51:29,807
All right, Whip, banana boat's a-coming.

1769
01:51:30,142 --> 01:51:32,310
And l need a coco puff.

1770
01:51:32,644 --> 01:51:33,811
A what?

1771
01:51:34,646 --> 01:51:38,983
Just take the tiniest little bit of tobacco
out of the top of the cigarette, please.

1772
01:51:39,318 --> 01:51:40,985
Damn. Amateur night.

1773
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:43,821
Banana boat's a-coming.
You're almost home.

1774
01:51:43,906 --> 01:51:46,657
Okay, baby, we're gonna do

1775
01:51:48,494 --> 01:51:50,661
two small whiffs first,

1776
01:51:52,164 --> 01:51:54,165
one on each side.

1777
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:57,585
Just a little primer to get us started.

1778
01:51:57,669 --> 01:51:59,003
Okay.

1779
01:51:59,838 --> 01:52:01,172
Coco puff.

1780
01:52:12,976 --> 01:52:15,103
Attaboy. Attaboy. Head back. Swallow.

1781
01:52:15,187 --> 01:52:16,771
Water! Water now, chief, you.

1782
01:52:29,451 --> 01:52:30,451
All right.

1783
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:32,870
A little coco puff, buddy.

1784
01:52:34,206 --> 01:52:35,289
Who's the banana man?

1785
01:52:35,374 --> 01:52:36,457
You.

1786
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:39,710
There's the banana man.
All right. Now focus up, big dog.

1787
01:52:46,218 --> 01:52:47,343
Here's the train coming to you.

1788
01:52:47,428 --> 01:52:48,428
Yeah.

1789
01:52:49,555 --> 01:52:51,556
Keep it down, big dog.

1790
01:52:52,891 --> 01:52:54,559
Banana boat's coming.

1791
01:52:54,893 --> 01:52:56,310
And the banana boat is here.

1792
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:57,770
All right.

1793
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:03,568
Nothing keeps you down, dog.

1794
01:53:03,902 --> 01:53:06,571
Nothing keeps that big dog down.

1795
01:53:09,408 --> 01:53:10,825
You all are up.

1796
01:53:14,121 --> 01:53:15,163
l don't...

1797
01:53:16,248 --> 01:53:18,374
Shit, l'll take another hit.

1798
01:53:27,426 --> 01:53:30,011
Thank you, brother. Shit, l'm back.

1799
01:53:30,095 --> 01:53:32,013
All right, baby. l love you.

1800
01:53:32,097 --> 01:53:34,265
l love you, too. Shit.

1801
01:53:40,272 --> 01:53:44,192
All right. Which one of you gentlemen
is funding this enterprise?

1802
01:53:45,611 --> 01:53:47,236
lt's 500 bucks.

1803
01:53:47,321 --> 01:53:49,280
l've got like 80 bucks on me.

1804
01:53:50,782 --> 01:53:51,824
How much you got?

1805
01:53:51,909 --> 01:53:53,284
l got it. l got it.

1806
01:53:53,368 --> 01:53:54,368
All right.

1807
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:56,370
-Here, just... You pay him.
-What?

1808
01:53:56,455 --> 01:53:57,538
Pay him.

1809
01:53:57,956 --> 01:53:59,957
Thank you. Okay.

1810
01:54:00,792 --> 01:54:02,627
There's a gram in here.

1811
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:06,297
You take it. You paid for it.
He's going to need it later.

1812
01:54:07,883 --> 01:54:09,884
My work here is finished.

1813
01:54:12,804 --> 01:54:14,972
See y'all on the dark side of the moon.

1814
01:54:43,001 --> 01:54:44,335
Your nose.

1815
01:55:06,024 --> 01:55:07,525
l'll go ahead and tell them we're here.

1816
01:55:07,859 --> 01:55:09,026
You're going to make it.

1817
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:10,820
Remember, if they
ask you anything about your drinking,

1818
01:55:10,904 --> 01:55:12,947
it's totally acceptable
to say, "l don't recall."

1819
01:55:13,031 --> 01:55:16,367
Hey, don't tell me
how to lie about my drinking, okay?

1820
01:55:16,702 --> 01:55:18,077
l know how to lie about my drinking.

1821
01:55:18,161 --> 01:55:19,954
l've been lying about
my drinking my whole life.

1822
01:55:37,723 --> 01:55:39,599
Those are difficult images to watch.

1823
01:55:39,683 --> 01:55:42,810
For the record, l'm Ellen Block,
hearing officer for this hearing.

1824
01:55:42,894 --> 01:55:44,562
Captain Whitaker, good morning.

1825
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:46,814
Morning.

1826
01:55:46,898 --> 01:55:48,858
What that video captures is that

1827
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:51,402
the aircraft
was in a relatively stable glide

1828
01:55:51,486 --> 01:55:53,738
just prior to the moment of impact.

1829
01:55:53,822 --> 01:55:56,032
However, according to
the data we retrieved

1830
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:57,992
from the cockpit data recorders,

1831
01:55:58,243 --> 01:56:02,663
at exactly 9:34,
after flying 27 minutes without incident,

1832
01:56:02,748 --> 01:56:05,583
the transponder recorded
a loss in altitude

1833
01:56:05,667 --> 01:56:09,003
in excess of 4,800 feet per minute

1834
01:56:09,254 --> 01:56:12,757
in what is considered
a "full pitch nose down" attitude.

1835
01:56:13,091 --> 01:56:17,637
Then, at 9:42,
according to the data recorders,

1836
01:56:17,846 --> 01:56:20,931
a decision was made
to invert the aircraft.

1837
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:23,768
The NTSB has created
an animated simulation

1838
01:56:23,852 --> 01:56:26,020
that l would like to play at this point.

1839
01:56:26,688 --> 01:56:27,855
We're going to roII it.

1840
01:56:28,106 --> 01:56:29,357
What do you mean "RoII it"?

1841
01:56:29,441 --> 01:56:30,775
We gotta do something to stop this dive.

1842
01:56:31,026 --> 01:56:32,693
Margaret, what's your son's name?

1843
01:56:32,944 --> 01:56:34,779
-Trevor.
-Say, "I Iove you, Trevor."

1844
01:56:34,863 --> 01:56:35,863
-What?
-BIack box.

1845
01:56:35,947 --> 01:56:36,947
Say, "I Iove you, Trevor."

1846
01:56:37,032 --> 01:56:39,575
I Iove you, Trevor.
You be a good boy. Mommy Ioves you.

1847
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:41,577
Okay, here we go. I've got controI.

1848
01:56:42,454 --> 01:56:45,289
Oh, Lord Jesus!

1849
01:56:45,624 --> 01:56:47,458
-...flaps.
-FIaps!

1850
01:56:47,793 --> 01:56:49,794
-Speed brakes.
-Speed brakes!

1851
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:52,463
Margaret! Power!

1852
01:56:52,798 --> 01:56:54,131
-Gear up.
-Gear up!

1853
01:56:54,466 --> 01:56:56,133
Oh, Lord Jesus, we're inverted!

1854
01:56:56,218 --> 01:56:57,426
We're flying. We're IeveI.

1855
01:56:57,511 --> 01:56:59,053
We can maintain aItitude Iike...

1856
01:56:59,304 --> 01:57:02,473
AtIanta Center... SouthJet... 7.
We are inverted.

1857
01:57:02,557 --> 01:57:04,141
I... We are inverted.

1858
01:57:04,476 --> 01:57:07,937
SouthJet 2... 7, did you say inverted?

1859
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:11,899
That audio is tragic and compelling.

1860
01:57:11,983 --> 01:57:14,318
l chose to play that part
of the cockpit recording

1861
01:57:14,569 --> 01:57:17,738
to highlight a key moment
on board flight 227,

1862
01:57:17,989 --> 01:57:20,491
wherein you say, "We're going to roll it.

1863
01:57:20,826 --> 01:57:22,993
"Here we go. l've got control."

1864
01:57:23,245 --> 01:57:26,789
You made a very conscious decision
to invert the aircraft,

1865
01:57:26,873 --> 01:57:29,667
to roll the plane upside down,
is that correct?

1866
01:57:32,838 --> 01:57:35,673
l'm not sure if it was conscious. But...

1867
01:57:37,175 --> 01:57:39,176
lt was more like instinct.

1868
01:57:40,345 --> 01:57:42,346
What led to that decision?

1869
01:57:46,518 --> 01:57:47,852
l don't recall.

1870
01:57:48,186 --> 01:57:50,312
Let me quote from
an investigative summary.

1871
01:57:50,397 --> 01:57:52,690
"From 9:34 until 9:42,

1872
01:57:52,774 --> 01:57:55,776
"the events on the aircraft are,"
again l quote,

1873
01:57:55,861 --> 01:57:58,028
"bold and remarkable.

1874
01:57:58,363 --> 01:58:01,866
"By inverting the plane,
Captain Whitaker arrested the descent

1875
01:58:02,117 --> 01:58:04,618
"and allowed the aircraft to level off,

1876
01:58:04,870 --> 01:58:08,706
"enabling him to glide the aircraft
away from any populated areas

1877
01:58:08,957 --> 01:58:13,127
"and allowing him to execute
a forced landing in an open field."

1878
01:58:22,554 --> 01:58:25,222
l heard a loud metallic bang.

1879
01:58:25,891 --> 01:58:28,058
We pitched nose down.

1880
01:58:29,728 --> 01:58:31,061
-No control.
-Yes.

1881
01:58:31,396 --> 01:58:34,315
First Officer Evans'
testimony confirms the same.

1882
01:58:37,068 --> 01:58:38,903
l want to show you something.

1883
01:58:43,241 --> 01:58:45,242
Nothing's happening.

1884
01:58:45,911 --> 01:58:47,119
This remote isn't working.

1885
01:58:47,204 --> 01:58:49,747
Apologies. l can do this manually.

1886
01:59:00,926 --> 01:59:03,594
This is the jackscrew
on the tail assembly

1887
01:59:03,678 --> 01:59:06,764
that articulates the horizontal stabilizer,

1888
01:59:06,932 --> 01:59:08,432
also known as the elevator.

1889
01:59:08,517 --> 01:59:09,725
As you can see,

1890
01:59:10,018 --> 01:59:13,145
the threads on this screw
are almost entirely gone.

1891
01:59:13,605 --> 01:59:16,857
This part was suggested as
a maintenance replacement

1892
01:59:17,192 --> 01:59:20,903
in January of 201 1 .
lt was never replaced.

1893
01:59:21,446 --> 01:59:24,365
lt had an additional
1 ,200 hours of flight on it.

1894
01:59:24,449 --> 01:59:25,616
lt finally failed.

1895
01:59:25,742 --> 01:59:28,244
Our investigators have concluded

1896
01:59:28,703 --> 01:59:30,538
that the jackscrew snapped

1897
01:59:30,789 --> 01:59:34,458
and the elevator was frozen
in a fixed position,

1898
01:59:34,793 --> 01:59:37,336
locking the elevator in a down position,

1899
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:39,797
which forced the plane into a dive.

1900
01:59:40,131 --> 01:59:43,884
The loss of the elevator was,
and l quote our report,

1901
01:59:43,969 --> 01:59:47,471
"A catastrophic event
from which recovery was improbable

1902
01:59:47,556 --> 01:59:49,765
"and stable flight impossible."

1903
01:59:53,645 --> 01:59:54,979
Mr. Whitaker,

1904
01:59:55,814 --> 01:59:57,773
l want to talk about the days leading

1905
01:59:57,858 --> 02:00:00,484
and the hours leading
up to the accident.

1906
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:01,694
But before l do,

1907
02:00:01,778 --> 02:00:03,529
l want to remind you
that you are under oath

1908
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:05,406
and that any testimony
you give here today

1909
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:06,907
will be considered admissible

1910
02:00:07,033 --> 02:00:09,785
in any subsequent hearings
or criminal proceedings.

1911
02:00:09,995 --> 02:00:11,996
Do you understand what that means?

1912
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:17,543
Captain Whitaker, for the record,
l need you to verbalize your answer.

1913
02:00:18,795 --> 02:00:21,130
l'm sorry. Yes, l understand.

1914
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:23,757
On the three days
leading up to the accident,

1915
02:00:23,842 --> 02:00:25,426
Tuesday, October 1 1th,

1916
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:29,013
Wednesday, October 1 2th
or Thursday, October 1 3th,

1917
02:00:29,097 --> 02:00:33,183
did you consume any alcohol
or other intoxicating elements?

1918
02:00:34,144 --> 02:00:35,477
No, l did not.

1919
02:00:35,937 --> 02:00:37,646
On the morning of the accident,

1920
02:00:37,898 --> 02:00:39,940
Friday, October 14th,

1921
02:00:40,025 --> 02:00:45,195
did you consume any alcohol
or ingest any chemicals or drugs

1922
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:48,949
that may have impaired
your ability to perform yourjob?

1923
02:00:49,367 --> 02:00:51,035
No, l did not.

1924
02:00:51,912 --> 02:00:55,539
Mr. Whitaker, do you now
or have you ever had

1925
02:00:55,624 --> 02:00:57,833
a problem with alcohol dependency,

1926
02:00:57,918 --> 02:01:00,377
alcoholism or drug addiction?

1927
02:01:00,712 --> 02:01:01,712
No.

1928
02:01:04,049 --> 02:01:06,216
Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about done.

1929
02:01:13,308 --> 02:01:17,061
Due to the severe turbulence
in the early part of the flight,

1930
02:01:17,145 --> 02:01:19,480
you asked the flight crew to suspend

1931
02:01:19,564 --> 02:01:21,565
the beverage service
on the plane, is that correct?

1932
02:01:21,775 --> 02:01:22,775
Yes, that's correct.

1933
02:01:22,984 --> 02:01:25,486
l suspended
the drink service on the plane.

1934
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:28,030
Are you aware that
our investigators found

1935
02:01:28,114 --> 02:01:31,700
two single service vodka bottles
in the galley trash bin?

1936
02:01:34,079 --> 02:01:35,412
Yes, l'm aware of that.

1937
02:01:36,748 --> 02:01:39,083
There were five crew members on board

1938
02:01:39,167 --> 02:01:41,752
that would have had access
to the beverage trolley.

1939
02:01:42,087 --> 02:01:44,004
Less than an hour after the accident,

1940
02:01:44,089 --> 02:01:46,048
blood was taken from each
of these crew members,

1941
02:01:46,132 --> 02:01:49,051
yourself, First Officer Evans,

1942
02:01:49,803 --> 02:01:52,137
Flight Attendant Margaret Thomason,

1943
02:01:52,764 --> 02:01:55,599
and posthumously from Camelia Satou

1944
02:01:56,267 --> 02:01:58,435
and Katerina Marquez.

1945
02:01:59,270 --> 02:02:02,606
Toxicology analysis was performed and

1946
02:02:03,108 --> 02:02:05,609
three of these tests came back negative,

1947
02:02:05,694 --> 02:02:08,612
one was disqualified
for technical reasons,

1948
02:02:08,697 --> 02:02:11,365
and one tested positive for alcohol.

1949
02:02:11,449 --> 02:02:14,451
lt registered a .1 7 blood alcohol level.

1950
02:02:14,786 --> 02:02:16,453
Are you aware of that?

1951
02:02:17,122 --> 02:02:19,289
Yeah, l'm aware of it now.

1952
02:02:26,047 --> 02:02:28,716
Miss Marquez was not only a colleague,

1953
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:31,677
but you knew her outside of work,
is that correct?

1954
02:02:33,054 --> 02:02:34,722
Outside of work?

1955
02:02:35,557 --> 02:02:36,557
No, not really.

1956
02:02:37,058 --> 02:02:39,643
Did you know Miss Marquez
had a drinking problem?

1957
02:02:40,812 --> 02:02:41,895
No, l did not.

1958
02:02:42,313 --> 02:02:44,064
Did you ever see her drink to excess?

1959
02:02:47,068 --> 02:02:48,402
No, l did not.

1960
02:02:48,653 --> 02:02:51,655
Were you aware that she was
twice treated for alcohol addiction?

1961
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:55,993
The last time was 1 6 months ago
and paid for by SouthJet Airlines.

1962
02:02:57,078 --> 02:02:58,245
No, l did not.

1963
02:03:08,715 --> 02:03:10,382
ls it your opinion

1964
02:03:10,842 --> 02:03:12,801
that Katerina Marquez

1965
02:03:13,762 --> 02:03:15,596
drank on that flight?

1966
02:03:27,233 --> 02:03:29,068
Could you repeat the question?

1967
02:03:29,402 --> 02:03:34,573
ls it your opinion that Katerina Marquez
drank on that flight?

1968
02:03:46,252 --> 02:03:47,419
l'm sorry, my what?

1969
02:03:47,504 --> 02:03:49,171
Your opinion, Captain.

1970
02:03:49,297 --> 02:03:52,257
Since her toxicology report
is the only toxicology report

1971
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:54,426
that is admissible in this hearing,

1972
02:03:54,511 --> 02:03:57,179
and she in fact tested
positive for alcohol,

1973
02:03:57,263 --> 02:03:59,848
is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez

1974
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:03,936
drank those two bottles
of vodka on the plane?

1975
02:04:13,613 --> 02:04:15,280
God help me.

1976
02:04:15,949 --> 02:04:17,032
l'm sorry, Mr. Whitaker,

1977
02:04:17,117 --> 02:04:19,284
l couldn't hear you. What did you say?

1978
02:04:21,788 --> 02:04:23,455
l said, "God help me."

1979
02:04:24,624 --> 02:04:27,543
Yes, well, however, is it your opinion...

1980
02:04:27,627 --> 02:04:28,794
lt's my opinion

1981
02:04:29,379 --> 02:04:32,881
Trina did not drink that vodka.

1982
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:34,800
Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker?

1983
02:04:34,884 --> 02:04:36,385
She saved the boy's life, that's...

1984
02:04:36,553 --> 02:04:37,803
Could you speak louder,
Captain Whitaker?

1985
02:04:37,887 --> 02:04:40,639
Trina Marquez did not drink the vodka

1986
02:04:42,308 --> 02:04:44,309
because l drank the vodka.

1987
02:04:45,979 --> 02:04:47,896
What the hell? Objection!

1988
02:04:49,566 --> 02:04:51,150
Please be seated, sir. Sir.

1989
02:04:51,234 --> 02:04:52,734
Captain Whitaker misspoke.

1990
02:04:53,403 --> 02:04:54,570
l drank the vodka bottles.

1991
02:04:54,696 --> 02:04:55,821
Didn't you hear me? l said l object!

1992
02:04:56,072 --> 02:04:58,740
Please be seated, sir.
This is not a courtroom.

1993
02:04:58,867 --> 02:04:59,867
Well, l object anyway!

1994
02:05:01,661 --> 02:05:03,996
l drank the vodka bottles on the plane.

1995
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:07,166
Captain Whitaker,

1996
02:05:07,250 --> 02:05:10,252
on the three nights
before the accident, October 1 1th...

1997
02:05:10,336 --> 02:05:12,421
October 1 1th, October 1 2th,

1998
02:05:12,505 --> 02:05:15,424
and 1 3th and 14th, l was intoxicated.

1999
02:05:15,508 --> 02:05:18,343
l drank all of those days. l drank.

2000
02:05:19,179 --> 02:05:20,512
ln excess.

2001
02:05:21,931 --> 02:05:23,432
On the morning of the accident...

2002
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:24,933
l was drunk.

2003
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:34,359
l'm drunk now.

2004
02:05:40,783 --> 02:05:44,286
l'm drunk right now, Miss Block.

2005
02:05:51,711 --> 02:05:53,712
Because l'm an alcoholic.

2006
02:06:19,239 --> 02:06:20,572
That was it.

2007
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:25,744
l was finished.

2008
02:06:27,747 --> 02:06:29,081
l was done.

2009
02:06:32,252 --> 02:06:36,421
lt was as if l had reached
my lifelong limit

2010
02:06:37,090 --> 02:06:38,423
of lies.

2011
02:06:39,259 --> 02:06:41,927
l could not tell one more lie.

2012
02:06:45,598 --> 02:06:47,432
And maybe l'm a sucker,

2013
02:06:49,602 --> 02:06:52,104
'cause if l had told just one more lie,

2014
02:06:52,438 --> 02:06:55,274
l could have walked away
from all that mess

2015
02:06:55,608 --> 02:06:59,278
and kept my wings,
kept my false sense of pride.

2016
02:07:01,948 --> 02:07:03,532
And more importantly,

2017
02:07:03,658 --> 02:07:05,200
l could have avoided being locked up

2018
02:07:05,285 --> 02:07:06,702
in here with all you

2019
02:07:07,453 --> 02:07:10,289
nice folks for the last 1 3 months.

2020
02:07:14,002 --> 02:07:15,335
But l'm here.

2021
02:07:16,629 --> 02:07:20,716
And l'll be here
for at least the next four or five years.

2022
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,134
And that's fair.

2023
02:07:25,805 --> 02:07:28,473
l betrayed the public trust. l did.

2024
02:07:28,558 --> 02:07:30,225
That's how the judge explained it to me.

2025
02:07:30,310 --> 02:07:32,811
l had betrayed the public trust.

2026
02:07:34,814 --> 02:07:37,733
The FAA, they took away
my pilot's license.

2027
02:07:39,694 --> 02:07:41,236
And that's fair.

2028
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:45,741
My chances
of ever flying again are slim to none.

2029
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:49,328
And l accept that.

2030
02:07:52,373 --> 02:07:55,208
l've had a lot of time
to think about it, all of it.

2031
02:07:57,045 --> 02:07:59,379
l've been doing some writing.

2032
02:08:01,215 --> 02:08:05,552
l wrote letters to each of the families
that had lost loved ones.

2033
02:08:08,389 --> 02:08:10,891
Some of them were able
to hear my apology.

2034
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:14,227
Some of them never will.

2035
02:08:15,897 --> 02:08:18,398
l also apologized to

2036
02:08:19,734 --> 02:08:24,404
all the people
that tried to help me along the way, but l

2037
02:08:25,698 --> 02:08:27,866
couldn't or wouldn't listen.

2038
02:08:31,746 --> 02:08:34,081
People like my wife, you know.

2039
02:08:37,418 --> 02:08:39,419
My ex-wife and

2040
02:08:43,424 --> 02:08:44,758
my son.

2041
02:08:48,262 --> 02:08:51,431
And again, like l said,
you know, some of them will

2042
02:08:53,768 --> 02:08:56,103
never forgive me. Some of them will.

2043
02:08:58,815 --> 02:09:00,649
But at least l'm sober.

2044
02:09:03,277 --> 02:09:06,446
l thank God for that. l'm grateful for that.

2045
02:09:09,492 --> 02:09:11,201
And this is going to sound real stupid

2046
02:09:11,327 --> 02:09:14,162
coming from a man
who's locked up in prison,

2047
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:18,625
but for the first time in my life,

2048
02:09:19,794 --> 02:09:21,169
l'm free.

2049
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:37,477
Whitaker. You got a visitor.

2050
02:10:15,183 --> 02:10:17,225
-You got 40 minutes.
-Okay.

2051
02:10:28,196 --> 02:10:29,863
Look at you, boy.

2052
02:10:30,406 --> 02:10:32,449
-How are you doing?
-l'm good.

2053
02:10:32,533 --> 02:10:33,742
You look good.

2054
02:10:35,036 --> 02:10:36,703
Come on, sit down.

2055
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:39,414
This is a surprise.

2056
02:10:39,874 --> 02:10:41,082
You get that gift l sent you?

2057
02:10:41,167 --> 02:10:42,375
Yeah, yeah, l got it.

2058
02:10:42,585 --> 02:10:43,835
-Yeah? You like it?
-Yeah.

2059
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:44,920
Good.

2060
02:10:46,714 --> 02:10:48,215
How's your mom?

2061
02:10:48,549 --> 02:10:49,883
Oh. She's all right.

2062
02:10:51,719 --> 02:10:56,056
My college counselor
wanted me to come and interview you.

2063
02:10:56,599 --> 02:10:57,599
Me?

2064
02:10:57,892 --> 02:11:00,894
Yeah. l'm writing essays
