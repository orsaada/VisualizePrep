[Announcer]
Let's welcome our favorite alumnus,

3
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,640
...and the next senator
from the state of New York,

4
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,680
David Norris!

5
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,490
Thank you. Thank you.

6
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,260
Well, hi, there.

7
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,400
My name is David Norris,

8
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,480
...and I'd like to be the next senator 
from the great state of New York.

9
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,150
Look at you. What's your name?

10
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,650
I'm going to go through Yonkers,
door to door...

11
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,820
- ...and take the city that way.
- We love you.

12
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,530
The recent endorsement
by the fire fighter's union...

13
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,990
...is another boost to Norris

14
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,790
...who already had a six-point lead

15
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,330
...over his opponent, Roger Linfield.

16
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,850
Whenever I see you on C-Span,
and you stand,

17
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,380
I always think you're
about to go, "Chug!"

18
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,340
Congressman,
you certainly started your career off,

19
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,820
...eight years ago, with a bang
or should I say, a bust.

20
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,310
(Chattering)

00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,030
[Bloomberg]
For the last eight years,

22
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,700
David Norris has represented Brooklyn, 
New York City and America.

23
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,990
This is my campaign chairman,
Charlie Traynor.

24
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,080
These are voters.

25
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,950
Latest polls have you up 10 points.

26
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,870
[David]
We're 10 points up?

27
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,750
This is not going to be
easy getting there.

28
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,250
I have some real opposition,

29
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,590
...and what they're saying about me

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,710
...is that I'm too young
to hold this office.

31
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,260
Win big, but run like you're 20 down.

32
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,470
Okay, you got it.

33
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,550
Thank you, Gary.

34
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,390
[David] But that's okay because these 
are the same people

35
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,600
...who say that young people don't vote,

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,970
...young people don't care about politics,

37
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,560
...but I'm here to tell you,

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,560
...your future is about
your choices, not theirs.

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,900
So, today I'd like to put them on notice

40
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,820
...because come November,
I want them to know

41
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
...that it was young people like you,

42
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,900
...who kicked their asses.

Thank you.

46

Charlie.

47
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,290

(Sighing)

50
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,010
Yeah?

51
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,530
[Richardson]
Any ideas?

52
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,930
I'm working on it.

53
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,190
Keep me posted.

54
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,180
Yeah.

55
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,980
[Newscaster]
David Norris,

56
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,610
...until recently,
he was way ahead in the polls.

57
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,190
Mary Matalin and James Carville are here.

58
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,190
Mary, this is a surprise.

59
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,820
[Mary]
It is a surprise. Such political promise.

60
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,490
This compelling story, he grew up
in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn.

61
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,530
He overcame the loss
of his entire family,

62
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,410
...his mom and his brother when he was 10,

63
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,000
...his father before he got to
high school, he got over that.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,250
He had such promise.

65
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,650
And he was the youngest person

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
...ever elected to the
House of Representatives.

67
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,760
[James] Yeah, he was elected
when he was actually 24,

68
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,880
...but he gets in a bar room fight
the night that he's elected.

69
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,340
I like this, all right.

70
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,800
Then you have this photo coming out of 
the New York Post.

71
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,010
I think the accretion of this stuff

72
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,520
...was just too much for the voters.

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,850
It reeked of some level
of immaturity here, of impulsiveness.

74
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,490
[Mary] People want maturity,
they want adults in Congress.

75
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,960
[Richardson]
Big night for us, gentlemen.

76
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,240
Everybody ready?

77
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,440
You look exhausted.

78
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,260
You should take a vacation
when all this is finished.

79
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,510
You've earned it.

80
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,180
I'm not sure the kind of tired I am

81
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,390
...can be fixed by a vacation.

82
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,550
Everybody needs a vacation,

83
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,560
...even us.

84
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,390
All right, let's get him back on track.

85
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,020
[Newscaster]
Mary, over the past couple of weeks

86
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,730
...since the photo came out,
they thought people...

87
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,570
Why are you still watching CNN?

88
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,400
[Newscaster] That it wasn't such a big 
deal, but clearly it was.

89
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,600
They called this way too early. Come on.

90
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,120
Put on your pretty
little tie and let's go.

91
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,240
(Phone Ringing)

92
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,080
Suffolk County numbers,

93
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,730
Linfield, 415, 120. Norris...

94
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,060
370,233.

95
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,580
Wow.

96
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,550
I really thought we'd win Suffolk.

97
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,030
Kings County just came in, too.

98
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,740
Well...

99
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,900
I didn't win Brooklyn.

100
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,560
It's going to be a blow out.

101
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,080
NBC has us up next.

102
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,900
I'm going to go work on my speech.

103
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,540
David...

104
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:08,990
David. Hey!

105
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,740
I'm sorry I wasted your time, Charlie.

106
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,130
NBC news is now calling the election 
for Roger Linfield.

107
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,670
After a shockingly
poor showing at both Suffolk County,

108
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,470
...and his home county, Kings,

109
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,350
...it now appears David Norris
will lose this election badly.

110
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,580
Hello?

111
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,130
Hello?

112
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,230
(Softly)
I grew up in Red Hook,

113
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,650
and I don't want to surprise anybody,

114
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,740
...but I got into a few
fistfights along the way.

115
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,030
It's not whether or not you get knocked 
down,

116
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,660
...it's what you do when you get back up.

117
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,490
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm here tonight to tell you

118
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,010
I will get back up.

119
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,510
(Sighing)

120
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,750
But tonight is not about me.

121
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,040
It is about coming together

122
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,420
...and welcoming the newest senator

123
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,220
...for the great state of New York,

124
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,290
Roger Linfield.

125
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,170
(Metal Clinks)

126
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,210
[Elise]
Shit!

127
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,370
Shit, shit, shit.

128
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,120
Hello?

129
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,610
- It's the men's.
- Yep.

130
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,200
Sorry about that.
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

131
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,600
I just didn't know what to do.

132
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,500
I heard you come in and say, "Hello,"

133
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,210
...and I probably should have said, "Hi,"

134
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,040
...but then I thought that would be weird

135
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,920
...because it's the men's.

136
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,800
Then you started talking to yourself

137
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,840
...and it was obviously very personal.

138
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,130
So I was stuck in no man's land,

139
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,800
...and then it all got to be too much,
so I came out.

140
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,960
What are you doing in here?

141
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,030
(Laughs)

142
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,200
Just...

143
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
I'm hiding from security.

144
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,270
(Laughs)
Why?

145
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,920
I crashed a wedding upstairs.

146
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,790
People still do that?

147
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,100
It was a dare.

148
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,670
Who dared you to crash a wedding?

149
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:15,900
Me.

150
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,150
Oh.

151
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,290
- I crashed a wedding once.
- Did you?

152
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,750
Yeah, in high school.

153
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:23,990
Oh.

154
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,550
But I got caught.
I spent the night in jail.

155
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,760
I think that happened more than once 
from what I heard.

156
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,220
You're that guy
running for Senate, aren't you?

157
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,820
Yeah, I am that guy.

158
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,560
And judging from your speech,
you're not winning?

159
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:38,800
No.

160
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,060
Oh. That's too bad,
the other guy is such a tool.

161
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,730
(Laughing)
He is a tool.

162
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,690
I wish I could have made that clearer 
in the campaign ads.

163
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,570
Personally, I think mooning your friends

164
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,150
...at a college reunion is no big deal.

165
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,280
The Post did not have to run the photo.

166
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,450
(Exhales)
At least not a full page.

167
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,090
God, no.

168
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,900
(Both Laughing)

169
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,870
It was my favorite moment
of your whole campaign.

170
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,830
Really? I could have used you on my team

171
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,290
...a couple of months ago.

172
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,460
I could help poll test

173
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,250
...every word that comes
out of your mouth before you say it.

174
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,630
Oh, you like politicians?

175
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,840
I like it when they do
stuff I can relate to.

176
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,260
- Like pull their pants down?
- I love that.

177
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,510
See, that kind of candidate wouldn't 
even get elected to the student council.

178
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,560
My guy would know
how to tie his own tie.

179
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,680
It's a clip-on.

180
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,560
Oh, I wish.

181
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,520
That would have been my other
favorite moment of your campaign.

182
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,190
Do you still have a chance?

183
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,070
Is it over?

184
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,190
He crushed me.

185
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,060
(Exhales)
Sorry.

186
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,490
Well, losing has its advantages.

187
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,290
Like what?

188
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,210
For one thing, as a politician,
you're never really alone

189
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,880
...unless you're asleep,
or in the bathroom usually.

190
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,000
That gets old.

191
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:51,900
Really?

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,590
Yeah, I guess I'm mostly just looking 
forward

193
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,230
...to having some time by myself.

194
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,060
I don't buy it. I think you love it.

195
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,810
Do I know you?

196
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,400
(Both Laugh)

197
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,320
I guess I could have been more convincing.

198
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,720
Okay.

199
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,950
You don't have to worry about being 
convincing till the next election.

200
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,040
Are you a registered New York voter?

201
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,720
Do I sound like I am?

202
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,190
Holy shit.

203
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,050
[Charlie]
David.

204
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,490
Oh. Wow, sorry, guys.

205
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,900
- Sorry.
- I got to go.

206
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,260
Sorry.

207
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,360
- Wow.
- Hang on.

208
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,200
- You going to give your speech?
- Hang on.

209
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,520
Hey!

210
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,310
Hey.

211
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:08,730
Ma'am.

212
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,370
I got to go.

213
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,150
Ma'am?

214
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,170
That is so much better.

215
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,610
She's on the move.

216
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,300
Southwest staircase.

217
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,660
Excuse me? Ma'am.

218
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,090
What was that?

219
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,130
I don't know.

220
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,220
Are you ready?

221
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,730
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,270
All right, go do the speech. Come on.

223
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,230
[Announcer]
Congressman David Norris.

224
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,390
(All Cheering)

225
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,110
I grew up not far away from here, in 
Red Hook.

226
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,280
- [Man] Brooklyn!
- [Woman] I love you, David!

227
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,990
[Woman #2]
I love you more!

228
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,270
I love you both.

229
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,610
(All Laughing)

230
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,500
But we had a rule in my neighborhood.

231
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,420
When you got in a fight,

232
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,290
...it wasn't whether or not
you got knocked down,

233
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,570
...it's what you do when you get back up.

234
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,060
(Cheering)

235
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,930
And I came here to tell you tonight,

236
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,850
...that I will get back up.

237
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,610
(Cheering)

238
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,610
It's bullshit.

239
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,870
We didn't have that saying in my 
neighborhood.

240
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,270
It's just one of those phrases

241
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,170
...that had some traction
with the focus group

242
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,210
...and so we kept using it,
but it's not true.

243
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,090
In 1998, I did a cover story for GQ.

244
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,340
The title was "Youngest Congressman 
Ever."

245
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,260
And since then, every story has tried

246
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,220
...to explain how I got here so fast.

247
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,010
And the word that
people kept using was "authentic."

248
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,310
(All Cheering)

249
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,780
But here's the problem.

250
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,000
This isn't even my tie.

251
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,370
- Go get Jim for me.
- This tie was selected for me

252
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,450
...by a group of specialists
in Tenafly, New Jersey

253
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,220
...who chose it over
56 other ties we tested. 

254
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,790
In fact, our data suggests that I have 
to stick to

255
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,930
...either a tie that is red
or a tie that is blue.

256
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,640
A yellow tie made it look as if I was 
taking my situation lightly,

257
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,270
...and I may in fact,
pull my pants down again at any moment.

258
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,390
(All Laughing)

259
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,860
A silver tie meant that I'd forgotten 
my roots.

260
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,440
My shoes...

261
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,330
You know, shiny shoes,

262
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,810
...we associate
with high-priced lawyers and bankers.

263
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,530
If you want to get a working man's vote,

264
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,290
...you need to scuff up
your shoes a little bit.

265
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,750
But you can't scuff them up so much

266
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,410
...that you alienate the lawyers
and the bankers

267
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,290
...because you need them to pay for
the specialists back in Tenafly.

268
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,840
So, what is the proper scuffing amount?

269
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,000
Do you know we actually paid a 
consultant $7,300...

270
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,800
Was it $7,300, Charlie?

271
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,560
Nice. What an asshole.

272
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,430
$7,300, for a consultant to tell us 
that this is the perfect amount of 
scuffing.

273
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,870
(Cameras Clicking)

274
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,220
He has to spill his coffee on his shirt 
by 7:05.

275
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,980
7:05 at the latest.

276
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,500
I'll get him as soon as he enters the 
park.

277
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,300
Can't imagine being on this guy as long 
as you have.

278
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,380
(Breathing Deeply)

279
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,690
(Alarm Beeping)

280
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,710
[Newscaster]
...for energy efficient technologies.

281
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,840
RSR Venture Capital announced yesterday

282
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,300
...that former Congressman David Norris,
would become a senior partner.

283
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,510
Norris led an unsuccessful bid for 
Senate last month.

284
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,180
But his concession speech was 
considered, by many, to be electrifying

285
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,180
...and has made him the obvious
front runner in the 2010 Senate race.

286
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,980
Investment banker Charles Traynor 
founded RSR,
(Phone Ringing)

287
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,190
...one of the country's
most successful venture capital firms.

288
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,280
Traynor is a childhood friend of Norris'

289
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,020
...and was the Chairman
of his Senate campaign.

290
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,990
- Hey!
- Hey.

291
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,700
Tom Frankel from The Journal is 
calling you in five minutes.

292
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,030
I just gave him this number.

293
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,490
Give him 3-2-2-7. I'm not used to this 
phone yet.

294
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,790
No, I can't. He's going to ask you 
about joining the firm.

295
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,290
All business calls have to be done on a 
company Blackberry.

296
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,450
- Really?
- Sarbanes-Oxley,

297
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,670
...you voted for it, pal.
In fact, you co-sponsored that one.

298
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,030
Yeah, I remember.

299
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,260
Hey, I just saw you on TV.

300
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,420
- Really?
- Yeah.

301
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,550
What did they say?

302
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,510
You're bald.

303
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,710
(Laughs)
Nice.

304
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,970
Yeah, it was weird, too, because it was 
a financial show.

305
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,480
But they were really captivated by your 
receding hairline.

306
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,310
I got to go, you jack-off.

307
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:23,630
Bye.

308
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,340
[Man]
Congressman.

309
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,570
I have to tell you, I really admire 
what you did last month.

310
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,910
Thank you. I appreciate it.

311
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,660
I wish there were more politicians like 
you.

312
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,450
Thank you. I'm retired now.

313
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,700
I had to go get a real job.

314
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,820
- (Laughs) You'll do well.
- Thank you.

315
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,870
(Inhales Sharply)

316
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,610
[Harry]
Hey!

317
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,280
You got a guy running for the bus.

318
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,030
There is another M6 right behind me.

319
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,350
Hey!

320
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,350
No way.

321
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,070
Sorry.

322
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,560
Oh, my God.

323
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,810
Have we met?

324
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,140
You look vaguely familiar.

325
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,270
- Waldorf men's room.
- You got it.

326
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,520
Were you just staring
at my legs while I slept?

327
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,820
I was defenseless
against the small dress.

328
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,860
It's a skirt.

329
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,310
It's a belt.
(Elise Laughing)

330
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,330
What is it with you and the argyle?

331
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,870
What is the deal with you and the 
boring shades of blue?

332
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,000
My clothes match.

333
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,620
Did your team pick that out for you?

334
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,000
No team. Team is gone.

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,750
- Wow.
- I did it all by myself.

336
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,470
(Panting)

337
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,780
I saw your speech.

338
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,160
Yeah, the speech.

339
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,760
Something must have got into me.

340
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,010
(Cell Phone Ringing)

341
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,850
Wow, that is something.

342
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,050
Really augments the moment.

343
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,310
[Man] (Murmuring)
Nice ring, asshole.

344
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,350
Hello? Hello?

345
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,060
It doesn't even work.

346
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,400
Could that ringer get louder

347
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,610
...or do you have that maxed out?

348
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,970
It's a new phone.

349
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,270
Are you going to run again?

350
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,580
Don't know.
I'm starting a new job today.

351
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,870
You have to run again.
You can't do that.

352
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,870
The country will end up being run by 
tools like Linfield.

353
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,990
It kind of is.

354
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,310
(Grunts)

355
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:58,890
Oh, shit.

356

(David And Elise Exclaim)

357
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,150
[David]
Sorry. I don't know what just happened.

358
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,190
(Groaning)

359
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,600
Are you okay?

360
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,900
I'm fine. Can you hand me that?

361
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,140
- You sure you okay?
- Yeah.

362
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,950
- I'll pay for the dry cleaning.
- No, it's really fine.

363
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,390
Please don't. Wow.

364
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,870
Seven bucks will probably cover it.

365
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,830
You keep that, you might need it.

366
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,000
You know what? Here.

367
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,250
You write your number down

368
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,540
...then I can call you and
come pick up your skirt.

369
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,140
Oh, my goodness, me.

370
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,020
That is very smooth.

371
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,480
Oh, shit.

372
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,020
Why don't you let me spill some on you 
and then we'll be even?

373
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,940
- That's a terrible idea.
- I think it's a great idea.

374
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,100
Just one bit because that's not fair.

375
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,570
You actually are crazy.
No, now it all makes sense.

376
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,770
(Phone Ringing)
Okay, hang on. Oh, jeez.

377
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,500
He's not here. I know, I'm sorry.

378
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,450
- Who was that?
- I don't know. Who cares?

379
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,580
It'll be on the... Can you just... No.
- It'll be on the... Can you just...
- No.

380
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,490
Okay, now we're in the third grade. 
This is great.

It's a sturdy little fucker, isn't it?

383
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,350
I'm sorry. I don't know what happened, 
it just happened.

384
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:19,780
Okay.

385
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,340
- Okay, that was a new phone.
- Let's wipe it off.

386
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,640
I'm Elise, by the way.

387
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,160
I'll remember that.

(Cars Honking)

389
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,250
- That's my number.
- Terrific, thank you.

390
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,980
I'll call you.

391
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,690
The morning after the election,

392
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,010
I woke up thinking about you.

393
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,500
Hey, man, what's up?

394
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,340
[David] You're not going to believe
who I just ran into.

395
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,660
Who?

396
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,590
The girl from election night.

397
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,510
- The one you kissed?
- She kissed me.

398
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,720
You still sticking with that story?

399
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,350
- It's the truth.
- Whatever, dude.

400
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,180
They're ready for you in the main 
conference room.

401
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,100
What are the odds? It's amazing.

402
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,270
That's great, man, just don't take her 
advice on speeches anymore.

403
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,190
First time worked, it's not going to 
work again.

404
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,770
You're just jealous because it's the 
best speech I ever gave

405
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,940
...and you didn't write it.

406
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,200
Just so you know, I think I'm coming 
down against your solar panel thing.

407
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,520
Why?

408
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,280
I just don't think the research is there

409
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,370
...and the price point is too
high on these things.

410
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,620
Of course, it's too high.

411
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,250
But if our company doesn't get involved 
with stuff like this, who will?

412
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,620
Convince me in the meeting.

413
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,460
I will. See you, buddy.

414
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,850
Hey, Janet.

415
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,900
Hey, Susan.

416
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,460
[Richardson] We just got approval for a 
recalibration on the Lasalle case.

417
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,420

What the hell are you doing?

421
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:28,650
Grab him.

422

9-1-1, Janet! 9-1 -1! Oh.

You can't get away, David.

David, I really wish
you'd just listen to me.

425

All right, I'll handle it.

David,

428
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,150
...you really are making this
harder than it has to be.

00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:29,950
(Grunting)

430
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,290
[Harry] All right, take it easy,
guys. Take it easy.

431
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,330
Take it easy.

432
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,190
It's okay, David.

433
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,090
[Richardson] (Distorted)
No. No, sir.

434
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
It's being taken care of.

435
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,940
Yes, sir. It's being taken care of.

436
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,040
Yes, sir. No, sir.

437
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,590
No, sir. Yes, sir.

438
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,070
I understand. I'll take care of it.

439
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,570
What a goddamn mess.

440
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,090
- Donaldson?
- Yes.

441
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,580
[McCrady]
What do you want to do?

442
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,040
We have to reset him.
Call for a briefcase.

443
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,580
[McCrady] You kidding? It's going to 
take a signed order from the Chairman.

444
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,710
[Richardson]
Get legal on it.

445
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,190
[Burdensky]
Legal just arrived.

446
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,920
There's no way
the Chairman approves a reset.

447
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,840
This is your fault.
There is no way you get a briefcase.

448

Hey.

449
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,300
- [Richardson] What are my options?
- Hey.

450
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,680
Just bullshit him.

451
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,120
Bullshit this guy?

452
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,260
Hey! What's going on here?

453
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,100
Look at this.

454
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,770
Questions will burn in him till the day 
he dies.

455
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:47,060
[Richardson] He won't stop searching for 
answers. He won't quit.

456
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,660
We have to watch him

457
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,570
...forever, make sure he doesn't talk.

458
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,410
Endless ripple effects.

459
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,820
You remember the Torres case
40 years ago?

460
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,820
It's not that bad, is it?

461
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,790
In the end, they just leveled with him.

462
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,670
Completely?

463
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Looking at that,
I don't see you have a choice.

464
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,160
Who the hell are you guys?

465
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,170
We

466
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,600
...are the people who make sure things
happen according to plan.

467
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,180
My name is Richardson.

468
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,420
Oh.

469
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,770
(Exclaiming)

470
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,700
(Groans)

471
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,120
You really think I couldn't
see that coming?

472
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,800
I can read your mind.

473
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,280
Yeah, really.

474
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,330
Pick a color.

475
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:43,900
Blue.

476
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,750
Pick a number. Seventeen.

477
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,430
Now, why are you still
thinking about running?

478
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,770
(Panting)

479
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,300
I don't really know what's going on here.

480
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,680
You've just seen behind a curtain

481
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,260
...that you weren't supposed
to know existed.

482
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,540
Must be jarring.

483
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,740
It's not your fault.

484
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,140
Your path through the world this morning

485
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,350
...was supposed to have been adjusted.

486
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,690
You were supposed to spill your coffee

487
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,860
...as you entered the park this morning.

488
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,360
You would have gone upstairs to change,

489
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,820
...you would have missed the bus,

490
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,150
...and you would have arrived at work

491
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,150
10 minutes later than you did,

492
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,860
...and we would have been gone.

493
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,820
I was supposed to spill my coffee?

494
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,980
We call that an adjustment.

495
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,200
See, sometimes, when
people spill their coffee

496
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,540
...or their Internet goes out

497
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,250
...or they misplaced their keys,
they think it's chance.

498
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,850
And sometimes it is.

499
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,420
Sometimes it's us...
(Tires Squealing)

500
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,900
...nudging people back on plan.

501
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,050
Sometimes when nudging isn't enough,

502
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,180
...management authorizes a recalibration.

503
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,660
We deploy our Intervention Team

504
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,230
...and they change your mind for you,

505
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,430
...like we did with your friend Charlie.

506
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,440
He's fine, by the way.

507
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,030
You don't need to worry about him.

508
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,510
Now...

509
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,450
There is something I need you to 
understand if I'm going to let you go.

510
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:01,850
Okay.

511
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,330
Very few humans have seen
what you've seen today,

512
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,790
...and we're determined
to keep it that way.

513
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,750
So, if you ever reveal our existence,

514
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,920
...we'll erase your brain.

515
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,710
The Intervention Team will reset you.

516
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,960
Your emotions, your memories,

517
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,880
...your entire personality
will be expunged.

518
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,850
Your friends and family will
think you've gone crazy.

519
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,850
You won't think anything.

520
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,640
You understand?

521
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,870
Not one word about us.

522
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,220
Okay.

523
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,950
Oh, one more thing, you bumped into a 
woman this morning on the bus.

524
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,430
Elise?

525
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,950
What does that have to do with anything?

526
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,230
You were never supposed to see her again.

527
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,800
What does that matter?

528
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,690
Because it matters.

529
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:00,660
- [McCrady] It's in his wallet.
- Hey, hey. God! Hey!

530
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,080
What's with you guys? Jesus!

531
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,950
Oh, come on. No! No!

532
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,930
What the hell?

533
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,330
Really?

534
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,600
What the hell?

535
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:18,970
Okay.

536
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,070
- Okay.
- Take him back.

537
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,200
Enjoy the rest of your day.

538
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,000
I can walk. I'm capable of walking.

539
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,220
Dude, what are you doing on my floor?

540
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:47,340
You know, I called you like 10 times, 
you could have picked up.

541
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,020
Christine, I found him.
He's in my office.

542
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,260
What the hell are you doing?

543
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Round up the guys,
we're going to do the meeting now.

544
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,080
You have a headache?

545
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,030
What is wrong with you?

546
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,390
Hey, we're in the big conference room 
on 17. Let's go.

547
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,260
Morning, Congressman.

548
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,300
You sure you're okay?

549
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,100
Yeah, you?

550
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,210
I'm great, why?

551
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,930
You don't have a headache or anything?

552
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,850
No, I feel fantastic, man.

553
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,720
Is it me or this an odd conversation?

554
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,220
[Woman]
On David's solar panel deal,

555
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,680
our tech guy has serious doubts

556
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,770
...about the efficiency
ratings they're claiming.

557
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,060
They'd need a 20-fold improvement
over anything anyone else

558
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,190
...has been able to manufacture at that 
price point to really be a game-changer.

559
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,950
[Man] You're opposed to this anyway, 
Charlie. And with these financials...

560
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,110
[Charlie]
Whoa, whoa. I know it's a risk,

561
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,330
...but if our company doesn't take a chance
on something like this, then who will?

562
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:56,750
I mean, I'm willing to take a fire on 
something that could change the world.

563
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,950
Not to mention, be incredibly lucrative.

564
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:05,610
David?

565
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,740
Yeah, I mean, it's why
I took the job here.

566
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,560
[Charlie]
All right.

567
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,520
Let's do it.

568
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,620
Come into my office for a second.

569
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,840
Something is wrong.

570
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:34,580
A couple of hours ago you miraculously 
reunite with the girl of your dreams.

571
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:39,540
Explain to me why you don't have
an ear-to-ear grin right now.

572
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,820
I lost her number.

573
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:46,820
What?

574
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,940
The woman on the bus.

575
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:56,430
I lost her phone number
and all I had was her first name, so,

576
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,030
I'm never going to see her again.

577
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,910
I'm sorry.

578
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,870
Wow, I'm really sorry.

579
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,870
[Harry]
Your entire world is turned upside down

580
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,830
...and you're thinking about a woman.

581
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,830
Even if you could remember the number,

582
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,420
...you'll never get through.

583
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,710
Lost cell phone, changed numbers,

584
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,670
...whatever creates the fewest ripples.

585
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,990
My name is Harry, by the way.

586
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,240
The fewest ripples?

587
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,430
You freeze people. You froze my friend.

588
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,390
We need special authorization to...

589
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,020
...Poke around in people's brains.

590
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,190
You make them think whatever you want...

591
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,470
Be quiet, David.

592
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,610
Can I get you something?

593
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,530
Just some water, please.

594
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,610
Your friend will be fine.

595
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,320
Re-calibrations make tiny changes
in the way people reason.

596
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,280
It doesn't work on
emotion or personality.

597
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,540
That's too intrusive.

598
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,000
You said authorization.
Authorization from who?

599
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,040
The Chairman.

600
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,410
The Chairman?

601
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,220
(Shushing)

602
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,790
That's just a name we use.

603
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,420
You use many other names.

604
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,740
We can't talk here.

605
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:00,950
Meet me on the 4:00 p.m. boat
and I'll answer what I can.

606
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,730
If you reveal us,
even if it's unintentional...

607
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,560
I know. You'll bump me on the head.

608
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,400
Richardson has automatic
authority to reset you.

609
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,160
You mean lobotomize me?

610
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,250
Try not to forget it.

611
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,610
Be on the 4:00 p.m. boat.

612
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:38,070
Ask your questions,
I'll tell you what I can.

613
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,350
What were they doing to Charlie?

614
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,270
Just changing the way he weighs 
investment risks

615
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:47,600
which will subtly shift the direction of
his company in the way upstairs wants.

616
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,770
So, Richardson could read my mind?

617
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,730
Richardson was trying to scare you.

618
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,440
No, he knew the number I was thinking 
of, the color.

619
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,280
Because he set it up as a choice.

620
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,530
"Choose a color, choose a number."

621
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,910
We can't read your mind
or hear your thoughts.

622
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,290
When you make a decision,
your mind weighs options.

623
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,750
We can perceive them.

624
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,420
We know when you're going to go off the 
plan or not because

625
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,040
...if we're close enough,

626
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,510
we can sense when it's going to happen.

627
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,220
We're just here to keep you on plan.

628
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,680
That's all we're authorized to do.

629
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,470
Are you allowed to be
telling me this stuff?

630
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,470
Are they following me now?

631
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,220
We have to monitor the entire world.

632
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:28,600
We don't have the manpower to follow 
everyone all the time.

633
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,610
And there is something about water.

634
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,610
It blocks our ability
to read your decision tree.

635
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,970
Are you an angel?

636
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,320
We've been called that.

637
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,320
We're more like case officers

638
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,040
who live a lot longer than humans.

639
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,830
Why are you helping me?

640
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,270
I have my reasons.

641
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,250
And why won't they let me be with Elise?

642
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,840
All I know is the amount
of resources they've used

643
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,480
...keeping you from her is pretty damn 
important to them.

644
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,800
You're going to look
for her, aren't you?

645
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,320
You won't find her.

646
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,640
They'll make sure of it.

647
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,020
Even if they weren't trying to stop you,

648
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,190
...there are nine million
people in this city.

649
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,950
You'll never find her.

650
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,760
Forget about her.

651
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,200
Move on with your life.

652
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,910
(Alarm Beeping)

653
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,210
Stop! Stop the bus!

654
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,320
Elise? Elise, hi.

655
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,530
David.

656
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,890
You know, I rode the M6
to work every day for three years

657
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,530
...hoping that I'd bump into you.

658
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,020
Listen, is there a place
we could go and talk?

659
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,740
(Sighing)

660
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,480
Don't you have to get to work or 
something?

661
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,690
I just got sick.

662
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,570
"I haven't seen you in three years,
you make me sick."

663
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,570
That's not an ideal come-on, just so 
you know.

664
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,780
What are you looking for?
(Cell Phone Ringing)

665
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,780
I felt like someone was watching us.

666
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,410
Hey, Charlie,
I'm going to have to skip breakfast,

667
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,410
...and I probably have to postpone the 
speech, too. I just bumped into Elise.

668
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,990
You just hung up on your friend.

669
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,450
We've known each other since we were kids.

670
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,830
- What speech?
- It doesn't matter. 

671
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,830
- You want to take a walk?
- No.

672
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:36,960
We have a lot to catch up on.

673
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,340
I don't think you should cancel your 
speech.

674
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,460
What if I don't like you at the end of 
our walk?

675
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,880
I'll take my chances.

676
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,510
Seriously, my number hasn't changed,

677
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,590
just call me like you didn't last time.

678
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,100
Look, if you take a walk with me,
I'll explain why.

679
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,720
It's been years. How do you know I 
don't have a nice boyfriend?

680
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,680
Do you have a nice boyfriend?

681
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,100
Would it matter if I did?

682
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,500
Yeah.

683
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,190
So you don't have any
real conviction then?

684
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,570
Okay, it wouldn't matter at all.

685
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,690
So, you don't mind being a home-wrecker?

686
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:03,860
[Man]
Congressman!

687
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,360
How are you doing, man? I'm from Red 
Hook. You're the best.

688
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,520
Thank you. Good to see you.

689
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,040
If you were married, then it would 
bother me.

690
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,540
But now you're just saying what you 
think I want to hear.

691
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,420
I'm single.

692
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Now let's hear your bullshit excuse for 
not calling me.

693
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,170
I didn't have your number.

694
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,840
I gave it you on the bus.
Handed it to you.

695
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
I was mugged. It was taken from me.

696
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,800
No, come on.

697
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,470
- My wallet was taken.
- Come on.

698
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,430
Why else would I fawn all
over you on a bus

699
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,890
...three years ago and
then never call you?

700
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,890
Because, I don't know! You have a 
girlfriend and you felt terrible.

701
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:38,690
Listen, I swear to you that I did not 
have your number.

702
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,490
All right.

703
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,890
No, on my parents' graves.

704
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,480
That's heavy.

705
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,990
That's too heavy, I know, but it's true.

706
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,650
I didn't have your number.

707
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,570
And I didn't even have
a last name to go by.

708
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,700
If you Google just "Elise,"

709
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,740
- you get 757,000 hits.
- You did not.

710
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,990
And none of them are you.

711
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,200
We have a problem.

712
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:08,700
What?

713
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
David Norris is off plan.

714
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,060
(Sighs)
Son of a bitch. How did he find her?

715
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,890
Chance. Just spotted her on the street.

716
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,150
We never should have let him meet her 
in the first place.

717
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,440
We followed protocol to the letter.

718
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,150
Guy rides the same bus every day for 
three years.

719
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,270
Who does that?

720
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,730
Three years later,
I'm still cleaning up your mess.

721
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,120
(Chattering)

722
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,820
Let's cut the power at her dance studio.

723
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,460
I'm a dancer.

724
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:44,830
Oh.

725
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,380
Not like that, you pervert.

726
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,130
I'm in a contemporary ballet company.

727
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,840
I think you have the wrong idea about me.

728
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,550
No, I think that was the first thing 
that crossed your mind, actually.

729
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,060
I think you should invite me to one of 
your performances.

730
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,930
The company is called Cedar Lake,

731
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,140
...and there is actually
a show tomorrow night, if you want.

732
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,310
- Is that an invitation?
- No, it's information.

733
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,150
We're covering the girl's
artistic director

734
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,150
...and we're still working
on Charlie Traynor.

735
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,070
This whole thing will be over in an hour.

736
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,280
[David]
Hi, how are you? Paul, right?

737
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,490
[Paul]
How did you remember that?

738
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,990
[David]
I'm a politician,
I'm good with names.

739
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,200
Her decision tree is diverging
from our models.

740
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,290
[Paul]
It's just the two of you?

741
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,250
[David]
Yes.

742
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,120
[Richardson]
Thirty-six hours without contact,

743
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,460
...she'll never speak to him again.

744
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,580
Look at her file.

745
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,920
It's the last thing
in the world she'll put up with.

746
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,130
No, something is wrong.
I'm already seeing inflection points.

747
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,730
(Richardson Sighing)

748
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,100
You okay?

749
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:32,950
Yeah.

750
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,430
We're in motion on changing the 
location of her rehearsal.

751
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,140
You have to be born with the right body

752
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,190
...like very flexible hips
and shoulders and long neck.

753
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,270
And you weren't?

754
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,070
No, I was. I was lucky.

755
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,610
But after 15 years of that precision 
and the training...

756
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,860
How is everything over here?

757
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,280
It's great. Thank you.

758
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,960
It's good, thank you.

759
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,210
[Elise] So, I wanted to try something 
else just on my own,

760
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,850
...open-ended and human, I guess.

761
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
[David]
What do you mean?

762
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,150
Look.

763
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,970
What's this?

764
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,590
If they kiss.

765
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,460
A kiss? That's all it takes?

766
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:17,850
A real kiss.

767
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,760
If that happens,
every possible adjustment

768
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,930
...strong enough to break them up

769
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,600
...will cause ripples over your limit.

770
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,320
(Sighing)

771
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,270
I think that everything
you go through in life

772
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,440
...should come out in the
way that you dance.

773
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,360
I haven't found that to be the case 
with my dancing.

774
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,160
(Laughing)

775
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,860
[Elise]
It's a shame.

776
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,860
David, hate to interrupt.

777
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,580
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to see you again, Elise.

778
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,740
How did you find me?

779
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,940
Does it matter?

780
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:42,630
Nice work.

781
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,250
[Charlie] There's a crowd of people 
waiting for your announcement speech

782
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,620
at the Brooklyn Bridge right now.

783
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,750
You're announcing today?
You can't skip this for me.

784
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,420
I know. I told you I'm not
going to let you out of my sight.

785
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,380
- David, what the hell?
- Do you want to come?

786
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,590
Do you want to watch?

787
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,220
No. I can't, I have to go and rehearse.

788
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,100
Actually, I just heard that they're 
moving my rehearsal

789
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,850
...to Pier 17, right next to the bridge.

790
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,890
You know what,
why don't we just postpone it?

791
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,350
- We'll do the speech another time.
- No, David, come on, you can't do that.

792
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,150
Thank you.

793
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,520
- You have to go.
- Check.

794
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,320
David, she's rehearsing so close.

795
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,110
It'll take you three minutes to get 
there after the speech.

796
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:12,910
All right.

797
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,920
Just come over when you're done.

798
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,950
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

799
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,160
[Richardson]
Have Charlie's aide call him now.

800
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,760
(Cell Phone Ringing)

801
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,120
[David]
Are you sure you don't want a ride?

802
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,960
No, I have to go home and change.

803
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,670
You're so late.
Your friend is about to cry.

804
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,910
I'm wrangling him right now.

805
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,000
Yeah, I know.

806
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,710
Shifting her rehearsal to Pier 17

807
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,170
...was a genius move.

808
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,640
We're not out of the woods yet.

809
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,300
Come over when you're done.

810
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,940
(Chimes)

811
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,470
- [Charlie] David.
- Okay.

812
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:48,310
Sorry, the TV crew is there. We got to 
go, man.

813
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,820
We're okay.

814
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,170
(Sighing In Relief)

815
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,780
Look, whatever happens,

816
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,990
I'm not going to let anything come 
between us again.

817
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,390
Okay.

818
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,270
I'll see you soon.

819
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,820
(People Cheering)

820
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,110
Hey, how you doing?

821
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,960
Thank you. Appreciate it.

822
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,130
How are you?

823
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,520
Thanks a lot. Good to see you, too.

824
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,320
Thank you.

825
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,360
I have to say,
it's good to be back in Brooklyn.

826
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,610
There's been a lot of speculation

827
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,200
- ...as to whether or not...
- [McCrady] It's done.

828
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,740
...I would run for a Senate seat here 
in the state of New York.

829
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,370
I came here today
to put an end to that speculation

830
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,370
...and to tell you, unequivocally,

831
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:51,750
I will seek the Senate seat
for the great state of New York.

832
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:52,870
(All Cheering)

833
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,800
[Spectators] (Chanting)
David! David!

834
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,650
(Cell Phone Chimes)

835
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:08,710
Shit.

836
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,690
Don't forget, I added the bankers' group

837
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,330
...after The Daily Show tomorrow.

838
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,990
Are you listening to me?

839
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,300
David?

840
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,250
I cannot get a break on this case.

841
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,900
Okay. I got to get to Pier 17.

842
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,960
Do the interview and you can do 
whatever you want.

843
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,920
Just handle the interviews for me.
I'll talk to those guys...

844
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,300
This has got to go on the nightly news.

845
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,840
I got to see Elise right now.

846
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,970
Every time we get close,

847
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,610
...you do something to mess this up.

848
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,540
This is different.

849
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,500
(Panting)

850
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,040
[Operator]
City, please?

851
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:14,840
Manhattan.

852
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,250
What listing?

853
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,270
Cedar Lake. It's a dance company.

854
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,180
Connecting.

855
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:24,190
(Beeps)

856
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,980
He's going to ask the parking attendant 
to use the hard line.

857
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,580
I already killed it.

858
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,020
Excuse me, can I use your phone?

859
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,620
I have an emergency.

860
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,080
(Engaged Tone Beeping)

861
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,580
[McCrady]
Restaurant across the street.

862
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,220
Mmm-hmm.

863
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,290
I took out everything for three blocks.

864
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,080
This guy is a pain in the ass.

865
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,480
Come on, let's go talk to him.

866
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,880
There is a whole world
of women out there.

867
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,430
I thought we established
this one was off limits.

868
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,050
It's been a while,
I must have forgotten.

869
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,970
Doesn't change the fact.

870
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,140
[David]
You put us together three times.

871
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,100
That wasn't us, that was just chance.

872
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,900
Why do you want to keep us apart?

873
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,230
Because the plan says so.

874
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,860
Then you misread the plan.

875
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,190
There is no misreading the plan
when it comes to you and Elise.

876
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,400
Then the plan is wrong.

877
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,860
- Do you know who wrote it?
- I don't care.

878
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:30,020
You should.
You should really show a little respect.

879
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,540
If I'm not supposed to be with her,

880
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,960
...how come I feel like this?

881
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,120
It doesn't matter how you feel.

882
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,560
What matters is what
is in black and white.

883
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,260
You don't know why I'm not supposed to 
be with her, do you?

884
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,860
That's why you can't tell me.
You don't know.

885
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,250
[Richardson]
Who is this guy?

886
00:46:58,810 --> 00:46:59,290
Uh-oh.

887
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,830
Excuse me, everyone.

888
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:05,400
Sorry to disturb your lunch.
It's an emergency.

889
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,570
Has anyone here ever seen a performance 
at the Cedar Lake Ballet Company?

890
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,490
The Cedar Lake Ballet Company?

891
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,580
[Man]
Yeah, I have.

892
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,540
Where is it?

893
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,990
Son of a bitch.

894
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:26,790
Hey, taxi. Hey!

895
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,400
Taxi! Hey!

896
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:37,830
(Vehicles Honking)

897
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:41,460
Taxi!

898
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,530
Maybe you should try the subway.

899
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,490
Don't all these taxis
you're diverting have plans, too?

900
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:53,240
How long you going to keep that up? 
Twenty minutes? An hour?

901
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,040
Wow, the ripples must just be endless.

902
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,520
I don't care what you put in my way, 
I'm not giving up.

903
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,620
Hey! Hey! Hey!

904
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:09,620
Taxi!

905
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:10,790
Hey!

906
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,430
You all right?

907
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,620
You okay?

908
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,100
What happened?

909
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,270
You got hit. Are you okay?

910
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,480
- I think so.
- Don't move.

911
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,320
You all right?

912
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,990
Hello, I just witnessed an accident

913
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:40,370
...on the corner of Water
and Dover Street.

914
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,540
Unfortunately,
you're the only witness, Congressman.

915
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,830
[David]
But we did this three times already.

916
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:46,310
I just need a few more details.

917
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,140
Oh, I see.

918
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,710
You're not even a cop, are you?
You're one of them.

919
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,390
- Calm down.
- Okay.	

920
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,130
Someone could have been killed.

921
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,680
Sir, if you would just calm down.

922
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,800
Hey, Sergeant.

923
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,680
Hi. Sorry, excuse me,
I know you need a statement from me,

924
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,680
...but do I need to stay here
or can I do it over the phone?

925
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,520
No, sir, we know how
to get in touch with you.

926
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,880
Okay. Now, is this man
under your command?

927
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,910
Never mind. Thank you.

928
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,410
Hey, hey, hey!

929
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:23,830
You want to make a quick 100 bucks?

930
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,420
You're going to have to break a couple 
of traffic laws.

931
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:31,700
All right, 26th and 10th.
It's a ballet company called Cedar Lake.

932
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,370
Go through that.

933
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:37,770
Look out!

934
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:38,940
Watch it.

935
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,240
[David] This is going to keep happening, 
just go through.

936
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,050
Son of a bitch!

937
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,860
- Set a traffic jam on Broadway.
- Too many ripples.

938
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,190
He's getting out of range.

939
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,160
I don't know what to do with this. 
You're reaching your limit.

940
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:57,480
Hey!

941
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,040
Excuse me.

942
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:06,810
Two down. Two down.

943
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:09,810
Oh, shit!

944
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,640
Next one.

945
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,620
I hate downtown.

946
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:23,830
Sorry.

947
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,270
I've got inflection points.

948
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:32,110
All he needs to do is see her dance and 
you're at your ripple limit.

949
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,280
What? All right, block the door.

950
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,490
He's already through it.

951
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,780
Not that one, the next one.

952
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,580
Excuse me.

953
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,870
David Norris, I'm here to see Elise.

954
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,630
I'm blocking them all.

955
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:43,840
Hat! Hat!

956
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,100
- Is she here?
- Yeah, she's in the studio. 

957
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:55,300
[McCrady]
It's too late. He's already seen her.

958
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,710
You hit your ripple limit.

959
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:59,590
Celebrate now.

960
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,300
They're just going to kick it upstairs. 
(Cell Phone Ringing)

961
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,500
It's Donaldson.

962
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,440
He has no idea what he's up against.

963
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:51,830
(Exhaling Heavily)

964
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,380
Let's take a walk.

965
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:07,660
The intense chemistry between them,

966
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,620
...the constant inflection points,

967
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,210
...and the kicker,
you pulling them apart twice

968
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,710
...only to have chance
put them back together.

969
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,630
Yeah, all that seemed a little much.

970
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:21,430
So, I asked Burdensky to do some 
research this morning.

971
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,750
Have you been in here before?

972
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,040
No, of course not.

973
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,520
It seems like David Norris
and Elise Sellas

974
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,600
were meant to be together

975
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,720
because they were meant to be together.

976
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:34,190
Wait, what?

977
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,150
[Donaldson]
In the '70s when he was born,

978
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,570
...they were meant to be together,

979
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:39,890
...same thing in the '80s, '90s.

980
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:42,660
Wasn't till 2005 that the plan changed

981
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,940
and she was supposed to stay with Adrian.

982
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:54,960
The problem here is there are remnants 
from all those old plans

983
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,500
...that keep pushing them together.

984
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,800
They still feel like they belong with 
each other even though they don't,

985
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,320
...and we're about to tear
them apart again.

986
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,680
You spend your whole career

987
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,820
...hoping, someday,
you'll get a red-letter case.

988
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:27,410
Something you can really make a name 
for yourself with.

989
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:29,010
Finally you get one,

990
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,420
...and it's booby-trapped.

991
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:31,940
What?

992
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:35,510
I'm saying, it wasn't your fault.

993
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,790
They were meant to be together.

994
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,190
What?

995
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,550
Were. In an earlier version of the plan.

996
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:45,350
Actually, a dozen earlier versions.

997
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,350
I always wondered how
we had such bad luck

998
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:54,310
...that she was on that particular bus
on that particular day.

999
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,730
How could a plan just change like that?

1000
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:57,770
I don't know.

1001
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,650
It's above my pay grade.

1002
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,400
So, we're going operational.

1003
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,030
This is exciting. It's been a while.

1004
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,270
We're not going operational.

1005
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:13,500
No one ever made it to my
job by taking stupid risks.

1006
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,870
So, what are we going to do?

1007
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:16,790
We're going to kick this case upstairs

1008
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,880
...to someone with the latitude
to clean up this mess

1009
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,550
...without breaking into a sweat.

1010
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,710
We're going to bring this to Thompson.

1011
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:24,430
Thompson?

1012
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,840
When he was in the field,
his nickname was...

1013
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,280
"The Hammer," yes.

1014
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:32,970
He'll crush this little romance with a 
flick of his hand

1015
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,640
...and force them back on plan again.

1016
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,480
I want to go to a club.

1017
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,850
Oh! Why ruin a really nice day?

1018
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,690
- Come on.
- No, I don't dance.

1019
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:43,690
Everyone can dance.
You just feel the music.

1020
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,490
Well, I've been told that I have 
trouble feeling.

1021
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:47,930
Who told you that?

1022
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,710
A long list of women.

1023
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,070
That's gross.

1024
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,400
You know what?

1025
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,980
Let's race to that lamppost.

1026
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,160
You win, I dance for you.

1027
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,960
I win, you dance for me.

1028
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:02,170
On the pole?

1029
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,210
If you like, yeah.

1030
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,050
This is serious. What are the rules?

1031
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:07,470
There are no rules.

1032
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,790
Oh! You bastard! Oh, my gosh!

1033
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,500
(Both Laughing)

1034
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,220
You challenged me in those shoes?

1035
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,820
Okay, fine. I can't.

1036
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:18,520
You're right. These are the wrong shoes.
I'm going to twist an ankle.

1037
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,690
- You said, "No rules."
- I avoided them.

1038
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:20,930
Ow!

1039
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,500
You said you had trouble feeling.

1040
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:28,130
Great.

1041
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:36,330
Hey, David.

1042
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,120
You're even cuter in person.

1043
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,750
[Man]
Hey, it's David Norris.

1044
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,910
How you doing? How are you?

1045
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,420
[Elise]
How are we feeling about this tie?

1046
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,590
[Man #2]
Hey, David Norris!

1047
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:47,010
[David]
Hey, how you doing?

1048
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,630
Maybe I should go home and get my tux.

1049
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:51,180
Definitely don't do that. It's good.

1050
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:56,620
I should never have come back here 
again without my backup dancers.

1051
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,810
I voted for you.

1052
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:00,770
How are you?

1053
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,850
(People Cheering)

1054
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,410
[Man #3]
Norris, you're a rock star!

1055
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,460
Did you grow up over here?

1056
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,170
Yeah, three blocks over that way. 
Pioneer Street.

1057
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:26,460
My whole childhood.

1058
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,700
What were you like as a kid?

1059
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:32,010
I've spent about half my time in the 
Principal's office

1060
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,260
...up until the sixth grade.

1061
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:33,580
Wow.

1062
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,430
Yeah, that was when my mother and my 
brother died

1063
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:38,890
...within a month of each other.

1064
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:39,690
I'm sorry.

1065
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,100
No, it's fine.

1066
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,190
You know how I always tell that story

1067
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,900
...about how I got inspired
to go into politics

1068
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,110
...because my dad took me
to the Senate Gallery

1069
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:50,990
...and we sat together and that's true.

1070
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,990
But what I leave out is

1071
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,490
...he did that right after they died.

1072
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:57,410
And I was bottoming out.

1073
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:02,500
So, he wanted to get me out of here
for a little while

1074
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,380
...and he planned this road trip to DC,

1075
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,820
...and I think it's because
JFK was his idol.

1076
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,840
And we went and sat in the gallery.

1077
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,640
I remember watching him watch them,

1078
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:18,900
...and I knew that that's
what I wanted to do.

1079
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:23,180
I wish they were here to see all this.

1080
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,000
I was...

1081
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:34,820
Didn't expect to tell you any of that.

1082
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:49,920
David?

1083
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:53,170
David?

1084
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,920
(Cell Phone Buzzing)

1085
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:02,790
- Hello?
- It's Adrian.

1086
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:04,860
Hey.

1087
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,740
(Door Opening)

1088
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,950
What are you doing? Why are you calling?

1089
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,200
Hi.

1090
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,210
No, I was...

1091
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:17,550
Because I was sleeping.

1092
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:19,500
No.

1093
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,840
No, it's not.

1094
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:24,070
Why are you calling?

1095
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:29,230
Okay, well, I got to go.

1096
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,240
No, I got to go. Okay.

1097
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,480
I'm so sorry.

1098
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:37,860
It's all right. Everything okay?

1099
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,260
Yeah.

1100
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,870
Oh, my God. That was so weird.

1101
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,350
I woke up and you weren't here.

1102
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,660
And then the phone rang and it was my ex

1103
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,900
...which is just so strange.

1104
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,380
Sorry, I guess we hadn't gotten
to any of that stuff yet.

1105
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:52,860
Right.

1106
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,220
You know, we broke up a while ago,

1107
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:01,140
...and it's over and then
he calls four times in one morning.

1108
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,470
He called you four times this morning?

1109
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:05,110
Mmm-hmm.

1110
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,980
How long have you guys been broken up?

1111
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:10,380
Um...

1112
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,310
Three months.

1113
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:17,130
It's like he knew
I was with someone else.

1114
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,020
Was it serious?

1115
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,310
We were engaged.

1116
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,370
So, not really that serious?

1117
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:27,570
(Laughs)
Right.

1118
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:29,970
Well, what happened?

1119
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,120
(Exhales Heavily)

1120
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,540
Do you want to know this?

1121
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:33,940
Yeah.

1122
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,070
He was a great guy.

1123
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,600
Brilliant choreographer and dancer,

1124
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,970
...and we had the same group of friends.

1125
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,850
We had known each other a long time.

1126
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:55,530
Well, he sounds great.
Why didn't you marry him?

1127
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,560
Because of you.

1128
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:07,580
I'm not some hopeless romantic.

1129
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:10,860
I've never allowed myself to be that way.

1130
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:12,690
But once I felt,

1131
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,280
...even for a moment,
what I felt with you.

1132
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,760
You ruined me.
I didn't want to settle for less.

1133
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:26,030
I know the feeling.

1134
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:28,750
It scares the shit out of me.

1135
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,180
I'm not going to hurt you.

1136
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:34,100
You don't need to say that.

1137
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,180
I'm not going to hurt you.

1138
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,790
This is the first time

1139
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:46,810
...in 25 years that I don't
feel like I'm by myself.

1140
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:49,080
(Exhales)
That's a lot of responsibility for me.

1141
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,920
I don't know if I'm quite
comfortable with that.

1142
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,700
Well, too late.

1143
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:05,230
You know, I'm supposed to go to an 
interview right now.

1144
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:10,970
What if I told you I wasn't ready to 
let you out of my sight quite yet?

1145
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,810
- Sounds good.
- You want to go?

1146
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,410
- Yeah.
- All right.

1147
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:14,980
Are you handsome

1148
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,260
Are you handsome

1149
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:21,490
...or is it that Washington is so 
populated by

1150
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:25,380
I don't want to say,
hideous abnormalities...

1151
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:26,820
[David]
This is getting a little weird.

1152
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,570
(Studio Audience Laughing)

1153
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:30,370
David Norris, everybody.

1154
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:31,170
(Cheering)

1155
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,670
- [Man] Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

1156
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:40,880
Congressman Norris asked me
to give you a message.

1157
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,000
He was just called into a meeting.

1158
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,510
- He says it's urgent.
- Okay.

1159
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,090
He said he'll call you
as soon as he's out

1160
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,510
...and he'll see you at the show tonight.

1161
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,430
Okay, thank you. Thanks.

1162
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,950
This way, Congressman.

1163
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:14,180
Hello?

1164
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,300
Frustrating, isn't it?

1165
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:25,730
My name is Thompson.

1166
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:30,050
Whatever happened to free will?

1167
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:32,850
We actually tried free will before.

1168
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,470
After taking you from
hunting and gathering

1169
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:37,060
...to the height of the Roman Empire,

1170
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:41,460
...we stepped back to see how
you would do on your own.

1171
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:46,460
You gave us the Dark Ages
for five centuries

1172
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,910
...until finally we decided
we should come back in.

1173
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:53,740
The Chairman thought that maybe we
just needed to do a better job

1174
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,910
...with teaching you how to ride a bike

1175
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:58,580
...before taking the
training wheels off again.

1176
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,960
So, we gave you the Renaissance,

1177
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,590
...the Enlightenment,
scientific revolution.

1178
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,250
For 600 years we taught you

1179
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,760
...to control your impulses with reason.

1180
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,640
Then in 1910, we stepped back again.

1181
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:16,100
Within 50 years,
you had brought us World War I,

1182
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,960
...the Depression, Fascism, the Holocaust,

1183
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:23,400
...and capped it off by
bringing the entire planet

1184
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,900
to the brink of destruction

1185
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,690
...in the Cuban missile crisis.

1186
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:29,570
At that point a decision was taken to 
step back in again

1187
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:33,890
...before you did something
that even we couldn't fix.

1188
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,680
You don't have free will, David.

1189
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:41,580
You have the appearance of free will.

1190
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,920
You expect me to believe that?

1191
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,210
I make decisions every day.

1192
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,630
You have free will over which 
toothpaste you use

1193
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:49,630
...or which beverage to order at lunch.

1194
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:52,590
But humanity just isn't mature enough

1195
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:54,840
...to control the important things.

1196
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,180
So, you handle the important things?

1197
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,680
The last time I checked,
the world is a pretty screwed-up place.

1198
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,960
It's still here.

1199
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,770
If we had left things in your hands,
it wouldn't be.

1200
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:07,490
Tell me why I can't be with Elise?

1201
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:09,230
Because the last guy didn't know.

1202
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:12,990
Meeting Elise at the Waldorf three 
years ago wasn't chance.

1203
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:13,950
That was us.

1204
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:17,530
We knew she would inspire you
to give that speech.

1205
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:20,830
That speech that brought you back from 
the edge of oblivion

1206
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:24,710
...and overnight made you the
front-runner in this coming election.

1207
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:26,790
What are you saying? You want me to win 
the election?

1208
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:29,350
This one and four more after it.

1209
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:35,080
And I'm not just talking about 
elections for Senate.

1210
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:38,350
You can matter, David. Really matter.

1211
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:41,890
What your father wanted when he took 
you to the Senate Gallery

1212
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:43,250
...when you were 10.

1213
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,100
What your brother wanted when he made 
you promise

1214
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,940
...the day before he overdosed

1215
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,070
...that you wouldn't be like him.

1216
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:55,350
Why do you think you have that yearning 
to be in front of people?

1217
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:59,410
That terrible emptiness when you're not.

1218
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:00,530
Don't do that.

1219
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:03,470
David, you can change the world,

1220
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:06,920
...but that doesn't happen
if you stay with her.

1221
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,210
Why do you people care who I love?

1222
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:12,010
It's not about her, it's about you.

1223
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,820
What being with her does to you.

1224
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,550
What it does to me?

1225
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:17,840
I'm better when I'm with her!

1226
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,720
Even you said it. The speech.

1227
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,520
In small doses, Elise was the cure.

1228
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:24,410
But in large doses,

1229
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,020
...she rubs off on you.

1230
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:26,420
Stop.

1231
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:30,740
David, the president can't be a loose 
cannon.

1232
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:32,610
Stop talking. It's not working.

1233
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:36,610
Why do you refuse to accept what should 
be completely obvious by now?

1234
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:38,770
You've seen what we can do.

1235
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:42,270
You can't doubt we are who we say we 
are.

1236
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:49,270
Look, it's not about who you are, it's 
about who I am.

1237
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:52,590
Can't outrun your fate, David.

1238
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:56,430
I just disagree with you about what my 
fate is.

1239
01:06:56,930 --> 01:07:01,490
I know what I feel for her and it's not 
going to change.

1240
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,260
All I have are the choices that I make.

1241
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:08,050
And I choose her

1242
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,310
...come what may.

1243
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:16,580
It's 6:20.

1244
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:21,550
If you leave now,
you can make Elise's show.

[ Slow Music Playing ]

1248
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:34,350
She's a beautiful dancer.

1249
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,720
I thought I made myself clear.

1250
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,360
There is one more piece to this I 
haven't mentioned.

1251
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:46,320
I guess I just didn't have the heart.

1252
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,720
If you stay with her,

1253
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:55,710
...it not only kills your
dreams, it kills hers.

1254
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:57,450
What?

1255
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:03,180
Elise is about to become one of the 
most famous dancers in the country

1256
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:06,890
...and eventually one of
the world's greatest choreographers.

1257
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:08,650
If she stays with you,

1258
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:12,690
...she ends up teaching
dance to six-year-olds.

1259
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,790
When you look back at all this, David,

1260
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:31,070
...just remember

1261
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,520
...we tried to reason with you.

(Machinery Whirring)

1265
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:49,190
I always hear people saying,

1266
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:54,450
"You can't blame yourself
for what happens to other people,"

1267
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,410
...but in this case, really, you can.

1268
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:08,510
This is what you do, David.

1269
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:11,050
This is what you did
getting into a bar fight

1270
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:13,010
...the night you first got elected.

1271
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:17,020
What you did to get that embarrassing 
photo in The New York Post.

We give you opportunities other people 
would kill for

1273
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:23,770
...and you squander them with impulse.

1274
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,990
It doesn't take a genius to see Elise

1275
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:30,190
...isn't exactly helping you with this.

1276
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:33,250
It's a sprain, David,

1277
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,790
...but if you stay with her,

1278
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:38,500
you'll take away the only thing she 
ever cared about.

1279
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,700
It's up to you.

1280
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:00,650
It's just a sprain.

1281
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:01,730
It's just a sprain.

1282
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:02,130
Yeah.

1283
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:05,820
The doctor said it's going to be better 
in a month or less.

1284
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,900
That's totally unexpected.

1285
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:10,410
(Sighing)
I'm so relieved.

1286
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:11,450
Great. Great.

1287
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:15,150
You're such a great dancer,

1288
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:20,980
...and you'll heal up
and just get better and better.

1289
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:33,090
I'm going to go make a couple phone calls.

1290
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:33,490
Okay.

1291
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:37,920
Okay.

1292
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,820
I'm so happy for you.

[Richardson]
It's done. Thompson finished it.

1294
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,160
I know.

1295
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,050
You can't let it get to you

1296
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:26,690
...like it did with his family.

1297
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:27,970
This is the job.

1298
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:39,290
[Harry]
You ever wonder

1299
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:41,690
...if it's right?

1300
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:43,390
I mean,

1301
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:47,170
...if it's always right?

1302
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,810
[Richardson]
Not like I used to.

1303
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:54,680
Look, Chairman has the plan.

1304
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,520
We only see part of it.

1305
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:25,040
I was talking to some friends of ours 
over in Monroe County this morning,

1306
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,170
...and I said something
to them that I think

1307
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:30,380
...a lot of you may have heard me say
before but it bears repeating.

1308

David Norris, who has spent the last 
two days campaigning in the Tri-Lakes 
area

1309
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:38,010
...received some welcome news yesterday
when the latest New York Times poll

1310
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:40,470
...gave him a 16-point
lead over his opponent

1311
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:43,140
...less than a month before election day.

1312
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:45,310
Since his announcement 11 months ago,

1313
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:47,600
Norris has had a significant lead...

1314
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,600
Hi. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

1315
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:52,360
Yeah, thank you. I need it. Thank you.

1316
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,610
- Who should I make it out to?
- My nephew, Miles.

1317
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:56,200
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.

1318
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

1319
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,660
- [Man] Thank you.
- My pleasure. Pleasure.

1320
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,740
[Man #2]
Can we get a picture with you?

1321
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:04,500

Sure, come on.

1322
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,380
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1323
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,320
Hey.

1324
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,670
I want to show you this,
because you would find out eventually.

1325
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:17,070
I want to be here when you do.

1326
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:24,660
She's getting married to that guy she 
was engaged to.

1327
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:27,740
You okay?

1328
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,440
I think I'm going to...

1329
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,640
Take a day off.

1330
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:36,180
Hell, take a couple. We're 16 points up.

1331
01:15:36,530 --> 01:15:39,730
Yeah, even I can't blow a lead that big.

1332
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:50,430
[Bartender]
Congressman, good to see you again.

1333
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:51,850
Your friend just left you this.

1334
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:54,490
He said you would be stopping by.

1335
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,950
Why would you want to see me?

1336
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,300
Thompson was lying when he said

1337
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:24,680
you couldn't be with Elise because she 
brings out your reckless side.

1338
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,480
Then why? Why do they care so much?

1339
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,300
Because she's enough, David.

1340
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,810
If you have her,

1341
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:35,060
...you won't need to fill
that void inside of you

1342
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,140
...with applause and votes

1343
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:40,860
...and dreams of one day
making it to the White House.

1344
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:45,660
That's important, but it's not the only 
thing that matters.

1345
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:48,620
Why are you so different from them?

1346
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:57,390
Your dad

1347
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,670
...was a very smart man.

1348
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,440
He could have been a lot more.
Wanted to be.

1349
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:10,450
Your brother, too.

1350
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,080
But the plan didn't call for it.

1351
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,600
What about my mother?

1352
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,800
That wasn't me.

1353
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,240
That wasn't us at all.

1354
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,420
It was just chance?

1355
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:26,750
I'm sorry.

1356
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:34,140
You know, Thompson is not lying.

1357
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:38,790
They're already talking about me being 
a presidential candidate.

1358
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:41,590
I'm phoning in my speeches and I'm 16 
points up.

1359
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:43,270
The public loves you.

1360
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:47,400
Before I met Elise,
that's all I cared about.

1361
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:50,710
I don't even notice it now.

1362
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:58,870
I can't stop thinking about her.

1363
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:09,190
Do you know where she's getting married?

1364
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:12,990
In front of a judge tomorrow morning.

1365
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:14,910
Is she happy?

1366
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,630
Thompson won't let you anywhere near her.

1367
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:23,170
Not tonight, not tomorrow, not ever.

1368
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:23,650
Harry.

1369
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,010
Is she happy?

1370
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,190
(Sighs)

1371
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:33,370
I got to try and get her back.

1372
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:37,100
Will you help me?
Will you just help me get to her?

1373
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:40,060
They'll sense you coming a mile away.

1374
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,980
What if I could move as fast as you?

1375
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:45,860
Teach me about the doors.

1376
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:49,610
[Harry]
The rain will stop in the next hour,

1377
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:52,370
...and that's the only thing keeping
them from seeing us right now.

1378
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:55,160
If we're going to do this, we'll need 
all night to do it

1379
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:59,000
... and a place surrounded
by water to do it in.

1380
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,840
Always turn the doorknob clockwise.

1381
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:04,040
What happens if I turn it the other way?

1382
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:07,720
You don't want to do that.
That's only for us.

1383
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,840
Put your hand on my shoulder

1384
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,640
...and don't let go
until we cross the threshold.

1385
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,890
Are these ever locked?

1386
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:17,090
Not when you're wearing one of our hats.

1387
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,420
Keep moving, David.

1388
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:28,740
Is this...

1389
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,160
It's the Museum of Modern Art.

1390
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:31,560
Yeah.

1391
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:44,530
Close the door.

1392
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:56,100
This is the city's main pumping station 
for downtown Manhattan.

1393
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,980
We're 10 blocks from the courthouse.

1394
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,200
Wait here.

1395
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:24,970
Hi, is the floor open?

1396
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,090
You okay, sweetie?

1397
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:29,290
Yeah, I just...

1398
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:33,930
I just feel like being on the floor.

1399
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:44,440
Lower Manhattan is layer upon
layer of substrate.

1400
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:47,440
That's what we call the doors that have 
been added over time.

1401
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:51,900
Makes it a lot more complex to navigate 
downtown than it is uptown

1402
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,400
...and a lot slower.

1403
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:57,480
Your destination, 60 Center Street, 
Courtroom 300.

1404
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:04,830
There are thousands of different ways

1405
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:07,290
...to get to the courthouse
using the doors.

1406
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:09,630
I want you to learn how to stay in the 
substrate

1407
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:12,460
...so Thompson won't be able
to get a fix on you.

1408
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:15,380
[David] Okay. Just south of the diner, 
it's a red door.

1409
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:17,890
I come out on Broadway,
right by Leonard Street.

1410
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:19,810
That's good. Keep going.

1411
01:22:19,930 --> 01:22:22,270
From Leonard, half a block down.

1412
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:23,980
Okay, suppose Thompson's there?

1413
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,300
Okay, I go east to Lafayette.

1414
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,310
No, it's Crosby Street there.

1415
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:30,360
Eight doors?
I'm zigzagging all over the place.

1416
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,530
That will take me too long.

1417
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,030
But every time you go through a door,

1418
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:36,110
...their plan books will lose
track of you, so it's safer.

1419
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:39,370
[Harry] Look, I need you to understand 
this has never been done before.

1420
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:42,870
So, the minute you go through that 
first door, all hell will break loose.

1421
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:45,790
Assume everyone with a hat on is a threat.

1422
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:47,250
I don't care if it's a Yankee cap,

1423
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:49,130
...a bowler, or even a yarmulke.

1424
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:52,050
Assume everyone in a hat
is working with Thompson.

1425
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,840
Even you guys can't get through the 
doors without your hats on, right?

1426
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:55,320
Right.

1427
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:58,510
It's one of the ways the Chairman 
limits our power.

1428
01:22:58,510 --> 01:22:59,760
Water is another way.

1429
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,350
And you said before, what if Thompson's 
in front of me on Crosby Street?

1430
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:02,830
Right.

1431
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:05,430
Why don't I just knock
the hat off his head

1432
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:07,900
...and then run by him before
he has time to pick it up?

1433
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,810
That's good, improvisation.
We have trouble with that.

1434
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:13,570
[David] The fastest way is actually if I 
go right for the blue door.

1435
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:15,570
Yeah, but then you're exposed the 
entire way there.

1436
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:17,820
That's a lot more dangerous than 
leapfrogging through doors.

1437
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,910
But if I make it, I'll take them 
completely by surprise.

1438
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:21,110
If you make it.

1439
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:29,040
Come on, we have
a lot more to get through.

1440
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,480
Whatever it takes.

1441
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:35,780
Your father used to say that.

1442
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:46,270
I guess you're not supposed to identify 
with your subjects.

1443
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:48,560
You're not supposed to feel guilt.

1444
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,730
We're not built to lead with our 
emotions like you are,

1445
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:55,250
...but that doesn't mean we
don't have them.

1446
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:58,700
Some more than others.

1447
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:17,830
(Rain Pattering)

1448
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,550
You're lucky, it started raining again.

1449
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:25,600
We need to get going.
The wedding is in 10 minutes.

1450
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:30,080
We have time. Being early is just as 
bad as being late.

1451
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:33,520
Is your fiance here?

1452
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,120
She's on her way in.

1453
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:37,310
Courtroom 300.

1454
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,840
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1455
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,880
- This is it.
- Okay.

1456
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:55,000
I'm going to go for the blue door.

1457
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:55,800
Of course.

1458
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:01,740
Here is your way through it.
Don't lose it.

1459
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:04,210
Thanks, Harry.

1460
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:05,270
Good luck.

1461
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:12,040
Okay.

1462
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:34,460
It looks like Mr. Norris is using the 
rain to make a run for it.

1463
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:37,020
Call the proctor at the wedding.

1464
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,470
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm just nervous, I guess.

1465
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:44,990
I just need a minute in the bathroom, 
okay?

1466
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:08,240
Sir, he's got a hat.
He's in the substrate.

1467
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,800
He just went into the substrate.

1468
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:29,430
- Whoa, whoa.
- No, no, no.

1469
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:31,430
It's an emergency. Sorry.

1470
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:34,270
Docket number 22, please come forward.

1471
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:35,810
We're next. Will you go check on her?

1472
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:36,210
Yeah.

1473
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:47,360
You're David Norris! Yeah, I got to go.

1474
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:51,200
Nothing in the hat.

1475
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,440
[Security Officer]
Go ahead.

1476
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:09,930
She's not even in there.

1477
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:12,510
Where is she? Where is she?

1478
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:15,620
Elise.

1479
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:20,310
You're not marrying that guy.

1480
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:21,030
(Panting)

1481
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:24,150
I'm so sorry,

1482
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:27,570
...and I don't know what you must think
of me, but you can't marry him.

1483
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:29,780
You don't love him. I've been terrible, 
I know.

1484
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:31,830
- I'm getting married.
- No, you can't. 

1485
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:34,160
Don't touch me! What are you doing?

1486
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,870
Do you know that no one has ever hurt 
me as much as you did?

1487
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:38,670
I'm so sorry that I left you the way 
that I did.

1488
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:41,420
David, you know what?
You left me in a fucking hospital.

1489
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:42,590
What are you doing?

1490
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,760
I know it seems terrible but there was 
a reason.

1491
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,470
You don't know anything about me

1492
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,720
...and what makes me happy.

1493
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,800
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

1494
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,520
Oh, my God.

1495
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,720
Don't worry about him, he's with them.

1496
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:56,770
- Just listen to me.
- Oh, my God, what did you do?

1497
01:27:56,770 --> 01:27:59,230
- Forget about him.
- What are you doing?

1498
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:02,110
Look at me, I know that you love me.

1499
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:08,630
Okay, this says that you love me

1500
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:12,280
...and that I love you and that
we're not supposed to be together.

1501
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,530
Because of this book.

1502
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:15,330
But I know that I'm supposed
to be with you

1503
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:16,580
...because of the way I feel.

1504
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:18,460
I love you and I don't care what happens.

1505
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:23,130
I want to spend the rest of my life with
you even if it's only a little while.
while.

1506
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:24,730
He just revealed us.

1507
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:26,880
Call the Intervention Team.

1508
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,600
Tell them it's a square-one reset.

1509
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:38,390
Mr. Thompson has deployed
the Intervention Team.

1510
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:40,770
He's requesting an emergency
Reset Authorization.

1511
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:42,130
I'll carry it in.

1512
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,120
(Panting)

1513
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:52,610
Why are they chasing you?

1514
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:56,410
They're going to reset me.

1515
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:58,570
What are you talking about?

1516
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:00,660
I never lied to you.

1517
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:01,940
[Man]
Down here.

1518
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:03,780
He's down here.

1519
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:06,190
I love you, Elise.

1520
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:10,590
I'm going to show you something.

1521
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,190
You deserve to know.

1522
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,160
What's going on?

1523
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,600
We got to keep moving.
There is another door here.

1524
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:57,810
Got them. Sixth Avenue.

1525
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:00,470
Contain this.

1526
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,940
Oh, my God. What's happening to me?

1527
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:07,150
All you need to know,
we're being chased.

1528
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:08,990
I need you to trust me.

1529
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,980
I need you to trust me.

1530
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:12,900
- Okay.
- Okay, come on.

1531
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:25,150
Door, door, door!

1532
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,590
Find another door!

1533
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:30,150
(Gasps)

1534
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:36,010
What the hell is going on?

1535
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:37,760
What the hell is going on, David?

1536
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:38,890
Okay, I'm sorry.

1537
01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:40,180
How did we just do that?

1538
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:41,220
I'm so sorry.

1539
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:44,180
These doors belong to the people who 
are chasing us.

1540
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:46,310
- Who are they?
- I don't know what to call them,

1541
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:47,980
but they want to take you away from me.

1542
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:49,770
Why do they care about us?

1543
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:51,400
They hurt your ankle, Elise.

1544
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,280
Everything you've worked for your 
entire life,

1545
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,200
it doesn't happen if you stay with me.

1546
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,910
That's why I left you in the hospital.

1547
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,430
I don't understand.

1548
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,140
I don't understand.

1549
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:04,180
This can't be wrong.

1550
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:07,470
This can't be wrong.

1551
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,860
Why do they think it's wrong?

1552
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,800
The book... Their book.

1553
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:17,890
But what if I can find who wrote it?

1554
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,760
Okay, I can go through this door alone.

1555
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:31,180
You'll never see me or the people 
chasing us again.

1556
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:37,150
Or you could come with me, and
I don't know what's on the other side,

1557
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:38,530
...but I know you would be next to me,

1558
01:31:38,530 --> 01:31:43,090
...and that's all I've wanted
since the minute I met you.

1559
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:54,020
I'm coming with you.

1560
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:58,370
Okay.

1561
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:03,950
Take the other one.

1562
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:05,990
Turn it to the left.

1563
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:07,020
To the left.

1564
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:17,700
Oh, my God.

1565
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:28,640
(Sighs)

1566
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:39,380
[Man]
Hey! You can't be in here.

1567
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:40,900
[Man #2]
Stop, sir!

1568
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:43,140
[Man #3]
Hold them up!

1569
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:45,650
Come on.

1570
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,000
[Man #4]
Stop them!

1571
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:18,090
Harry Mitchell, they want you in the 
Chairman's office.

1572
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:19,050
Immediately.

1573
01:33:39,690 --> 01:33:40,330
Come on.

1574
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,220
Hey! Hey!

1575
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,920
How did you get in here?

1576
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:17,340
Search the room!

1577
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:35,110
Shit!

1578
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:37,560
Go back.

1579
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:03,560
No.

1580
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:06,580
Oh, my God.

1581
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:15,700
- I love you.
- I love you.

1582
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:04,670
Did you really think you could reach 
the Chairman?

1583
01:36:04,670 --> 01:36:06,550
And change your fate if you did?

1584
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:07,990
Or write your own?

1585
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:12,690
It doesn't work like that and I told 
you why.

1586
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,840
I've got a message for you.

1587
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:27,730
I understand.

1588
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,040
Even Thompson has a boss.

1589
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:41,150
Harry?

1590
01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:45,880
You're the Chairman?

1591
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:46,840
(Laughs)
No.

1592
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:50,410
You've met him though, or her.

1593
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:51,750
Everybody has.

1594
01:36:53,010 --> 01:36:55,510
The Chairman comes in a different form 
to everyone

1595
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:59,030
...so people rarely realize
when it happens.

1596
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:03,310
Is this some sort of test?

1597
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,640
In a way, it's all a test,

1598
01:37:07,610 --> 01:37:12,410
...for everybody, even the members
of the Adjustment Bureau.

1599
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:15,530
David, you risked everything for Elise.

1600
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:18,620
And Elise, when you came through that 
door at the Statue of Liberty,

1601
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:21,020
...you risked everything, too.

1602
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:22,810
But you inspired me.

1603
01:37:23,290 --> 01:37:26,890
It seems like you
inspired the Chairman, too.

1604
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:30,200
Is that about us?

1605
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:30,580
Yes.

1606
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:34,760
What does it say?

1607
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:37,100
It says that this situation
between the two of you

1608
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:40,300
...is a serious deviation from the plan.

1609
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,340
So, the Chairman rewrote it.

1610
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:53,890
Okay.

1611
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:56,500
Now what?

1612
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:58,010
Now...

1613
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,500
You can take the stairs.

1614
01:38:17,970 --> 01:38:21,600
[Harry] Most people live life on the 
path we set for them.

1615
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,160
Too afraid to explore any other.

1616
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:27,610
But once in a while, people like you 
come along

1617
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:31,780
...who knock down all the obstacles
we put in your way.

1618
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:35,660
People who realize free will is a gift 
you'll never know how to use

1619
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:37,740
...until you fight for it.

1620
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:41,200
I think that's the Chairman's real plan

1621
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,880
...that maybe one day

1622
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,320
...we won't write the plan.

1623
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:47,890
You will.
