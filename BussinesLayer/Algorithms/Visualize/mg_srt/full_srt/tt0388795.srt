00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,724
You pair of deuces
looking for work,

3
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,186
l suggest you get your scrawny asses in here pronto.

4
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:48,787
U p on Brokeback,
the Forest Service has got designated campsites

5
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,372
on the allotments.

6
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:54,418
Them camps can be 3,
4 miles from where we pasture the woollies.

7
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,963
Bad predator loss if there's nobody
looking after them at night.

8
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,717
Now, what l want
is a camp tender

9
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,096
to stay in the main camp,
where the Forest Service says.

10
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,889
But the herder,

11
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,892
he's gonna pitch a pup tent on the QT with the sheep

12
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,061
and he's gonna sleep there.

13
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,897
You eat your supper
and breakfast in camp,

14
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,984
but you sleep
with the sheep 100 %.

15
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,154
No fire,
don't leave no sign.

16
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,531
You roll up that
tent every morning

17
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,866
in case Forest
Service snoops around.

18
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,369
Yeah?

19
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,414
No.

20
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,667
No!

21
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,921
Not on your fucking life.

22
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,803
You got your dogs, your
. 30-30, you sleep there.

23
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:51,600
Last summer l had goddamn near 25 % loss.
l don't want that again.

24
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,101
You.

25
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,981
Fridays at noon,
be down at the bridge

26
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,150
with your
grocery list and mules,

27
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,945
and somebody with supplies
will be there at the pick-up.

28
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,202
Tomorrow morning we'll truck you up to the jump-off.

29
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,940
Jack Twist.

30
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,233
Ennis.

31
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,361
Your folks
just stop at Ennis?

32
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,488
Del Mar.

33
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,491
Well, nice to know you,
Ennis Del Mar.

34
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,178
My second year up here.

35
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,641
Last year, one storm,
the lightning killed 42 sheep.

36
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,812
Thought l'd asphyxiate from the smell.

37
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:23,191
Aguirre got all over my ass,
like l was supposed to control the weather.

38
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,819
But beats working for my old man.

39
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,863
Can't please my
old man, no way.

40
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,700
That's why l
took to rodeoing.

41
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,535
You ever rodeo?

42
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,289
You know,
l mean, once in a while.

43
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,375
When l got the
entry fee in my pocket.

44
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,543
Yeah.

45
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,046
Are you from
ranch people?

46
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,048
Yeah, l was.

47
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,385
Your folks
run you off?

48
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,263
No, they run
themselves off.

49
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:58,768
There was one curve in the road in 43 miles,
and they miss it.

50
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,315
So the bank
took the ranch

51
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,485
and my brother and sister,
they raised me, mostly.

52
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,490
Shit, that's hard.

53
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,997
Can l? Thank you.

54
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,769
Don't let them stray.

55
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,479
Joe will have
your ass if you do.

56
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,190
Only thing,
don't never order soup.

57
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,193
Them soup boxes
are hard to pack.

58
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,320
Well, l don't eat soup.

59
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,454
You wanna watch it there.
That horse has a low startle point.

60
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,958
Doubt there's a filly that could throw me.

61
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,753
Let's git,
unless you wanna sit around tying knots all day.

62
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,876
Oh, shit.

63
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,378
Can't wait till l
get my own spread

64
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,715
and l won't have to put up with
Joe Aguirre's crap no more.

65
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,676
l'm saving for
a place myself.

66
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,847
Alma and me,
we're gonna get married

67
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,974
when l come down
off this mountain.

68
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,185
Shit, that stay with the sheep,
no fire bullshit.

69
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,816
Aguirre got no right making us
do something against the rules.

70
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,658
No more beans.

71
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,611
Damn. Shit!

72
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,741
l don't know.

73
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,368
Something wrong?

74
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,119
Yeah, so what...

75
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,997
Why didn't we get the powdered milk and the spuds?

76
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,166
That's all we got.

77
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,459
Well...

78
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,920
Here's next week's.

79
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,007
Thought you didn't
eat soup.

80
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,926
Yeah, well,
l'm sick of beans.

81
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,929
Too early in the summer to be sick of beans.

82
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,724
Come on.

83
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,165
Come on. Come on.

84
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,888
Hold on. Whoa, whoa.

85
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,808
Shit.

86
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,478
Whoa. Come back here!

87
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,018
Whoa there, whoa.

88
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,853
All right. Fuck it.

89
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,190
Okay, you bastard.

90
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,986
Where the hell you been?

91
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,279
Been up with
the sheep all day,

92
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,574
l get down here hungry as hell and all l find is beans.

93
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,997
What in the hell
happened, Ennis?

94
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,042
l come on a bear
is what happened.

95
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,544
Goddamn horse spooked
and the mules took off

96
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,880
and scattered
food everywhere.

97
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,882
Beans is about
all we got left.

98
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,718
Got whiskey or something?

99
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,724
Dumb-ass mule.

100
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,857
l can't believe that.
God damn.

101
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,069
Let me see.

102
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,118
Shit.

103
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,122
Well, we gotta do something about this food situation.

104
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,500
Maybe l'll shoot
one of the sheep.

105
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,752
Yeah, what if Aguirre finds out, huh?

106
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,754
We're supposed to guard the sheep,
not eat them.

107
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,299
What's the matter with you?
There are a thousand of them.

108
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,302
l'll stick with beans.

109
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,098
Well, l won't.

110
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,030
Yeah!

111
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,656
Getting tired of
your dumb-ass missing.

112
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,409
Let's get a move on.

113
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,454
Don't want the Game and Fish to catch us with no elk.

114
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,397
Come on. Shit.

115
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,240
Yeah, l'm commuting four hours a day.

116
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,911
l come in for breakfast,
l go back to the sheep.

117
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,413
Evening,
get them bedded down.

118
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,249
Come in for supper,
go back to the sheep.

119
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,670
Spend half the night
checking for damn coyotes.

120
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,799
Aguirre got no right
to make me do this.

121
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,719
You wanna switch?

122
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,887
l wouldn't mind
sleeping out there.

123
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,808
That ain't the point. The point is,
we both ought to be in this camp.

124
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,895
Goddamn pup tent smells
like cat piss or worse.

125
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,023
l wouldn't mind
being out there.

126
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,529
Well, l'm happy to switch with you,

127
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,198
but l warn you,
l can't cook worth a damn.

128
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,868
l am pretty good with
a can opener, though.

129
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,038
You can't be no
worse than me, then.

130
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,290
Here you go.

131
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,719
You won't get much sleep,
l'll tell you that.

132
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,763
Yup. Come on.

133
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,410
Shot a coyote up there.

134
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,996
lt's a big son of a bitch.

135
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,373
He had balls on him the size of apples.

136
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,002
He looked like he could eat himself a camel.

137
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,422
You want some
of this hot water?

138
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,969
lt's all yours.

139
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,496
Mmm.

140
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,093
l don't
rodeo much myself.

141
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,845
l mean,
what's the point

142
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,598
of riding some piece of
stock for eight seconds?

143
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,850
Money's a good point.

144
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,393
True enough.

145
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,939
lf you don't get
stomped winning it, huh?

146
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,106
Yeah.

147
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,986
Well, my old man,
he was a bull rider.

148
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,031
Thank you.

149
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,159
Pretty well-known in his day.

150
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,287
Though he kept his
secrets to himself.

151
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,959
Never taught me a thing,
never once come to see me ride.

152
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,390
Your brother and
sister do right by you?

153
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,352
They did the best they could after my folks was gone.

154
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:18,401
Considering they didn't leave us
nothing but $24 in a coffee can.

155
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,363
l got me
a year of high school.

156
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,325
That was before the transmission went on the pickup.

157
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,162
And then my sis left.

158
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,707
She married a roughneck,
moved to Casper.

159
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,668
And me and my brother,

160
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,255
we went and got ourselves some
work on a ranch up near Worland.

161
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,258
Till l was 19.
Then he got married.

162
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,054
And no more room for me.

163
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,894
That's how come
me end up here.

164
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,197
What?

165
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,911
Man, that's more words than you've
spoke in the past two weeks.

166
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,582
Hell, that's the most l've spoke in a year.

167
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,923
But my dad,
he was a fine roper.

168
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,301
Didn't rodeo much, though.

169
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,970
He thought rodeo cowboys was all fuck-ups.

170
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,558
The hell they are.

171
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,436
Well...

172
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,276
There you go.

173
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,238
l'm spurring his guts out!

174
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,157
Waving to the
girls in the stands!

175
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,159
He's kicking
me to high heaven,

176
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,952
but he don't
jack board me! No!

177
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,000
l think my dad was right.

178
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,256
Tent don't look right.

179
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,634
Well, it ain't going nowhere.
Let it be.

180
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,013
That harmonica don't
sound quite right either.

181
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,517
That's 'cause it got kind of flattened
when that mare threw me.

182
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,185
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

183
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,689
l thought you said that mare couldn't throw you.

184
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,274
She got lucky.

185
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,487
Yeah, well, if l got lucky,
that harmonica would've broke in two.

186
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,953
I know I shaII meet
you on that final day

187
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:20,583
Water-walking Jesus,
take me away!

188
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,503
Very good.

189
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,963
Oh, yeah.

190
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:29,133
My mama,
she believes in the Pentecost.

191
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,468
Oh, yeah?

192
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,597
What exactly
is the Pentecost?

193
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,433
l mean, my folks,
they was Methodist.

194
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,603
The Pentecost.

195
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,189
l don't know,
l don't know what the Pentecost is.

196
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,149
Mom never
explained it to me.

197
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,818
l guess it's
when the world ends

198
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,946
and fellas like you and me,
we march off to hell.

199
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,741
Speak for yourself.

200
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:57,328
You may be a sinner,
but l ain't yet had the opportunity.

201
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,248
Thank you.

202
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,586
Shit!

203
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,757
l'm gonna go up
to the sheep now.

204
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,425
Give them hell.

205
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,849
No, l'm...

206
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,603
You can hardly stand.

207
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,772
lt's too late to
go to them sheep.

208
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,486
Well, you got
an extra blanket?

209
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:34,448
l'll just roll up
out here, grab 40 winks

210
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,284
and l'll ride
out at first light.

211
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,999
You'll freeze your ass off when that fire dies down.

212
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,376
Oh, that's good.

213
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,419
You're better off
sleeping in the tent.

214
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,587
Yeah.

215
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,590
All right.

216
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,169
Ennis!

217
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:30,879
What?

218
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,674
Just quit your yammering and get in here!

219
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,154
Come on, come on.

220
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,123
What are you doing?

221
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,877
See you for supper.

222
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,755
Yeah. Come on.

223
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,086
Come on.

224
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,049
This is a one-shot thing we got going on here.

225
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,681
lt's nobody's
business but ours.

226
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,101
You know l ain't queer.

227
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,812
Me, neither.

228
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,722
l'm sorry.

229
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:43,103
lt's all right.

230
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,272
Lie back. Come on.

231
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,753
Twist.

232
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:53,006
Your Uncle Harold's in the hospital with pneumonia.

233
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,050
Docs don't expect
he'll make it.

234
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,387
Your ma sent me to
tell you, so here l am.

235
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,809
Bad news.

236
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,313
There ain't nothing l can
do about it up here, l guess.

237
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,942
There's not much you can do
about it down there, neither.

238
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,822
Not unless
you can cure pneumonia.

239
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,440
God damn! Jesus!

240
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,402
Them sheep will drift if l don't get back up there tonight!

241
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,488
You'll get pitched off your mount in a storm like this.

242
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,866
You'll wish you
hadn't tried it!

243
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,577
lt's too cold! Close it up!

244
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,922
What are we supposed
to do now, huh?

245
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,091
Get on in there
and untangle them

246
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,302
Chilean sheep out
of ours, l guess.

247
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,763
Oh, where is it? Shit!

248
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,188
God, half the goddamn
paint brands have wore off!

249
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,899
We gotta try.
The least we can do is

250
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,401
get the count
right for Aguirre.

251
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,861
Fuck Aguirre!

252
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,321
Oh, yeah, fuck Aguirre.

253
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,822
What if we need to
work for him again?

254
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,282
You think of that?

255
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,576
We gotta stick
this out, Jack.

256
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,970
You'll run them sheep off again if you don't quiet down.

257
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,175
What are you doing?

258
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,512
Aguirre came by again.

259
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,265
Says my uncle
didn't die after all.

260
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,892
Says bring them down.

261
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,853
Bring them down, why?
lt's the middle of August.

262
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,274
Says there's a storm coming,
moving in from the Pacific.

263
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,109
Worse than this one.

264
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,113
That snow barely
stuck an hour. H uh?

265
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:08,743
Besides, that son of a bitch,
he's cutting us out a whole month's pay.

266
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,203
lt ain't right.

267
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,957
Well,

268
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,626
l can spare you a loan, bud,
if you're short on cash.

269
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,545
Give it to you when we get to Signal.

270
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,630
l don't need
your money, huh?

271
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,134
You know, l ain't in
the poorhouse. Shit!

272
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,220
All right.

273
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,339
Time to get going, cowboy.

274
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,812
Come here!

275
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:18,897
This ain't no rodeo, cowboy!

276
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,273
Oh, shit!

277
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,968
Ennis. Ennis.

278
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,682
Come here. You okay?

279
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,976
You okay?
Yeah.

280
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,821
Some of these never
went up there with you.

281
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,285
Count ain't what l'd hoped for, neither.

282
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,664
You ranch stiffs,
you ain't never no good.

283
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,639
Wanna give it some gas?

284
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,568
l can't believe l left
my damn shirt up there.

285
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,738
Yeah.

286
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,659
You gonna do this
again next summer?

287
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,745
Well, maybe not.

288
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,248
Like l said, me and Alma is
getting married in November.

289
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,458
So,

290
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:47,045
l'll try to get something on a ranch,
l guess.

291
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,380
And you?

292
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,092
Might go up to my
daddy's place and

293
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,261
give him a hand
through the winter.

294
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,431
l might be back.

295
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,267
lf the Army don't get me.

296
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,817
Well, l guess l'll
see you around, huh?

297
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,778
Right.

298
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,518
What the fuck are
you looking at? H uh?

299
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,737
"And forgive us
our trespasses

300
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,573
"as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

301
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:42,076
"Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

302
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,329
"For thine is the
kingdom, the power

303
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,497
"and the glory, forever.
Amen."

304
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,834
Under the powers
vested in me,

305
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,503
l now pronounce
you man and wife.

306
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,298
You may kiss the bride.

307
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,883
And if you don't, l will.

308
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,070
You all right?
No.

309
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,241
Stop!

310
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,786
No, please don't!

311
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,419
My old lady's trying to get me to quit this job.

312
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:37,256
She says l'm getting too old to be
breaking my back shoveling asphalt.

313
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:41,052
l told her strong backs and
weak minds runs in the family.

314
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,097
She didn't
think that was too funny.

315
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,265
l told her it keeps me fit.

316
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,105
Morning.

317
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,941
Pulled in last night.

318
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,026
Didn't want to wake you up.

319
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,903
Oh, no, l was just...

320
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,990
l thought I'd teII you before the Sergeant showed up.

321
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,618
Parking this traiIer
on the beach is iIIegaI.

322
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,596
Yeah!

323
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,188
Well, look what
the wind blew in.

324
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,816
H i, Mr. Aguirre.

325
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,527
l was wondering if you was
needing any help this summer.

326
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,821
You're wasting
your time here.

327
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,116
What, you ain't got nothing?

328
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,703
Nothing up on Brokeback?

329
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,957
l ain't got
no work for you.

330
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,510
Ennis Del Mar ain't
been around, has he?

331
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:10,808
You boys sure found a way to
make the time pass up there.

332
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,687
Twist,

333
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,189
you guys wasn't
getting paid to

334
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,690
leave the dogs
baby-sit the sheep

335
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,859
while you stemmed the rose.

336
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,326
Now get the hell
out of my trailer.

337
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,623
How my girls doing?

338
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,794
All right. Jenny's
still got a runny nose.

339
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,486
Ennis, could you wipe Alma J r.
's nose?

340
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,447
lf l had three hands,
l could.

341
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,980
Girls all right?

342
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,817
Yeah.
Jenny stopped her coughing.

343
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,988
l think l should take the
girls into town this weekend.

344
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:32,491
Get them an ice cream.
Something.

345
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,623
Can't we move to town?

346
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,210
l'm tired of these
lonesome old ranches.

347
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,381
No one's around for
Junior to play with.

348
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,342
Besides,
l'm scared for Jenny,

349
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,261
scared if she has another one
of them bad asthma spells.

350
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,513
No, rent in town is too high.

351
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,646
There's a cheap place in Riverton,
over the Laundromat.

352
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,649
l bet l could
fix it up real nice.

353
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:08,110
l bet you could fix this place
up real nice if you wanted to.

354
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,195
Ennis.

355
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,279
H mm?

356
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,949
l know you'd like it, too.

357
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:18,579
Real home,
other kids for the girls to play with.

358
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,293
Not so lonely
like you were raised.

359
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:28,798
You don't want them to
be so lonely, do you?

360
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:33,928
Yeah.

361
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,682
Come here.

362
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,690
lt ain't so lonely now,
is it?

363
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,571
Are you sure the
girls are asleep?

364
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,948
Yeah.

365
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,837
Come here.

366
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:20,975
Ennis.

367
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,563
Let her rip and
snort, boys!

368
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:28,149
Jack Twist,
hanging on for dear Iife!

369
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:32,445
And down he goes!
Watch out there, feIIa!

370
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,239
He's coming for you.
Send in the cIowns!

371
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,616
Okay, a fine ride by Mr.
Twist.

372
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,951
Shit!

373
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,453
Four seconds for him.

374
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:45,291
Give them a hand, folks,
our very own rodeo cIowns!

375
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,254
Give us a beer, Doug.

376
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,978
l'd like to buy
J imbo here a beer.

377
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:10,733
Best damn rodeo clown
l've ever worked with.

378
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,487
No thanks, cowboy.

379
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,947
lf l was to let every rodeo hand l pulled a bull off of

380
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,909
buy me liquor, l'd have
been a alcoholic long ago.

381
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,418
Pulling bulls off of you buckaroos is just my job.

382
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,005
So save your money for your next entry fee, cowboy.

383
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,356
You ever try calf roping?

384
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:58,030
Do l look like l can afford a fucking roping horse?

385
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,881
Shouldn't we move
a little closer?

386
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,424
No. Come on, let's don't.

387
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,009
Jenny'll get scared.

388
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,517
Look at this crowd!

389
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:30,354
Bound to be a lot of pussy on
the hoof in a crowd like this.

390
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,231
All swelled up
with patriotic feeling

391
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,191
and ready to be
humped like a frog.

392
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,068
So, where do you figure the most pussy is at?

393
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,445
Las Vegas or California?

394
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,738
Hell, l don't know,

395
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,282
but if you make
it between Montana

396
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,741
and Wyoming,
l'd take Wyoming...

397
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:46,662
Hey! You might want to keep it down,
l got two little girls here.

398
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,707
Fuck you. Asshole.

399
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,294
Probably quit giving it to his wife after his kids was born.

400
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,378
You know
what that's like.

401
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,462
Yeah.

402
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,343
Ennis, let's move.
Let's just move, okay?

403
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,141
Now, l don't want
any trouble from you.

404
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,351
You need to shut your slop-bucket mouths,
you hear me?

405
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,187
You ought to listen
to your old lady, then.

406
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,646
ls that right?

407
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,440
Yeah. Move somewhere else.

408
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:18,819
What about it?
You wanna lose about half your fucking teeth, huh?

409
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,488
Not tonight, bud.
l'd sure rather not.

410
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,792
Here she comes,
Iadies and gentIemen!

411
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,794
Oh, boy, look at her fly!

00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,408
Come on, girl!

421
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,829
She's headed around two!

422
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,248
Is there anybody

423
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,582
Ma'am.

424
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,376

00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,620
Let's hope he's not!

436
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:52,788
Okay!

You don't think
l'm too fast, do you?

462
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,416
Maybe we should
put the brakes on?

463
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:46,378
Fast or slow, l just like
the direction you're going.

464
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,307
You are in a hurry.

465

My daddy's the hurry.

00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:02,561
He expects me home

Big hurry.

My boss called and, well,

00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,511
Mama.

480
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,764
l guess all the heifers must've
decided to calve at the same time.

481
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,807
l figured l could drop
the girls off with you.

482
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,309
Ennis, well

483
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:45,020

00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,190
Mama, l need crayons.

486
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,691
Not now, Alma.

487
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,694
Ennis, please,
you promised you'd take them tonight.

488
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,531
Alma, l can't afford not to be
there when the heifers calve.

489
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,574
Right, it'd be my job
if l lose any of them.

490
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,284
What about my job?

491
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,957
Okay, all right,
l'll call my sister.

492
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,250
l'll see if
she can take them.

00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,459
All right.
All right.

494
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,628
You be a good girl for
your mama, all right?

l'll be half the night.

496

Come here.
Oh, Alma, please!

498
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,056

Okay.

00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,029
Alma.

506
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,283
lt's just like my hand.

507
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,493
Honey, got
a surprise for you.

508
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:42,869
Hey.

Oh, hell, back seat of

D., l can already see who little Bobby looks like.

Good job, little girl.

518
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:10,856
He's the spitting
image of his grandpa.

519
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,526
lsn't he just the spitting image of his grandpa?

520
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,697
Yeah.

521
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,285
Look at those eyes.

527
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,762
ls he somebody you
cowboy ed with, or what?

528
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,848
No, Jack,
he rodeos, mostly.

529
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,937
We was fishing buddies.

530
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,561
You can
color that one, too.

531
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,521
l'll
color the beach.

532
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,029
Maybe we could
get a baby-sitter.

533
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,866
H uh?

534
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,993
Take your friend to
the Knife and Fork?

535
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,579
No, Jack ain't
the restaurant type.

536
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,249
We'll more likely just
go out and get drunk.

537
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,377
That's if he shows.

538
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:47,012
Okay, we take one more bite,
and then you're finished with dinner.

539
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:50,348
There, that's a good bite.
All right, you're excused.

540
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,851
Please. Thank you.

541
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,207
Jack fucking Twist.

542
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,463
Son of a bitch.

543
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,470
Come here.

544
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,908
Alma, this is Jack Twist.

545
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,452
And, Jack, this
is my wife, Alma.

546
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,162
Howdy.
Hello.

547
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,416
You got a kid.

548
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:42,502
Yeah, l got two little girls.
Alma J r. and Jenny.

549
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,796
l got a boy.
Yeah?

550
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,924
Eight months old.
Smiles a lot.

551
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,636
l married the prettiest little gal in Childress, Texas.

552
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:53,221
Yeah?
Lureen.

553
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:59,394
So me and Jack,
we're gonna head out and get ourselves a drink. Yeah?

554
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:01,646
Sure enough.

555
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,315
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

556
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,733
We might not
get back tonight

557
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,985
when we get to drinking and talking and all.

558
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,194
Ennis?

559
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,614
Would you get me
a pack of smokes?

560
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:13,366
lf you need smokes, Alma,
they're in the top pocket of my blue shirt.

561
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,076
There in the bedroom.

562
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,548
Four years. Damn!

563
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:30,383
Yeah, four years.

564
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,847
Didn't think l'd
hear from you again.

565
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:39,434
l figured you were
sore from that punch.

566
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:43,188
Right next summer,
l drove back up to Brokeback.

567
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,398
Talked to Aguirre
about a job, and...

568
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:48,151
He told me you hadn't
been back, so l left.

569
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:51,863
Went down to
Texas for rodeoing.

570
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:54,783
That's how l met Lureen.

571
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,786
Made $2, 000 that year,
bull riding.

572
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,371
Nearly starved.

573
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:04,250
Lureen's old man makes serious money,
farm machine business.

574
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:06,419
Of course,
he hates my guts.

575
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:12,384
And the Army
didn't get you?

576
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,135
No, too busted up.

577
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,513
And rodeoing ain't what it was in my daddy's day.

578
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,974
Got out while l
could still walk.

579
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:25,063
Swear to God,
l didn't know we was going to get into this again.

580
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,776
Yes l did.
l red-lined it all the way.

581
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,903
l couldn't get
here fast enough.

582
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,239
What about you?

583
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,116
Me? l don't know.

584
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,413
l don't know.

585
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:49,462
Old Brokeback got
us good, don't it?

586
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:57,095
What are we gonna do now?

587
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:03,393
l doubt there's
nothing we can do.

588
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:10,191
So now l'm stuck
with what l got here.

589
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:17,949
Making a living is about all l got time for now.

590
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:43,016
Hey.

591
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,144
Well, me and Jack is headed up
the mountain for a day or two.

592
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,438
Do ourselves
a little fishing.

593
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:59,157
You know, your friend could come inside,
have a cup of coffee.

594
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,950
Well, he's from Texas.

595
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:04,037
Texans don't drink coffee?

596
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,799
You sure that foreman won't fire you for taking off?

597
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,801
You know, that foreman,
he owes me.

598
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:19,761
l worked through
a blizzard last Christmas.

599
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,679
You remember that?

600
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:24,641
Besides, l'll only
be a couple of days.

601
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,230
Bring fish, Daddy.
A big, big one!

602
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:39,030
Come here. Come here.

603
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:46,496
Come here.

604
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:51,626
See you Sunday, latest.

605
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,930
l'm starving. Want to
get something to eat?

606
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:05,056
Yup.

607
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:34,794
Last one in!

608
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,774
ls there anything interesting up there in heaven?

609
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:59,736
Well, l was just sending up a prayer of thanks.

610
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,654
For what?

611
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:06,284
For you forgetting to
bring that harmonica.

612
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,786
l'm enjoying
the peace and quiet.

613
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,502
You know it could be like this,
just like this, always.

614
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:19,756
Yeah?
How do you figure that?

615
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:26,679
What if you and me had
a little ranch somewhere,

616
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,766
a little cow-and-calf
operation?

617
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:31,643
lt'd be a sweet life.

618
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,645
l mean, hell,
Lureen's old man,

619
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:35,813
you bet he'd give me a down payment to get lost.

620
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,608
l mean, he more or
less already said it.

621
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:41,152
No, l...

622
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:46,157
l told you it ain't
gonna be that way.

623
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:50,536
You know,

624
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,707
you got your wife
and baby in Texas.

625
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:58,253
You know,
l got my life in Riverton.

626
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:00,296
ls that so?

627
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:03,091
You and Alma,
that's a life?

628
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,550
Now you shut up about Alma.

629
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,427
This ain't her fault.

630
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,515
The bottom line is,

631
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,685
we're around each other

632
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,771
and this thing
grabs hold of us again

633
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,482
in the wrong place,

634
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,026
in the wrong time,

635
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,237
and we're dead.

636
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,157
l tell you,

637
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:32,120
there were these two old guys
ranched up together down home.

638
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,581
Ear I and Rich.

639
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,793
And they was a joke in town,

640
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:41,713
even though they were pretty tough oId birds.

641
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,637
Anyway, they found Ear I dead

642
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,765
in an irrigation ditch.

643
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:57,312
They took a tire iron
to him, spurred him up

644
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:00,565
and drug him around by his dick tiII it puIIed off.

645
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:04,694
You seen this?

646
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,030
Yeah, l was what?
9 years old.

647
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:12,535
My daddy, he made sure
me and my brother seen it.

648
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:19,625
Hell, for all l know,
he done the job.

649
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,548
Two guys living together?
No way.

650
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,927
Now, we can get together once in a while,

651
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:33,222
way the hell out in the middle of nowhere, but...

652
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:35,641
"Once in a while."

653
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,187
Every four fucking years?

654
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:43,232
Well, if you can't fix it, Jack,
you gotta stand it.

655
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:48,112
For how long?

656
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:52,492
As long as we can ride it.

657
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,208
There ain't no
reins on this one.

658
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:17,975
lt's nearly supper time.

659
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:19,102
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

660
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,144
To work!

661
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,312
l thought
you had the day off!

662
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:22,480
Well,
you thought wrong!

663
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:23,731
The girls
need to be fed.

664
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:24,941
Well, you take care of it!

665
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:27,235
Alma! Alma!

666
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,362
Supper's on the stove!

667
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:31,406
No one's eating
unless you're serving it!

668
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,658
l already promised
l'd take the extra shift!

669
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,202
Fucking tell them you
made a mistake, then!

670
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:38,830
God damn it, Alma! Alma!

671
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,216
You girls need
a push or something?

672
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,634
No.

673
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:03,020
Listen to her
purr, gentlemen!

674
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,523
You ain't gonna get
that with your Caddy!

675
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:08,693
l told you what she could do,
and now let me show you.

676
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,615
Say, didn't that pissant used to ride the bulls?

677
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:18,578
He used to try.

678
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:53,905
Honey, have you seen my blue parka?

679
01:14:55,073 --> 01:14:59,202
Last time l seen it, you was in it,
day we had that big ice storm.

680
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,788
Well, could have sworn l seen it in here.

681
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,708
You know,

682
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,753
you've been going up to Wyoming all these years.

683
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,672
Why can't your buddy come
down here to Texas and fish?

684
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,425
Because the Bighorn
Mountains ain't in Texas.

685
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,512
And l don't think that his pickup
could make it down here, anyway.

686
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:20,806
New model coming in
this week, remember?

687
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:23,684
You're the best
combine salesman we got.

688
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,062
You're the only combine salesman,
in fact.

689
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:29,065
Yeah, l'll be back in a week.
That is, unless l freeze to death,

690
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:30,775
and l'll freeze if l
don't find that parka.

691
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:32,944
Well, l don't have
your goddamn parka.

692
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,445
You know, you're
worse than Bobby

693
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:35,905
when it comes
to losing stuff.

694
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,990
Well, speaking of Bobby,
did you call his school

695
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,117
about getting him a tutor?

696
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,036
l thought you
were gonna call.

697
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,705
l complain too much.
That teacher don't like me.

698
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,374
Now it's your turn.

699
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,459
Okay, fine,
so l'll call later.

700
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:52,129
Right. Fine.

701
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:54,674
Goodbye.

702
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,885
Got 14 hours of
driving ahead of me.

703
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:01,931
See now, it don't seem fair,
you going up there two, three times a year

704
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,100
with him never
coming down here.

705
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:24,912
Ennis, they got an opening over at the power company.
Might be good pay.

706
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:28,165
Well, as clumsy as l am,
l'd probably get electrocuted.

707
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,668
Daddy, the church
picnic's next weekend.

708
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:33,212
Will you be back from
fishing by next weekend?

709
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,755
Please, Daddy? Please!

710
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,675
Well, all right,
as long as l don't have to sing.

711
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,553
Daddy. Thank you.

712
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:42,638
You forgetting something?

713
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:20,843
You're late.

714
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:22,762
Look what l brought.

715
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,390
This way.

716
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:44,867
There you go! No hands!

717
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:47,912
lt's all yours, buddy!
lt's all yours.

718
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,502
Come on, come on.

719
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,097
Come on in, Alvin.

720
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,433
I've been trying to
caII you for hours.

721
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:12,019
lt's Saturday night, you know,
we could still smarten up

722
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:14,689
and head on over
to the church social.

723
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,608
That fire and
brimstone crowd?

724
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,655
l think it'd be nice.

725
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:38,963
Ennis.

726
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:41,298
As far behind as
we are on the bills,

727
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,468
it makes me nervous
not to take no precaution.

728
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:49,932
lf you don't want
no more of my kids,

729
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,977
l'll be happy
to leave you alone.

730
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,399
l'd have them,
if you'd support them.

731
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:18,502
Custody of
the two minor children,

732
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:22,631
Alma Del Mar J r. and Jennifer Del Mar,
is awarded to plaintiff.

733
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:25,259
Defendant is ordered to pay child support to plaintiff

734
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:29,847
in the sum of $125 per month
for each of the minor children

735
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,141
until they reach
the age of 18 years.

736
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:36,687
Del Mar divorce granted,
this sixth day of November, 1975.

737
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:55,164
King of the road!

738
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,210
ln you go.

739
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:12,348
What are you doing here, huh?

740
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:16,435
l got your message
about the divorce.

741
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:18,813
Come here.

742
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:22,066
Well, this here's Jack.

743
01:20:22,108 --> 01:20:23,400
Jack, these are
my little girls.

744
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:25,736
There's Alma J r. and Jenny.

745
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:27,029
H i.

746
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,823
Say hi, girls.
- H i.

747
01:20:34,412 --> 01:20:37,540
l got your card that the divorce came through.

748
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:38,999
Yeah.

749
01:20:39,125 --> 01:20:40,584
So here l am.

750
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,754
l had to ask about 10 different people in Riverton

751
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,756
where you had moved to.

752
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:53,389
l guess, l thought
that this means you...

753
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,563
No, Jack, l don't
know what to say.

754
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:05,359
See, l got the girls this weekend and...

755
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:07,778
Jeez, l...

756
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:11,323
l'm sure as hell sorry.
You know l am.

757
01:21:12,909 --> 01:21:16,620
See, l only get them once a month,
and l missed last month.

758
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:19,498
So l just...
Because of the roundup.

759
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:22,459
So...

760
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:25,838
Well...

761
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:27,298
Yeah, all right.

762
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:30,384
Jack.

763
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:34,638
l'll see you
next month, then.

764
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:27,418
Coming up.

765
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:33,632
Here we go.
Here we are!

766
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,096
Whoa there, Rodeo.

767
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:42,182
The stud duck do
the carving around here.

768
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:43,934
You bet, L. D.

769
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:46,103
l was just saving you the trouble.

770
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:55,404
Bobby, if you don't eat your dinner,

771
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,614
l'm gonna have to
turn off that television.

772
01:23:57,657 --> 01:23:58,782
Why, Mama?

773
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:01,410
l'm gonna be eating this food for the next two weeks.

774
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:03,245
Hey, you heard your mama.

775
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:08,834
You finish your meal,
and then you can watch the game.

776
01:24:21,139 --> 01:24:22,222
Daddy?

777
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:26,268
Daddy.

778
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:31,273
Hell, we don't eat with our eyes.

779
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:35,486
You want your boy to grow up to be a man,
don't you, Daughter?

780
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:38,322
Boys should watch
football.

781
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:44,661
Not until he finishes eating the meal

782
01:24:45,663 --> 01:24:48,248
that his mama took
three hours to fix.

783
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:01,887
Now you sit down,
you old son of a bitch!

784
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:07,184
This is my house,
this is my child

785
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,520
and you are my guest.
Now you sit down

786
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:12,689
before l knock your ignorant ass into next week.

787
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:06,827
Daddy, tell about when you rode broncs in the rodeo.

788
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,415
Well, that's a short story,
honey.

789
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:14,585
lt was only about three seconds l was on that bronc.

790
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:19,173
The next thing l knew,
l was flying through the air,

791
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:22,259
only l was no angel like you and Jenny here.

792
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,344
l didn't have no wings.

793
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:30,142
And that's the story
of my saddle bronc career.

794
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:54,958
There you go.

795
01:27:02,258 --> 01:27:04,176
You ought to get married again, Ennis.

796
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:07,638
Me and the girls worry about you being alone so much.

797
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:10,641
Well, once burned...

798
01:27:14,812 --> 01:27:17,314
You still go fishing with Jack Twist?

799
01:27:19,817 --> 01:27:21,151
Not often.

800
01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:28,533
You know, l used to wonder how come
you never brought any trouts home.

801
01:27:28,618 --> 01:27:29,910
You always said
you caught plenty

802
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:32,496
and you know how me
and the girls like fish.

803
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:37,501
So, one night,
l got your creel case open

804
01:27:37,543 --> 01:27:40,754
night before you went on one of your little trips.

805
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:45,259
Price tag still on
it after five years.

806
01:27:46,177 --> 01:27:48,887
And l tied a note to
the end of the line.

807
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:54,268
lt said, "Hello, Ennis,
bring some fish home. Love, Alma."

808
01:27:54,894 --> 01:27:57,813
And then you come
back looking all perky

809
01:27:57,855 --> 01:28:00,899
and said you caught a bunch of
brownies and you ate them up.

810
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:02,567
Do you remember?

811
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:06,613
l looked in that
case first chance l got

812
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,198
and there was my
note still tied there.

813
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:10,033
That line hadn't touched water in its life.

814
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:12,035
That don't mean nothing,
Alma.

815
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,413
Don't try and fool
me no more, Ennis.

816
01:28:14,497 --> 01:28:17,833
l know what that means.
Jack Twist.

817
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:20,544
Alma.

818
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:23,505
Jack "Nasty"!

819
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,882
You didn't go up there to fish.
You and him...

820
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:28,885
Now you listen to me, you
don't know nothing about it.

821
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,095
l'm going
to yell for Monroe.

822
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:32,806
You do it and l'll make you eat the fucking floor.

823
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:33,890
Get out!

824
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,267
And you, too!

825
01:28:35,351 --> 01:28:36,560
Get out! Get out!

826
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:38,061
Get out of my house,
Ennis Del Mar!

827
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:39,563
You hear me? You get out!

828
01:28:39,605 --> 01:28:41,106
Daddy?

829
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:43,817
Alma?

830
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:47,279
Bye, Daddy!

831
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:50,115
Bye.

832
01:29:03,921 --> 01:29:06,715
Hey, asshole,
watch where you're going!

833
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,718
Jesus. What...

834
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:13,597
Jesus...

835
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:15,140
You stupid fuck!

836
01:29:19,687 --> 01:29:20,937
God damn!

837
01:29:25,151 --> 01:29:28,487
God. God damn.

838
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,322
Oh, fuck!

839
01:29:31,282 --> 01:29:32,491
Damn it!

840
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:24,000
All l'm saying is,
what's the point of making it?

841
01:30:24,335 --> 01:30:27,712
lf the taxes don't get it,
the inflation will eat it all up.

842
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:34,136
You should see
Lureen punching

843
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,263
numbers in her
adding machine.

844
01:30:36,347 --> 01:30:39,182
Hunting for extra zeros,
her eyes getting smaller and smaller.

845
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:42,185
lt's like watching
a rabbit trying to

846
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:45,647
squeeze into a snake hole
with a coyote on its tail.

847
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:48,567
That's some high class
entertainment, if you ask me.

848
01:30:50,194 --> 01:30:51,987
For what it's worth.

849
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:59,119
You and Lureen,
it's normal and all?

850
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:03,540
Sure.

851
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,878
She don't ever suspect?

852
01:31:18,389 --> 01:31:21,057
You ever get the feeling,

853
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,726
l don't know,

854
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:24,686
when you're in town

855
01:31:25,354 --> 01:31:27,147
and someone looks at you

856
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:29,566
suspicious, like he knows.

857
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:33,653
Then you go out on the pavement
and everyone's looking at you

858
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:35,697
like they all know, too?

859
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:44,247
Well, maybe you ought to
get out of there, you know?

860
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:49,586
Find yourself someplace
different, maybe Texas.

861
01:31:50,421 --> 01:31:51,588
Texas?

862
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:55,175
Sure, and maybe
you can convince Alma

863
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:57,260
to let you and
Lureen adopt the girls.

864
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:59,763
Then we could just live
together, herding sheep.

865
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:02,307
And it'll rain money from L.
D. Newsome

866
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:03,725
and whiskey will
flow in the streams.

867
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:05,101
Jack, that's real smart.

868
01:32:05,144 --> 01:32:06,603
Go to hell, Ennis Del Mar.

869
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,272
You wanna live your miserable fucking life?
Then go right ahead.

870
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:11,274
Fine.
l was just thinking out loud.

871
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:13,485
Yup, you're a real thinker there.

872
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:14,945
God damn...

873
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:19,491
Jack fucking Twist.
Got it all figured out, ain't he?

874
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,664
All right, hon.

875
01:32:39,845 --> 01:32:42,722
Just finished my shift.
Wanna dance?

876
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:44,808
l was on my way to the...

877
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:46,810
l'm Cassie.
Cassie Cartwright.

878
01:32:47,144 --> 01:32:49,813
Ennis. Del Mar.

879
01:33:19,051 --> 01:33:21,386
No more dancing for me,
l hope.

880
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,138
You're safe.
Yeah?

881
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,639
My feet hurt.

882
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:26,182
Hard work, is it?

883
01:33:26,225 --> 01:33:30,103
Yeah, drunks like you
demanding beer after beer,

884
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:33,315
smoking. Gets tiresome.

885
01:33:35,484 --> 01:33:37,694
What do you do,
Ennis Del Mar?

886
01:33:39,363 --> 01:33:41,990
Well, earlier today,
l was castrating calves.

887
01:33:47,163 --> 01:33:48,872
What are you doing?

888
01:33:49,373 --> 01:33:51,708
Trying to get
a foot rub, dummy.

889
01:33:55,671 --> 01:33:57,005
All right.

890
01:33:58,674 --> 01:34:00,008
That good?

891
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:24,407
And then l pledged Tri Delt at SMU.

892
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:25,742
And l sure
never thought

893
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:28,244
l'd end up in a poky little place like Childress.

894
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:30,580
Then l met old Randall
here at an Aggie game

895
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:33,249
and he was an
animal husbandry major.

896
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:35,877
So we've been here for a month
and he got the foreman job

897
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,587
over at Roy Taylor's ranch.

898
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:39,422
Like it or not,
here l am!

899
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:43,134
Was you Tri Delt?
l was Kappa Phi myself.

900
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:47,806
Well, even though we ain't quite sorority sisters,

901
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:50,100
we just may have to dance with ourselves, Lureen.

902
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:53,019
Our husbands ain't the least bit interested in dancing.

903
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:55,230
They ain't got a smidgen of rhythm between them.

904
01:34:55,272 --> 01:34:56,356
lt's funny, isn't it?

905
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:00,860
Husbands don't never seem to
wanna dance with their wives.

906
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,655
Why do you
think that is, Jack?

907
01:35:03,739 --> 01:35:06,199
l don't know,
l never give it any thought.

908
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:08,493
Wanna dance?

909
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:11,121
Yes, thank you.

910
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:12,372
Do you mind?

911
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:14,082
No, it's all right.
Go ahead.

912
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:15,500
All right.

913
01:35:16,335 --> 01:35:17,585
Pardon us.

914
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:19,462
Thank you for asking
me to dance with you.

915
01:35:19,505 --> 01:35:21,673
l really appreciate that.
Randall never does.

916
01:35:21,757 --> 01:35:23,550
Last time l did,
l think it was our wedding.

917
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:26,136
lt's a good thing you and Lureen
happened along when you did

918
01:35:26,178 --> 01:35:29,514
or else we'd still be stuck on the
side of the road in that darn pickup.

919
01:35:29,598 --> 01:35:31,099
l told Randall we
ought to take the car.

920
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:32,684
Of course,
he'd never listen to me.

921
01:35:32,768 --> 01:35:35,770
He wouldn't listen to me if he was going deaf tomorrow.

922
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:38,898
l told him it'd take more than
chewing gum and baling wire

923
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:40,525
to fix that pickup.

924
01:35:40,609 --> 01:35:43,236
Well, he's never been
very mechanical, though.

925
01:35:45,614 --> 01:35:47,490
Come over here and ask...

926
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:58,376
You ever notice how a woman will powder
her nose before she goes to a party?

927
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:01,880
And then she'll powder it again once the party's over.

928
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:05,675
l mean,
why powder your nose just to go home and go to bed?

929
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,093
Don't know.

930
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:09,471
Even if l wanted to know,

931
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:12,640
l couldn't get a word in with
Lashawn long enough to ask.

932
01:36:12,683 --> 01:36:15,018
Woman talks a blue streak.

933
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:16,686
Lively little gal.

934
01:36:23,986 --> 01:36:26,070
You'll like working for Roy Taylor.

935
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:27,614
He's solid, Roy.

936
01:36:27,698 --> 01:36:29,616
Yeah, Roy.
He's a good old boy.

937
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:37,582
He's got a little cabin down on Lake Kemp.

938
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:41,336
Got a crappie house,
little boat.

939
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:44,380
Said l could use
it whenever l want.

940
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:50,762
We ought to go down
there some weekend.

941
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:54,057
Drink a little whiskey,
fish some.

942
01:36:55,434 --> 01:36:57,727
Get away, you know?

943
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:02,398
That was
right out of SMU.

944
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:04,943
l could've had my pick of pretty
much any job in North Dallas.

945
01:37:05,027 --> 01:37:07,403
So my pick was Neiman Marcus,
which was a disaster

946
01:37:07,446 --> 01:37:10,573
because, honey, where clothes is concerned,
l got no resistance.

947
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:12,242
l was spending
more than l made.

948
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:13,910
More than
Randall ever will make.

949
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:17,121
We come out here thinking that ranching
was still big hats and Marlboros.

950
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:19,082
Boy, were we
behind the times.

951
01:37:35,766 --> 01:37:37,934
Hey there, Junior.
You ready?

952
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,868
What do you think?

953
01:37:55,786 --> 01:37:59,080
Your daddy ever gonna see
fit to settle down again?

954
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:04,168
Don't know.
Maybe he's not the marrying kind.

955
01:38:06,755 --> 01:38:08,464
You don't think so?

956
01:38:09,133 --> 01:38:11,801
Or you don't think
l'm the one for him?

957
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:16,639
You're good enough.

958
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:24,814
You don't say much,
but you get your point across.

959
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:29,319
Sorry. l didn't
mean to be rude.

960
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:33,072
All right.

961
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:36,451
You're staying on
your feet, cowboy.

962
01:38:37,536 --> 01:38:39,037
Excuse me, darling.

963
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:05,605
So l'll pick you and Jenny up next weekend,
after church.

964
01:39:07,066 --> 01:39:08,191
Fine.

965
01:39:11,862 --> 01:39:13,363
You all right?

966
01:39:14,657 --> 01:39:15,698
Yes.

967
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:18,368
Are you sure?

968
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:24,832
Daddy, l was thinking,
what with the new baby and all,

969
01:39:24,875 --> 01:39:27,293
Ma and Monroe have been awful strict on me.

970
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:29,462
More on me
than Jenny even.

971
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:32,715
l was thinking,
maybe l could...

972
01:39:35,177 --> 01:39:37,553
Maybe l could
come stay with you.

973
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:41,265
l'd be an awful good help,
l know l would.

974
01:39:41,725 --> 01:39:44,727
Now, you know l
ain't set up for that.

975
01:39:46,563 --> 01:39:48,690
With the roundup coming,

976
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,442
l won't ever be home.

977
01:39:52,903 --> 01:39:54,737
lt's all right, Daddy.

978
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,739
l'm not saying
that l wouldn't...

979
01:39:56,824 --> 01:39:58,741
lt's all right,
l understand.

980
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:03,371
Well, see you
on Sunday, then.

981
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:05,415
Bye.

982
01:40:07,918 --> 01:40:09,544
Bye, sweetheart.

983
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:41,701
Going to snow
tonight for sure.

984
01:40:42,619 --> 01:40:43,661
Yup.

985
01:40:51,462 --> 01:40:54,964
All this time and you ain't found nobody else to marry?

986
01:40:56,592 --> 01:41:00,928
l been putting the blocks to a
good-looking little gal over in Riverton.

987
01:41:02,973 --> 01:41:04,432
She's a waitress.

988
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:06,934
Wants to go to nursing school or something.

989
01:41:09,313 --> 01:41:10,646
l don't know.

990
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:16,444
What about you and Lureen?

991
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:21,491
Lureen's good at making hard
deals in the machinery business

992
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:23,993
but as far as
our marriage goes,

993
01:41:24,828 --> 01:41:27,080
we could do it
over the phone.

994
01:41:36,673 --> 01:41:39,425
l kind of got
this thing going

995
01:41:40,344 --> 01:41:43,012
with a ranch foreman's
wife over in Rutters.

996
01:41:43,347 --> 01:41:45,014
What?
l'm bound to get shot

997
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:48,434
by Lureen or her husband each time l slip off to see her.

998
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:51,646
You probably deserve it.

999
01:41:58,737 --> 01:42:00,321
Tell you what.

1000
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:06,911
The truth is,

1001
01:42:13,877 --> 01:42:17,171
sometimes l miss you so much,
l can hardly stand it.

1002
01:42:59,506 --> 01:43:02,258
l guess l'll head up
on to Lightning Flat.

1003
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:06,012
See the folks
for a day or two.

1004
01:43:11,768 --> 01:43:14,979
There's something l been
meaning to tell you, bud.

1005
01:43:19,484 --> 01:43:22,987
Well, it's likely November before
l can come out here again.

1006
01:43:25,782 --> 01:43:30,036
After we ship stock and before
winter feeding starts again.

1007
01:43:33,957 --> 01:43:35,166
November.

1008
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:42,215
What in the hell ever
happened to August?

1009
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:43,883
Well...

1010
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:48,554
Christ, Ennis.

1011
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:58,189
You know, you had a fucking week
to say some little word about this.

1012
01:44:01,193 --> 01:44:03,653
Why is it we're always in the frigging cold?

1013
01:44:03,695 --> 01:44:06,697
We ought to go south where it's warm,
you know!

1014
01:44:06,782 --> 01:44:08,491
We ought to
go to Mexico.

1015
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:10,660
Mexico?

1016
01:44:11,995 --> 01:44:14,247
Hell, Jack, you know me.
About all the traveling l ever done

1017
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:17,375
is around a coffee pot,
looking for the handle.

1018
01:44:20,003 --> 01:44:22,338
Come on, Jack.
Lighten up on me.

1019
01:44:24,633 --> 01:44:26,592
We can hunt in November.

1020
01:44:27,302 --> 01:44:29,011
Kill us a nice elk.

1021
01:44:31,556 --> 01:44:33,182
l'll try if l can get
Don Wroe's cabin again.

1022
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:35,977
We had a good time
that year, didn't we?

1023
01:44:38,605 --> 01:44:41,315
There's never enough
time, never enough.

1024
01:44:46,071 --> 01:44:47,822
You know, friend,

1025
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:52,118
this is a goddamn bitch of an unsatisfactory situation.

1026
01:44:53,203 --> 01:44:54,996
You used to
come away easy.

1027
01:44:55,038 --> 01:44:56,956
Now it's like
seeing the Pope.

1028
01:44:59,876 --> 01:45:01,669
Jack, l got to work.

1029
01:45:04,673 --> 01:45:07,550
ln them earlier days,
l'd just quit the job.

1030
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:11,637
You...

1031
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:15,182
You forget what it's like being broke all the time.

1032
01:45:19,187 --> 01:45:21,480
You ever hear
of child support?

1033
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:29,739
l'll tell you this,
l can't quit this one and l can't get the time off.

1034
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:35,828
lt was hard enough
getting this time.

1035
01:45:35,912 --> 01:45:37,580
The trade-off was August.

1036
01:45:41,626 --> 01:45:43,502
Well, you got a better idea?

1037
01:45:46,298 --> 01:45:47,715
l did, once.

1038
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:51,677
You did, once.

1039
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,143
Well, have you been
to Mexico, Jack Twist?

1040
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:04,982
'Cause l hear what they got
in Mexico for boys like you.

1041
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:10,279
Hell, yes, l've been to Mexico.
ls that a fucking problem?

1042
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:21,791
l'm going to tell you this one time,
Jack fucking Twist.

1043
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:23,626
And l ain't fooling.

1044
01:46:24,961 --> 01:46:28,631
What l don't know,
all them things that l don't know

1045
01:46:29,007 --> 01:46:31,926
could get you killed
if l come to know them.

1046
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:37,640
l ain't joking.

1047
01:46:42,437 --> 01:46:45,106
Yeah, well try this one,
and l'll say it just once.

1048
01:46:45,148 --> 01:46:46,482
Go ahead!

1049
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:47,858
l'll tell you what.

1050
01:46:47,943 --> 01:46:49,402
We could have had
a good life together.

1051
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:52,863
Fucking real good life.
Had us a place of our own!

1052
01:46:53,698 --> 01:46:55,783
But you didn't
want it, Ennis.

1053
01:46:55,826 --> 01:46:58,661
So what we got now
is Brokeback Mountain!

1054
01:47:00,872 --> 01:47:02,248
Everything's built on that!

1055
01:47:02,332 --> 01:47:04,166
That's all we got, boy.
Fucking all.

1056
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:06,877
So l hope you know that,
if you don't never know the rest!

1057
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:08,087
God damn it.

1058
01:47:08,171 --> 01:47:09,213
You count the
damn few times

1059
01:47:09,297 --> 01:47:11,257
that we have been together in nearly 20 years

1060
01:47:11,341 --> 01:47:13,300
and you measure the short
fucking leash you keep me on

1061
01:47:13,343 --> 01:47:14,677
and then you
ask me about Mexico

1062
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:16,011
and you tell me
you'll kill me

1063
01:47:16,054 --> 01:47:19,140
for needing something
l don't hardly never get!

1064
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:24,645
You have no idea
how bad it gets!

1065
01:47:28,191 --> 01:47:31,110
And l'm not you!
l can't make it

1066
01:47:31,194 --> 01:47:34,697
on a couple of high-altitude fucks once or twice a year!

1067
01:47:37,284 --> 01:47:39,577
You are too
much for me, Ennis.

1068
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:42,413
You son of a whoreson bitch!

1069
01:47:44,583 --> 01:47:46,834
l wish l knew
how to quit you!

1070
01:47:49,629 --> 01:47:51,380
Then why don't you?

1071
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:56,719
Why don't you
just let me be, huh?

1072
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:01,891
lt's because of you,
Jack, that l'm like this.

1073
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:06,687
l'm nothing.

1074
01:48:07,355 --> 01:48:08,731
l'm nowhere.

1075
01:48:13,403 --> 01:48:14,737
lt's okay.

1076
01:48:14,779 --> 01:48:16,280
Get the fuck off me!

1077
01:48:23,121 --> 01:48:25,748
lt's all right.
lt's all right.

1078
01:48:26,791 --> 01:48:28,417
Damn you, Ennis.

1079
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,546
l just can't stand
this anymore, Jack.

1080
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:46,644
Come on now,
you're sleeping on your feet like a horse.

1081
01:48:48,647 --> 01:48:51,815
My mama used to say that to me when l was little.

1082
01:48:52,859 --> 01:48:54,568
And sing to me.

1083
01:49:08,416 --> 01:49:09,792
l got to go.

1084
01:49:12,754 --> 01:49:14,672
See you in the morning.

1085
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:11,186
Excuse me.

1086
01:50:16,234 --> 01:50:17,318
Hey.

1087
01:50:18,278 --> 01:50:19,778
Ennis Del Mar.

1088
01:50:23,366 --> 01:50:24,867
Where you been?

1089
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:28,370
Here and there.

1090
01:50:31,041 --> 01:50:34,209
l left word for you
with Steve at the ranch.

1091
01:50:35,253 --> 01:50:38,631
And you must've got those notes l left at your place.

1092
01:50:42,427 --> 01:50:45,220
Looks like l got the message,
in any case.

1093
01:50:47,307 --> 01:50:48,390
Carl?

1094
01:50:50,226 --> 01:50:52,227
Yeah, Carl's nice.

1095
01:50:52,979 --> 01:50:54,480
He even talks.

1096
01:50:57,692 --> 01:50:59,151
Good for you.

1097
01:51:01,529 --> 01:51:02,613
Yeah.

1098
01:51:05,617 --> 01:51:07,034
Good for me.

1099
01:51:13,458 --> 01:51:15,751
l don't get you,
Ennis Del Mar.

1100
01:51:21,091 --> 01:51:22,424
l'm sorry.

1101
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:33,435
l was probably no
fun anyways, was l?

1102
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:39,858
Ennis, girls don't
fall in love with fun.

1103
01:52:22,777 --> 01:52:24,445
Hello.

1104
01:52:24,487 --> 01:52:26,405
Hello, this is
Ennis De I Mar.

1105
01:52:29,576 --> 01:52:31,201
Who? Who is this?

1106
01:52:32,787 --> 01:52:35,581
Ennis Del Mar.
l'm an old buddy of Jack's.

1107
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:38,667
Jack used to
mention you.

1108
01:52:39,169 --> 01:52:42,838
You're the fishing buddy or the hunting buddy,
l know that.

1109
01:52:43,923 --> 01:52:45,674
Would have let you
know what happened

1110
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:48,302
but l wasn't sure about your name or address.

1111
01:52:48,344 --> 01:52:51,305
Jack kept his friends'
addresses in his head.

1112
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:56,143
That's why l'm calling,
to see what happened.

1113
01:52:58,146 --> 01:52:59,688
Oh, yeah.

1114
01:53:02,358 --> 01:53:05,068
Jack was pumping up
a flat on the truck

1115
01:53:05,153 --> 01:53:07,863
out on a back road,
when the tire blew up.

1116
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:10,908
The rim of the tire
slammed into his face,

1117
01:53:11,117 --> 01:53:15,037
broke his nose and jaw and knocked
him unconscious on his back.

1118
01:53:16,289 --> 01:53:18,040
By the time
somebody come aIong,

1119
01:53:18,082 --> 01:53:20,000
he'd drowned
in his own bIood.

1120
01:53:20,877 --> 01:53:22,878
He was onIy 39 years oId.

1121
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:29,885
HeIIo? HeIIo?

1122
01:53:31,137 --> 01:53:32,387
HeIIo.

1123
01:53:36,226 --> 01:53:38,227
Was he buried down there?

1124
01:53:38,728 --> 01:53:40,187
We put a stone up.

1125
01:53:40,647 --> 01:53:42,689
He was cremated,
like he wanted.

1126
01:53:42,732 --> 01:53:44,817
Half his ashes
was interred here,

1127
01:53:44,943 --> 01:53:47,110
the rest was sent
up with his folks.

1128
01:53:48,279 --> 01:53:50,239
He use to say he
wanted his ashes

1129
01:53:50,323 --> 01:53:52,324
scattered on
Brokeback Mountain,

1130
01:53:52,408 --> 01:53:54,785
but I wasn't
sure where that was.

1131
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:58,914
I thought Brokeback Mountain
might be around where he grew up.

1132
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:00,290
Knowing Jack,

1133
01:54:00,375 --> 01:54:02,626
it might be
some pretend place

1134
01:54:02,710 --> 01:54:05,921
where bluebirds sing
and there's a whiskey spring.

1135
01:54:08,883 --> 01:54:11,301
No, ma'am,

1136
01:54:11,386 --> 01:54:14,513
we was herding sheep
on Brokeback one summer

1137
01:54:15,139 --> 01:54:16,557
back in '63.

1138
01:54:25,984 --> 01:54:28,694
Well, he said it was his favorite place.

1139
01:54:30,071 --> 01:54:31,655
l thought he
meant to get drunk.

1140
01:54:31,739 --> 01:54:33,282
He drank a lot.

1141
01:54:36,452 --> 01:54:39,329
ls his folks still
up in Lightning Flat?

1142
01:54:39,998 --> 01:54:42,708
They'II be there
tiII the day they die.

1143
01:54:47,755 --> 01:54:49,715
Thank you for your time.

1144
01:54:50,592 --> 01:54:52,175
I sure am sorry.

1145
01:54:53,428 --> 01:54:55,178
We was good friends.

1146
01:55:02,353 --> 01:55:04,605
Get in touch
with his folks.

1147
01:55:04,647 --> 01:55:08,525
l suppose they'd appreciate it
if his wishes was carried out.

1148
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,279
About the ashes, l mean.

1149
01:56:13,299 --> 01:56:14,758
Want a cup of coffee,
don't you?

1150
01:56:14,842 --> 01:56:16,510
Piece of cherry cake?

1151
01:56:16,552 --> 01:56:18,136
Yes, ma'am,
l'll have a cup of coffee

1152
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:21,390
but l can't eat no
cake just now. Thank you.

1153
01:56:30,441 --> 01:56:32,609
l feel awful
bad about Jack.

1154
01:56:35,071 --> 01:56:36,405
Thank you.

1155
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:41,159
l can't begin to tell you how bad l feel.

1156
01:56:44,163 --> 01:56:46,081
l knew him a long time.

1157
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:50,919
l come by to say that

1158
01:56:51,587 --> 01:56:55,257
if you want me to take his ashes up there on Brokeback

1159
01:56:55,967 --> 01:56:58,427
like his wife
said he wanted to,

1160
01:56:59,178 --> 01:57:00,971
then l'll be happy to.

1161
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:05,809
l'll tell you what.

1162
01:57:06,894 --> 01:57:09,271
l know where
Brokeback Mountain is.

1163
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:12,607
Thought he was
too goddamn special

1164
01:57:12,692 --> 01:57:14,693
to be buried in
the family plot.

1165
01:57:18,114 --> 01:57:20,615
Jack used to say...

1166
01:57:20,658 --> 01:57:23,326
"Ennis Del Mar,"
he used to say.

1167
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:28,290
"l'm gonna bring him
up here one of these days

1168
01:57:28,916 --> 01:57:31,835
"and we'll lick this
damn ranch into shape."

1169
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:35,130
He had some
half-baked notion

1170
01:57:35,173 --> 01:57:38,175
the two of you was
gonna move up here,

1171
01:57:38,259 --> 01:57:42,637
build a cabin,
help run the place.

1172
01:57:46,184 --> 01:57:47,934
Then, this spring,

1173
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:52,773
he got another fella gonna come up here with him,

1174
01:57:54,442 --> 01:57:57,652
build the place,
help run the ranch.

1175
01:57:58,654 --> 01:58:03,075
Some ranch neighbor of
his from down in Texas.

1176
01:58:05,161 --> 01:58:09,164
Gonna split up with his
wife and come back here,

1177
01:58:09,207 --> 01:58:10,582
so he says.

1178
01:58:12,418 --> 01:58:14,753
But, like most
of Jack's ideas,

1179
01:58:16,589 --> 01:58:18,340
never come to pass.

1180
01:58:21,469 --> 01:58:25,347
l kept his room like
it was when he was a boy.

1181
01:58:26,724 --> 01:58:28,850
l think he appreciated that.

1182
01:58:33,397 --> 01:58:36,608
You are welcome to go up
to his room, if you want.

1183
01:58:42,281 --> 01:58:44,574
Yeah, l'd like that.
Thank you.

1184
02:01:45,756 --> 02:01:47,382
Tell you what.

1185
02:01:49,885 --> 02:01:53,596
We got a family plot.
He's going in it.

1186
02:01:56,267 --> 02:01:57,559
Yes, sir.

1187
02:02:00,146 --> 02:02:02,439
You come back
and see us again.

1188
02:02:16,746 --> 02:02:18,246
Thank you, ma'am.

1189
02:03:16,055 --> 02:03:17,389
Hey there, Junior.

1190
02:03:17,473 --> 02:03:18,723
Hey, Daddy.

1191
02:03:27,566 --> 02:03:28,858
Come here.

1192
02:03:31,654 --> 02:03:33,154
Like the car?

1193
02:03:33,614 --> 02:03:35,323
Yeah. ls it yours?

1194
02:03:35,408 --> 02:03:36,741
lt's Kurt's.

1195
02:03:37,159 --> 02:03:39,411
l thought you
were seeing Troy.

1196
02:03:39,495 --> 02:03:40,745
Troy?

1197
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:43,039
Daddy, that
was two years ago.

1198
02:03:44,792 --> 02:03:47,085
Troy still
playing baseball?

1199
02:03:47,169 --> 02:03:50,672
l don't know what he's doing.
l'm seeing Kurt now.

1200
02:03:50,756 --> 02:03:52,340
Well, what does Kurt do?

1201
02:03:52,383 --> 02:03:54,217
Works out in
the oil fields.

1202
02:03:55,678 --> 02:03:57,345
So he's a roughneck, huh?

1203
02:03:57,430 --> 02:03:59,013
Yeah.

1204
02:03:59,849 --> 02:04:03,685
l guess you're 19,
you can do whatever you want. lsn't that right?

1205
02:04:03,769 --> 02:04:05,061
Sure.

1206
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:15,697
Daddy, you need more furniture.

1207
02:04:15,739 --> 02:04:17,198
Yeah, well,

1208
02:04:17,366 --> 02:04:20,201
if you got nothing,
you don't need nothing.

1209
02:04:24,707 --> 02:04:26,708
So, what's the occasion?

1210
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:32,380
Me and Kurt,

1211
02:04:33,716 --> 02:04:35,550
we're getting married.

1212
02:04:38,345 --> 02:04:39,721
Well...

1213
02:04:40,848 --> 02:04:43,183
So how long have you
known this guy for?

1214
02:04:43,225 --> 02:04:44,726
About a year.

1215
02:04:46,729 --> 02:04:50,064
Our wedding will be June 5,
at the Methodist church.

1216
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:54,194
Jenny will be singing and Monroe
is gonna cater the reception.

1217
02:05:00,659 --> 02:05:02,660
Now this Kurt fella,

1218
