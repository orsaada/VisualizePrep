1
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:36,202
Stroke! Stroke!

2
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,723
Come on, come on.

3
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:03,312
Pick him up, pick him up.

4
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,022
Son of a bitch!

5
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,483
I mean, Your Honor,
that was a hell of a shot.

6
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,280
Well, I'm currently doing an externship
for two extra credits

7
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,449
as a clerk for Judge Hookstratten.

8
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,868
B. J. Hookstratten?

9
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:20,580
That's more impressive
than being in the top 5%.

10
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,291
Look, I don't know what kind of offers
you've had from Wall Street...

11
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,294
The top five, sir. In my class.

12
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,004
Not the top 5%. I'm sorry, I just...

13
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,299
Mr. McDeere, we've just offered you
$68,000 a year

14
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,760
from arguably
the leading law firm in Chicago.

15
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,636
Is there somewhere else
you have to be?

16
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,472
Yes, sir. I have a job.
I'm just on lunch break.

17
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,349
I know you've had a lot of offers.

18
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,394
Did you know, for example,
that we have 127 clients

19
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,355
that are Fortune 500 companies?
Now, look, we'll offer you $74,000...

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,275
...our billing requirement for a
first-year associate is only 2,000 hours,

21
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,528
not the usual 25 or 26 or 2,700.

22
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,448
We want you
to have a life outside the office, Mitch.

23
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,284
And if you're a Lakers fan,
we have a fabulous box at the Forum.

24
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,876
I know there are firms
from all over the country

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,420
that have been up here
offering you everything.

26
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:12,632
But with your ability and ambition,
there is only one place for you,

27
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,841
and that's with our firm in Washington...

28
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,384
Let's stop talking about
the ribbon on the package,

29
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,512
and start talking about
what's in the package.

30
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,056
One of our partners is an ex-governor,
two are congressmen

31
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,141
and one's a former
Senator of Agriculture.

32
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,853
May I take your coat, sir?

33
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,744
- Mitchell McDeere, right?
- Yes.

34
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,913
Lamar Quinn. Come on in.

35
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,374
I'd like you to meet

36
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,836
- Oliver Lambert, our senior partner.
- Mitch. Mitch.

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,587
- How do you do, sir?
- This is Royce McKnight,

38
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,797
- our managing partner.
- How do you do, sir?

39
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,799
- Welcome.
- Care for a drink?

40
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,510
- No, I'm fine.
- Take a seat, Mitch.

41
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,473
Tired of interviews?

42
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,268
No, sir.
I just don't quite know what to say.

43
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,186
Unusual for a lawyer.

44
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,398
I can get tongue-tied
in any number of situations, sir,

45
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,900
but it's usually with my wife.

46
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:16,487
Would you mind describing one,
with your wife?

47
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,075
The first time I saw her.

48
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,952
Any time we argue.

49
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,623
Whenever she walks into a room,
as a matter of fact.

50
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,960
Might we ask
about the rest of your family?

51
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,380
My father was killed in the coal mines

52
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,174
and my mother remarried
and lives in Florida.

53
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,218
Brothers and sisters?

54
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,554
None.

55
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,433
Mitch, I hope
you don't think us intrusive,

56
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,729
but stability in the family
has a special importance for us.

57
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:53,608
Bendini, Lambert & Locke
is just a small Memphis firm,

58
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,610
41 lawyers.

59
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:59,822
But we're a large family.
So we're careful.

60
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:03,326
Now, sir,
do you have any questions for us?

61
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,330
Do you have an offer in mind?

62
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,255
It includes a bonus schedule,

63
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,759
a low-interest mortgage
so you can buy a home,

64
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:24,221
country club membership,
and we'll lease you a new Mercedes.

65
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,348
You pick the color, Mitch.

66
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,266
Lamar, you haven't been
paying attention.

67
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,477
His wife picks the color.

68
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:38,361
- Do I... Do I open it here?
- Of course.

69
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,155
Unless you can tell us what's in it.

70
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,953
A lawyer worth that offer
shouldn't have to open the envelope.

71
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,546
Mr. McKnight, you are
the managing partner

72
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,674
at Bendini, Lambert & Locke,
is that correct?

73
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:00,800
Yes.

74
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,176
Did Mr. Lambert, as senior partner,

75
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,054
give you any instructions
regarding my employment?

76
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,389
He did.

77
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,435
And, Mr. McKnight, do you usually
follow Mr. Lambert's instructions?

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,647
Objection. Vague. Ambiguous.

79
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,107
Sustained.

80
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,446
What precisely were those instructions?

81
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,991
That you were in great demand,
and I should make certain

82
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:29,453
that we obtained your services
before a bidding situation developed.

83
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,332
How did you go about making certain?

84
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,962
I bribed a clerk
in the Harvard Law placement office

85
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,965
for the exact amount
of the highest offer,

86
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,260
and then added 20%.

87
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,931
Mitch, the letter you got
from Bendini, Lambert & Locke

88
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:52,184
was the only one sent out. We want you.

89
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,089
Okay.

90
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,760
You're gonna have to leave now.
I'm expecting my husband.

91
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,595
The hell with him.

92
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,139
Come here.

93
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,646
Moo shu pork, Szechwan beef,
mandarin duck from Wong Boys.

94
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,109
It's even got a cork.

95
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,861
What's going on?

96
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,364
You remember the letter I got
from that firm in Memphis?

97
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,824
Memphis?

98
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,951
That's what I thought, until their offer.

99
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,578
What was the offer?

100
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,581
They didn't say. It's in there.

101
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,797
It's sealed.

102
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,215
I guessed.

103
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,050
What?

104
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,427
Yeah, but I'm a good guesser.

105
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,939
Plus a 5% increase the second year.

106
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,358
Why?

107
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,820
"Why?" Whose side are you on anyway?

108
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,656
Yours.

109
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,492
Plus bonuses,
plus a low interest mortgage...

110
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,202
As in a home, with grass around it?

111
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,914
They want to fly us down to Memphis
for a little visit.

112
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,569
If you've been in one limo,
you've been in them all.

113
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,371
Bye. See you later, Your Honor.

114
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,089
Sir.

115
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,053
Hey, Mitch.

116
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,805
Come on, associates first,

117
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,641
then lunch with the partners
in our private dining room.

118
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,562
He's our number one draft pick,
so to speak,

119
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,566
and he's being romanced
by the big boys

120
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,776
from New York and Chicago
and everywhere else,

121
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:52,114
so we have to sell him on
our little firm here in Memphis.

122
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,284
Meanwhile, he's gonna try
not to be embarrassed

123
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,455
while I remind you that he's about to
graduate from Harvard with honors.

124
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,623
Hear, hear.

125
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,464
No one's divorced in the Firm?

126
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,466
No one's divorced in the Firm.

127
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,135
- Impossible.
- No bachelors either.

128
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,137
What about women?

129
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,306
- They had one once.
- Only one?

130
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,559
Alice Krauss,
wobbled around on 4" heels.

131
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,978
Affirmative action on stilts.

132
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,898
All white, all male, all married, huh?

133
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,908
- What the hell is this?
- There he goes.

134
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,159
Hey!

135
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,016
It's different from the northeast.

136
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,311
The pace, we're almost stately
by comparison.

137
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,440
Courteous and not as gossipy.

138
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,693
We keep each other's secrets.

139
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,194
I like that.

140
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,614
What do you like about it?

141
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,119
All of it. It's a family.
Just the way you said.

142
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,379
For the last three years,

143
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,965
I've been teaching in the Boston area
at a private school.

144
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,216
Do you work?

145
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,802
Well, not since
I put Lamar through law school.

146
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,804
But, you know, working isn't forbidden.

147
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,390
- Forbidden?
- Working, by the Firm, you know.

148
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,642
- How could it be forbidden?
- It isn't.

149
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:47,813
Anyway, two babies in 14 months
and I had all the work I could handle.

150
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,566
- Do you plan to start a family?
- Maybe in a couple of years.

151
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,568
The Firm encourages children.

152
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,236
How do they do that exactly?

153
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,580
Hey, how about it?

154
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,248
How about it.

155
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,339
Okay, okay. The Love Boat band,
the secret recipe ribs,

156
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,673
they're a little square maybe...

157
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:18,093
I don't mind square. I like square.
Weird, I mind.

158
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,262
What do you mean, "weird"?

159
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,597
Well, here's a quote.

160
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,684
"The Firm does not forbid me to take
a job, and they encourage children."

161
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,353
Ask me why.

162
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,021
Because they love kids.

163
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,690
Because children promote stability.

164
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,193
Want to hear more?

165
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,613
No, you're right.

166
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,449
Don't pay any attention. I'm just gonna
throw myself over the rail.

167
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:44,244
- I think my will is self-explanatory.
- Okay, okay, okay.

168
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,955
These are nice people, Abby.

169
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,540
These are nice people. Okay.

170
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,876
I'm more impressed with it than you are.
You grew up with it.

171
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,963
Do you know
what $96,000 a year is here?

172
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,799
It's like 150 in New York.

173
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,801
Did you ever think
I'd make a six-figure salary?

174
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,552
Absolutely.

175
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,888
You did?

176
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:10,312
Well, your folks! Your folks
are only a few hours away, too.

177
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,731
You mean, if we fight,
I don't have far to drive.

178
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,316
Exactly.

179
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,411
She made two phone calls
from the hotel,

180
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,664
one to her parents
and one to the Memphis School Board.

181
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,168
She seemed a little reluctant.

182
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,004
I'd hate to lose this young man.

183
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,756
I think she'll come around.

184
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,592
What about Kozinski and Hodges?

185
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,637
Have you spoken to Chicago?

186
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,014
I have.

187
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,476
It's not good.

188
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,312
We're gonna have to do something.

189
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,163
I drew the happy face.

190
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,499
Where's Memphis?

191
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,161
Is that it?

192
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,580
- Yeah?
- It looks different.

193
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,583
It's prettier than the pictures they sent.

194
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,796
"Mitch and Abby, we've taken the liberty
of furnishing the house temporarily.

195
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,714
"Just a few things
to make you feel at home.

196
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,466
"Hope you don't mind."

197
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,601
Abby!

198
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,819
Not bad, huh?

199
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,154
Where's yours?

200
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,507
- Don't get up.
- Don't worry.

201
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,605
Mitchell McDeere.

202
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,315
Tad eager are we, Mr. McDeere?

203
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,323
What are you doing?

204
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,075
Dutch says you've been here since 6:30.

205
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,660
I thought
I'd jump start the bar exam work.

206
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,079
Good. No associate
has ever failed the bar exam, you know.

207
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,914
Come on. I'll show you your new office.

208
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,832
Wally Hudson, Contracts.

209
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,584
- Here to help with the bar exam.
- Thanks, Wally.

210
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,587
No associate of the Firm
has ever failed the bar exam.

211
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,006
The first day
is a four-hour multiple choice on ethics.

212
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:52,594
Look at the first six chapters.
I'll see you Wednesday, 8:45.

213
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,182
Oh, no associate of this firm
has ever failed the bar exam.

214
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,934
No kidding.

215
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,938
- Ken Curry. Domestic Relations.
- Mike Allen. Wills and Estates.

216
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,606
Nina.

217
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,358
Fuck! Please.

218
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,737
I'm sorry. Can I help you?

219
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,614
Actually, I think I'm here to help you.

220
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,409
I'm Avery Tolar,
your designated mentor.

221
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,660
Let's go to lunch.

222
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,286
Lunch? But it's not even...

223
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,540
Not even noon, I know.
It will be a working lunch.

224
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,793
Come on up to my office
while I drop this off.

225
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,004
Everything depends on billing.

226
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,173
How many hours you spend
even thinking about a client.

227
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,261
I don't care if you're stuck in traffic
or shaving or sitting on a park bench.

228
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,804
Now, my particular field...

229
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,140
Is forming limited partnerships
for offshore corporations,

230
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,850
mainly in the Cayman Islands.

231
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:44,104
Good. I want you to review the last one
I did for a client named Sonny Capps.

232
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,814
He made over 14 million last year,

233
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,442
paid less than 4% in taxes
and resents every buck of it.

234
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:52,279
But he paid us $400,000 in fees,
so I don't want to make him unhappy.

235
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,322
Take a look at the deal,
see if you can come up with anything.

236
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,158
Madge, tell him
I'll call him in the morning, please.

237
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,160
Yes, Mr. Tolar.
Should I save these for later?

238
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,370
- Could you, please?
- What do you mean by "anything"?

239
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,538
What do you think I mean?

240
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,665
I don't know, you're the risk taker.

241
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,584
Do you think
I'm talking about breaking the law?

242
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,253
No, I'm just trying to figure out
how far you want it bent.

243
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,881
As far as you can without breaking it.

244
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,382
In other words, don't risk an IRS audit.

245
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,218
I don't give a damn about an audit.
They just better not win.

246
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,596
Yes, Mr. Tolar?

247
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,556
Something before lunch?

248
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:23,727
I should warn you the Firm frowns
on drinking during office hours.

249
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,353
Iced tea, please.

250
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,731
Bombay martini on the rocks, Ellis,
three olives.

251
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,232
On the way.

252
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,776
Senator.

253
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,695
I'm allowed a few minor rebellions.

254
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,032
- Put that in the bedroom, please.
- Hey, hon, I made you some tea.

255
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,285
Kay, please. I've never had so many
people trying to do things for me.

256
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,622
It's the South, Abby.
We encumber you with hospitality.

257
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,583
Would you like to have your phone
programmed for speed dialing, ma'am?

258
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,961
Other than my husband's office number,
let's see, that's...

259
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,215
We have it, Mrs. McDeere.
We do all the installations for the Firm.

260
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,636
What led you to law school?

261
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,264
- I can't remember, really.
- Sure you can, Counselor.

262
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,686
I was a delivery boy for a pizza parlor.

263
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,688
One day the owner
got a notice from the IRS.

264
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,565
He was an immigrant,
didn't know much English,

265
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,983
even less about withholding tax.

266
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,945
He went bankrupt. Lost his store.

267
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,489
That was the first time
I thought of being a lawyer.

268
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,574
In other words, you're an idealist.

269
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,576
I don't know any tax lawyer
who's an idealist.

270
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,038
When he lost his store, I lost my job,
and it scared me.

271
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,165
- Being out of work?
- No.

272
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,001
What the government
can do to anybody.

273
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,715
What about you?
What led you to law school?

274
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,009
It's so far back
I don't think I can remember.

275
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,178
Sure you can, Counselor.

276
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,724
I used to caddie for young lawyers
off from work on weekdays

277
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,434
and their wives.

278
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:51,439
I'd look at those long tan legs
and just knew I had to be a lawyer.

279
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,151
The wives had long tan legs, too.

280
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,532
Ellis, another martini, please.

281
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,243
So we're not a couple of idealists.

282
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,953
Heaven forbid.

283
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,796
- Hi.
- Hi.

284
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,135
I'll let Mrs. Quinn know you're here.

285
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,436
- Are you sure it's today?
- That's what he told me.

286
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,191
Kay?

287
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,402
There's been...

288
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,531
Marty Kozinski and Joe Hodges
were killed.

289
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,037
We just got word about 20 minutes ago.

290
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,248
Did you meet them at the barbecue?

291
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,833
What happened, Kay?

292
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,419
We're not sure.

293
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,673
They were diving off a boat
on Grand Cayman,

294
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,344
and then there was
some kind of explosion on the boat.

295
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,734
Lamar?

296
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,112
Marty was...

297
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:26,159
His twin girls
are a month older than our son.

298
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,331
I'm very sorry, Lamar.

299
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:40,006
By the way,
Oliver wanted me to tell you,

300
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,719
you shouldn't be burdened
with a student loan.

301
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,431
Excuse me?

302
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:55,897
If you bring the papers by tomorrow,
the Firm will repay it for you.

303
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,082
Kay was scared.

304
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,168
What? No, she was upset.

305
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:20,922
There is a difference between
being upset and being scared.

306
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,882
She was scared.

307
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,136
Of what?
What, do you know her that well?

308
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,304
Maybe not.

309
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,433
But I've spent
a lot of time with her lately.

310
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,980
They have their own horses.

311
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,858
Two of them. Quarter Horses.

312
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,821
Does that make half a horse?

313
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,118
Sorry. I...

314
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,789
...and gently wipe away
every tear from our eyes.

315
00:22:55,374 --> 00:23:00,045
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

316
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,755
Amen.

317
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,298
Let us pray.

318
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:10,221
Lord our God, you are always faithful
and quick to show mercy.

319
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:14,768
Our brother Marty was suddenly
and violently taken from us.

320
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,395
Come swiftly to his aid.

321
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,606
Have mercy on him,

322
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,525
and comfort his family and friends

323
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,488
by the power
and protection of the cross.

324
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:30,116
We ask this through Christ our Lord.
Amen.

325
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,953
Let us go in the peace of Christ.

326
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,917
I'm just gonna go say goodbye to Oliver.

327
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,085
- Okay?
- Okay.

328
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,961
- I'll catch up with you.
- All right.

329
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:50,095
Mrs. McDeere, I'm Avery Tolar.

330
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:57,310
You're the reason I see so little
of my husband these days.

331
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,771
He must be the most ambitious man
in the world.

332
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,022
One of them.

333
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:05,151
No, I mean leaving you every day
just to go off to work.

334
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,948
I'm sure you could manage.

335
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,784
Just tell me how.

336
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,914
Did you know them well?
The men who died?

337
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,332
Yes.

338
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,754
You must be overwhelmed with grief.

339
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:29,384
People grieve in different ways,
Mrs. McDeere.

340
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,144
Abby!

341
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,695
Hey, Hearsay, come here.

342
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:42,624
Shit.

343
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,543
- Is he in?
- Yes, Mr. Tolar.

344
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,087
Hell of a proposal, kiddo.

345
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:51,299
Just redraft this section
on repatriation of offshore funds.

346
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,675
I need it tomorrow.

347
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,803
- Tomorrow? I need another week!
- Can't have it, pal.

348
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,555
You and I are flying to the Caymans
tomorrow morning

349
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,099
to take on Mr. Sonny Capps personally.

350
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,392
But the bar exam!

351
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:04,145
It will be here when you get back, kiddo.

352
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,691
Shall I stay, Mr. McDeere?

353
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,443
Would you like me
to pick you up a sandwich?

354
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,779
No, I'm fine, Nina. Thank you.
You go on home.

355
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,864
- Good night.
- Good night.

356
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:36,219
- So what's good here?
- I'm just having coffee.

357
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,016
I'm going with the steak sandwich.

358
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,810
Two steak sandwiches on rolls, please.

359
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,853
Two steak sandwiches on rolls.

360
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,107
You with Bendini, Lambert & Locke?

361
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,111
Yeah. How did you...

362
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,074
Sorry, I'm just a little...

363
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,326
It looks like
they're working you to death.

364
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,370
They do that with new associates,
I guess.

365
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,623
- I've just been with them now...
- Eight weeks.

366
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:12,255
Sorry, guys. I'm just a little punchy.

367
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,674
That firm looks like a health hazard.

368
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,844
- Hours they make you keep.
- Kind of work they make you do.

369
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,221
Kozinski and Hodges.

370
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,560
Bob Lamm and Alice Krauss.

371
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:30,440
That's four dead lawyers out of 41
in less than 10 years.

372
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,900
And none of them
over the age of what, 45?

373
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:37,530
I mean, that beats the hell out of any life
insurance tables I've ever heard about.

374
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,532
Who are you guys?

375
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,537
Could we get those sandwiches
to go, please?

376
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,458
We'll probably see each other again.

377
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,060
The car wouldn't start.

378
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,442
I got

379
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:43,448
caught in this incredible accident,
12 cars, maybe 13.

380
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:50,288
There was a pregnant woman
in one of them.

381
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,707
I had to help deliver the baby.

382
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,669
It was a girl.

383
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,549
They said
they're gonna name her Abigail.

384
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:07,805
Come on, Abby. Why do you think
I'm working like this, huh?

385
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,891
- 'Cause I want you to have all the stuff...
- Wait a minute.

386
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,893
Wait a minute.

387
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,396
I never asked for anything, Mitch,
except for us to be together.

388
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,564
But I want to give it to you.

389
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,150
I want to give you
everything you gave up to marry me.

390
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,860
Stop it.

391
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,075
It's sweet. I know.

392
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,498
It's some kind of courtship,
but I don't need all that.

393
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,042
Just bring me flowers sometime.

394
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,064
What were you working on all night?

395
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,694
Just, you know, it's...

396
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:08,449
It's just this stuff Avery's got me doing
for the Cayman trip.

397
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,118
Hey, want to have some eggs?

398
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,037
I had some eggs.

399
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,122
Want to have some naked?

400
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,563
You don't even know
what moves me about you, do you?

401
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,317
Mitch, I know what you want,
but it's not for me.

402
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,153
It's not even for you. And you know it.

403
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,911
It's easy for somebody rich
to talk about being poor

404
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:56,914
like it's some fly that's bothering you
and you just wave it away.

405
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,750
This isn't about rich or poor.

406
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:03,254
This is about trying to fix something
that won't get fixed with 10 Mercedes.

407
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,757
Hey, that's not fair, Abby!
That's not fair!

408
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,594
This is about a mother in a trailer park.

409
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,680
And a brother
you pretend you don't have.

410
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,352
Have a nice trip.

411
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,610
Just follow me, and don't over-breathe.

412
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:26,861
What about Sonny Capps?

413
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,362
I thought
we were under a lot of pressure.

414
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,697
We're under tremendous pressure.

415
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,117
If we don't get this dive in
before the bank, we can't do it.

416
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,287
You can't dive
and then fly within 24 hours.

417
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,624
I don't see how you can dive
so soon after the accident.

418
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,043
We don't even know what happened
to Kozinski and Hodges.

419
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,878
Hey, there was a plane crash last week.

420
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,713
We didn't take a boat
to the Caymans, did we?

421
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,218
That's ridiculous, Sonny.

422
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,388
Let us sit down with you
for five minutes. Thank you.

423
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,894
Son of a bitch pays less than 5% tax
and wants to fire us. The Hyatt!

424
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,067
This new plan
is very aggressive, Sonny,

425
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:10,404
and it defers all your tax liability for
years. And you could start right away.

426
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,074
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I can't talk right now.

427
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,078
These taxes are only deferred, right?

428
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:20,915
The future value of the tax dollars will
be less than half their present value.

429
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,250
- Who says?
- After the election...

430
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:26,420
Are you telling me who's gonna be
in the White House the next four years,

431
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,964
'cause that would be
valuable information.

432
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,467
- Well...
- Mr. Tolar has a plan that...

433
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,971
That meets all your needs,
whoever's in the White House.

434
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,474
- Let him tell me.
- He's been trying to.

435
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,018
Hey, who the fuck are you?
His lawyer or mine?

436
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,396
- Neither one, sir.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

437
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,983
Sonny, you're not the Firm's
only concern here.

438
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,613
We put you into deals with other clients

439
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,031
where they may be very sensitive

440
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:57,910
about exposing their relationships
to outside attorneys.

441
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:01,372
You hear that, Counselor?
That's a veiled threat.

442
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,499
If you're talking about our friends
in Chicago,

443
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,251
they don't make money
when I pay you fees.

444
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,545
You make money when I pay you fees.

445
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,672
They make money
being in business with me.

446
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,006
And as long as they're making money,

447
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:13,884
they don't give a flying fuck
who does my taxes.

448
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,429
Hey, you don't know me. I'm a nice guy.

449
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,013
You lose a million bucks for me,

450
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,932
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna break your legs.

451
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,769
Sonny, let's don't get carried away here,
all right?

452
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:27,481
What did I say?

453
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,400
Maybe it's what you didn't say.

454
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:33,195
- "What I didn't say." What didn't I say?
- Thank you.

455
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,030
Mr. Tolar handed you a schedule

456
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:38,826
that virtually guarantees you
zero tax with zero risk.

457
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,537
The basis of your stock would be
the face amount of the installment note,

458
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,705
but the stock would have no value.

459
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,915
Even so,
it's deducted in offsets income.

460
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,711
You defer your tax in full
even though you have a bankable LC.

461
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,213
- Deferred till when?
- What do you care?

462
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:55,384
Whenever it is, it's still the best
interest free loan you'll ever get.

463
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,222
So the worst is,
I pay my taxes much, much later.

464
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,432
No.

465
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,351
The worst thing is next year
they're going to close the loophole,

466
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,520
change the regs and if
you haven't grabbed this proposal,

467
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,938
you're gonna feel like you were fucked

468
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:11,400
with a dick big enough
for an elephant to feel it.

469
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,822
You know that for a fact?

470
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:22,578
Hey, you like the word "protégé"?
I never had one. You ever been one?

471
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,458
I'm A, you're B, right next door.

472
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,668
Avery, who's in Chicago?

473
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:33,047
We'll get to all that.

474
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,425
The hell with it.

475
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,843
Clean up and come on over.

476
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,513
You earned a good dinner
and a night out.

477
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,764
Hey.

478
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,007
I lost my son.

479
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,968
Don't you think
I would have screamed bloody murder

480
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,469
if I thought something was wrong?

481
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:24,014
You're right, Mr. Abanks, I'm sorry.
Okay? You're right. I'm sorry.

482
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,768
Nothing to bury even. Just a stone.

483
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,771
They never did find him
or the other two.

484
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,774
What other two?

485
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,652
The other two who split the charter.

486
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,572
Your friends and two other guys.

487
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,449
- Lawyers?
- They were in swim suits.

488
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:44,743
They paid cash.

489
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,036
Were they American?

490
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:50,958
Could have been anything.
One was, I don't know, squat, heavy.

491
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:56,171
Other guy had long blond hair,
almost white, with weird blue eyes.

492
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,140
- Mitch?
- Yeah.

493
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,184
Grab a Red Stripe out of the fridge.

494
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,020
I'm a little slow.

495
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,608
Take your time.

496
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:20,029
I'm trying to look as pretty as you,
which I'm convinced I can.

497
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,617
It just takes me a little longer.

498
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,161
You got anything to munch on?

499
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,081
Yeah, there's a thing full of stuff
next to the fridge.

500
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:35,169
It's got a lock on it.
Use that key from the ring I gave you.

501
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,846
Do you see it?

502
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,348
Yeah, sure.

503
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,362
You find something?

504
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:12,206
Listen, Capps is a tough guy,
but he's also a blowhard.

505
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,876
He loves to give the impression
that he's connected.

506
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,504
Thinks it's glamorous.

507
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,550
He said a couple of things.

508
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,474
Hey, you're about to take the bar exam.

509
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,394
Here's a multiple choice.

510
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,522
The difference between
tax avoidance and tax evasion is...

511
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:40,484
A, whatever the IRS says.

512
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,488
B, a smart lawyer.

513
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:48,826
C, 10 years in prison.

514
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,495
D, all of the above.

515
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,332
Being a tax lawyer's
got nothing to do with the law.

516
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,084
It's a game.

517
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,003
We teach the rich how to play it,

518
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,713
so they can stay rich.

519
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,091
The IRS keeps changing the rules

520
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:07,094
so we can keep getting rich
teaching them.

521
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,681
It's a game.
One you just played very, very well.

522
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,683
Where's your beer?

523
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,102
I decided to wait for the rum.
I hear it's good down here.

524
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,771
Everything's good down here.
You deserve a taste of all of it.

525
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,207
I think that
since we're here on this island,

526
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:41,211
there's things we can do on it,
you know, primitive things.

527
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,964
Come on, you deserve it.

528
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,222
Look, I don't mean to hurt your feelings,
but this isn't gonna happen.

529
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,475
Would you tell my friend
I went back to the condo?

530
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,227
You don't know what you're missing.

531
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,481
Thanks anyway.

532
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,466
- Leave me alone!
- Listen to me.

533
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,118
Are you all right?

534
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,329
It's okay. Just wait a minute.

535
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,041
Wait a minute.

536
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:04,002
Can I look at this?

537
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,963
You're not a doctor.

538
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,924
No, but I've

539
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,386
sprained a lot of ankles.

540
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,514
Mostly mine.

541
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:25,065
You should ice this.

542
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,526
You should also report that guy.

543
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:36,702
That was your boyfriend.

544
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,582
That was for money.

545
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:56,096
- Aren't you gonna finish?
- I'm sorry.

546
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:03,896
- You think that's...
- Got nothing to do with me.

547
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,405
- Is this too tight?
- No.

548
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,163
I work in a travel agency.

549
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:32,257
I wanted to feel like all those people

550
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:38,138
with first class tickets
and pretty clothes.

551
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,313
I guess I wanted to feel...

552
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,359
Rich.

553
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:04,331
How much would it take to feel rich?

554
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,541
I don't know.

555
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,508
How much would it take to feel safe?

556
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,687
You did that.

557
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,235
You made me feel safe.

558
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:56,049
Hey...

559
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:19,323
Will you stay with me for a while?

560
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,665
Why don't you take the afternoon off?
You deserve it.

561
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,708
Spend it with that pretty wife of yours.

562
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:56,837
Oh, shit, I forgot, she phoned last night.

563
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,840
What'd you tell her?

564
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,717
That you were probably
walking on the beach.

565
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:03,927
I was.

566
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,263
I guessed right then, didn't I?

567
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:15,856
Okay, Mr. McDeere.
If you'll sign where the "X" is

568
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,358
and initial where it's marked.

569
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:43,425
Well, well.
The man from Gentleman's Quarterly.

570
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,595
How you doing, Ray?

571
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:49,389
Pretty fair. How's yourself?

572
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:56,855
It's a long time, huh?

573
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:00,400
It's okay. I've become a patient man.

574
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,116
Don't beat yourself up, kid.

575
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:11,703
If I wasn't here,
I wouldn't want to be here either.

576
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:23,381
- Do you ever talk to Ma?
- A few months ago.

577
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:29,971
- Still with the same guy?
- They're all the same guy.

578
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:39,606
So, you finish law school?

579
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:41,775
Yeah.

580
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,278
That suit's a dead give-away.

581
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,907
What, you get a job on Wall Street?

582
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,910
- You always said...
- No, I'm not. I just...

583
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:57,165
I went with a firm across the river
in Memphis.

584
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,667
Memphis?

585
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,252
Hey, Ray,

586
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:03,880
wouldn't it be funny
if I went to Harvard and you went to jail

587
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,883
and we both ended up
surrounded by crooks?

588
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:13,056
Sonny Capps is thrilled.
McDeere was dazzling.

589
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,725
I think we ought to pull Lamar
out of that tax seminar in Washington

590
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,477
and send Mitch instead.

591
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:20,355
Let him take the jet.
Any problem with that, Bill?

592
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,899
No. No, no problem.

593
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:25,235
So far the kid's been real predictable.

594
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:30,782
If you're even half right, you're gonna
need some help. What does Abby think?

595
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,827
I haven't told her.

596
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,623
I guess...

597
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,961
I guess I don't want it to be real.

598
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,256
Nothing's real until I tell it to Abby.

599
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,761
How did you ever land a job
with a brother in the joint?

600
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,194
That's okay.
I'd have done the same thing myself.

601
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:15,452
You were always around for me, Ray.
All those years after Dad died.

602
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,621
I'd have done the same.

603
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:22,083
You think I'd ever tell guys around here
I got a brother in Harvard?

604
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,211
Jesus, Ray.

605
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,131
Hey, listen.
I want you to see a friend of mine.

606
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,260
His name is Eddie Lomax.
He's a private investigator in Little Rock.

607
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:33,595
Ex-cop.

608
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,264
Anything I can do for you?

609
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:38,475
Sure. Get me out of here.

610
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,854
Where to?

611
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,233
Anywhere I can see a whole lot of sky.

612
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:51,446
I can get through the days,
I even eat the food.

613
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,658
It's amazing
how much you miss the sky.

614
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:08,171
Ever plug one of these in
only you forgot to put the water in?

615
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,381
No.

616
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,967
- Do you know what happens?
- No.

617
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,803
The lights go out.

618
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,185
He's been dying to see you
since you called.

619
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,437
That's what I saw. Tammy!

620
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,191
Mr. Lomax will see you now.

621
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,195
- Mr. McDeere.
- Yes.

622
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,155
I practically went to law school with you.

623
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,784
Ray talked about you
every stinking day for three years.

624
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,619
I was his cellmate,
he must have told you.

625
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:42,038
Did he tell you,
by the way, it was statutory rape?

626
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:45,166
She was 17. Looked 25.
I got one to four.

627
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:48,211
Sit down. Sit down. Come on. Sit down,
sit down. You want some Sweet'N Low?

628
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,379
- You want some dairy cream?
- No.

629
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,922
You want some sugar?
You want some...

630
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,382
Eddie, I've got some business

631
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,050
- I'd like to go over with you here.
- Good. Good. Good.

632
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:55,218
I owe your brother my life.

633
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,721
- I'm leaving.
- Thank you, dear.

634
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,974
That's my secretary. She is terrific.

635
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,810
But she's got a nutcase for a husband.
He's a truck driver.

636
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,770
He moved here
to be close to Graceland.

637
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,147
The reason why, he thinks he's Elvis.

638
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:11,401
What do you think his name is?
It's Elvis. Elvis Aaron Hemphill.

639
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,403
I run across some strange things
in this job.

640
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,781
Some things I'd never spray-paint
on an overpass.

641
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,785
Now, what can I do for you?

642
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:25,957
- What a nice surprise.
- Avery.

643
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:30,587
They didn't have to disturb you.
You didn't have to come down.

644
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,172
Believe me, it's no bother.

645
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,298
I was just looking for Mitch.

646
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:36,634
Nina says
he hasn't been in all afternoon.

647
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,262
I didn't mean for her to call you.

648
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,515
Didn't he come back with you?

649
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,394
I'll be honest with you.
This is not my area of expertise.

650
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:51,232
- But you think it's possible?
- Anything's possible.

651
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:54,569
I'll tell you one thing, if those guys
at the steak joint were feds,

652
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:55,904
you better watch out for them.

653
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:59,032
'Cause they don't give a damn
about you.

654
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,035
I get some pretty pissed off
husbands in here.

655
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:07,624
On the other hand, the lawyers at your
firm sure as hell seem accident prone.

656
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,335
Okay.

657
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,380
I'll see what I can find out.

658
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,717
You better let me call you.

659
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,640
You sure remind me of your brother.

660
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:28,061
Ray comes up for parole in a while.

661
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,981
Says that he can last it.

662
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:34,234
What do you think?

663
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:40,573
There's guys that can do
all the hard time the State gives them.

664
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:43,993
Whatever Ray had,
he used up to get this far.

665
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,754
- Hi.
- Hi.

666
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,466
- I didn't think you were home.
- Why not?

667
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:01,177
- No car.
- I took it in for service.

668
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,097
Avery brought me home.

669
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:09,102
I went to the office looking for you.

670
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,478
I wasn't there.

671
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:13,273
Apparently not.
I even looked under your desk.

672
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,985
- Yeah, I went...
- Avery told me you were at MSU,

673
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,820
at the law library.

674
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,363
- Avery did.
- Avery did.

675
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,782
But when I happened to
spot your car in the parking lot,

676
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,201
it made him kind of edgy.

677
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:28,621
Yeah, well,
Avery didn't exactly know where I was.

678
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,293
Probably thought
you were with another woman.

679
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,509
I went to see Ray.

680
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,721
Ray?

681
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,851
- Yeah.
- Just like that, after all this time?

682
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,979
You were right. I've been stupid.

683
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,234
I would have gone with you on Saturday.

684
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,696
I know. God, I just wasn't...
I wasn't thinking.

685
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:08,745
How'd it go?

686
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:14,834
It was...

687
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:19,422
God, he...
He tried to make it easy for me.

688
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,176
Is he okay?

689
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,305
He's gotta get that parole.

690
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,063
You want to try something?

691
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,940
Let's put the books away,

692
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:40,693
pretend we're back
in our old beat-up apartment, broke,

693
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:43,905
and we find some money
we forgot in pockets.

694
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:49,327
- We'll send out for pizza and drink beer.
- Drink beer.

695
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,498
And watch Star Search.

696
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:57,669
Who knows where it will lead.

697
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,110
Your wife?

698
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:24,737
- She's in Cleveland.
- She lies.

699
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:31,828
Don't you answer your phone?

700
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,831
Don't you knock?

701
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:37,041
Where's your secretary?

702
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,087
Out.

703
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,674
- She left a cigarette burning.
- She does that.

704
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:48,594
Why don't you come back in one hour,
and make an appointment?

705
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,471
Why bother? We're here.

706
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,056
I'm busy.

707
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:54,726
Doing what?

708
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,811
I'm getting a pedicure.

709
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:59,564
What's it to you?

710
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:08,823
Now this is gonna turn out badly for you,

711
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,575
but we can make it relatively painless.

712
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:14,245
Why are you asking questions
about dead lawyers?

713
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,039
What dead lawyers?

714
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,836
Who hired you to do that?

715
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,800
Okay! Okay.

716
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,473
Just let me think.

717
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:38,895
His name was Julio Iglesias.

718
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,025
No! No!

719
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,154
Great!

720
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,823
Just great.

721
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,785
You want to ask him
a few questions now?

722
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:27,360
I think
this is a carefully balanced proposal.

723
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,738
I think it's high-minded
and I think it's fair-minded.

724
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:34,283
In other words, it's got something in it
to offend everyone.

725
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,536
If you want to follow along with me,

726
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,705
we'll begin on page "l"
of the introduction.

727
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:45,419
We'll revue sections 704-B
of the IRS code of 1986

728
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:50,133
and the treasury regulations
amended under Section 1/704-1.

729
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,510
Quote, "The distribution provisions

730
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,929
"in limited and
general partnership agreements."

731
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:59,058
These regulations permit the IRS to
disregard allocations

732
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,060
which are not made in accordance

733
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,396
with partners' interests
in the partnership

734
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,899
unless those allocations
satisfy the economic effect

735
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,860
most easily satisfied

736
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:12,613
by taking advantage of the safe
harbor provisions set forth therein.

737
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:16,159
In other words,
in an ever-changing sea of tax laws...

738
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,043
Hey, brother.

739
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:32,675
Brother, go down the steps
towards the pool.

740
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,844
Here you go, brother.

741
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,431
- Voices from the Wall.
- Thanks a lot.

742
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,640
Oh, yeah.

743
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:40,850
Mister.

744
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:54,822
Who killed Eddie Lomax?

745
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:58,034
Go over and sit next to
the man on the bench.

746
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,096
I appreciate your coming, Mr. McDeere.

747
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,557
I'll call you Mitch, if I may?

748
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,186
My name is Voyles. Denton Voyles.

749
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,854
I'm with the Department of Justice.

750
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:29,232
What happened to Eddie Lomax?

751
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:34,111
We've been investigating
Bendini, Lambert & Locke for four years.

752
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:38,032
No lawyer has ever
left your law firm alive.

753
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,869
Two tried to leave, they were killed.

754
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:45,122
Two were about to try,
you know what happened.

755
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:49,418
Now, we have reason to believe
that your house is bugged.

756
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:53,089
Your phones are tapped,
your office is wired.

757
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:57,885
They may follow you, they may be here
in Washington as we speak.

758
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:04,225
Are you saying my life is in danger?

759
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,520
I'm saying that
your life as you know it is over.

760
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,151
Your law firm
is the sole legal representative

761
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,696
of the Morolto crime family in Chicago.

762
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,990
Known as the Mafia. The Mob.

763
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,576
I don't believe it.

764
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:24,161
They set up legitimate businesses

765
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:27,957
with dirty money from drugs,
gambling, prostitution.

766
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,627
All cash, all moved offshore.
You believe it.

767
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:34,463
That's why you talked
to Thomas Abanks in the Caymans.

768
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,382
That's why you got
this private investigator

769
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,510
asking questions that got him killed.

770
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,473
Maybe 30% of their clients
are legitimate.

771
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,183
They bring in a new rookie,

772
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:50,479
throw money at him,
buy the car, the house.

773
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:54,317
After a couple of years,
and your kids are in private schools,

774
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:57,987
you're used to the good life,
they tell you the truth.

775
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,949
You mean every partner in the Firm is...

776
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:04,535
Every partner knows.

777
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:07,163
We suspect most of the associates.

778
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:16,380
Why don't you get indictments
and bust it all up?

779
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:20,092
We have to have
somebody on the inside.

780
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:23,471
We need to see copies of contracts,
clients' bank records,

781
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,681
- articles of incorporation.
- Wait a minute.

782
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:28,434
- You think I'm...
- You can say no.

783
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,686
But we're gonna break this firm.

784
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:35,066
And when that happens, you're gonna
go to jail along with the rest.

785
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,235
It will happen, son, believe me.

786
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:42,031
Why can't I just leave?

787
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:45,451
That's what Kozinski and Hodges
were trying to do.

788
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:50,122
You have to think this over.

789
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:54,418
Meanwhile, you and your wife have to
behave as though everything is normal.

790
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,964
Now don't discuss this with anyone,

791
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,551
but make a decision.

792
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:06,263
If you help us,
we'll make it worth your while.

793
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:07,973
Worth my while?

794
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,393
You can still have a pretty good life.

795
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:14,146
You mean
in a witness protection program?

796
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:21,445
How? I live somebody else's life?

797
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:25,825
In some nowhere place, and one day
I'm backing out of my driveway

798
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,743
and my car explodes?

799
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,247
Doesn't have to be that way.

800
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:35,584
I don't need much of a life, Mr. Voyles,
but it has to be mine.

801
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:38,254
Is that what you've got now, son?

802
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:44,760
You ought to get back to the seminar.

803
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:48,514
Tarrance has full authority
to negotiate on our behalf.

804
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,768
Why don't you wander back
past the memorial?

805
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:04,447
You can call me in Memphis anytime,
day or night.

806
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:07,032
The second one's a mobile number.

807
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,452
Let me get this straight.

808
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:13,289
I steal files from the Firm
and turn them over to the FBI.

809
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:16,208
Testify against my colleagues,
send them to jail.

810
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:17,376
They suckered you into this.

811
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:20,963
Reveal privileged information that
violates attorney-client confidences,

812
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:24,633
get me disbarred, and then testify
in open court against the Mafia.

813
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:27,970
- Well, unfortunately, Mitch...
- Let me ask you something.

814
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,639
Are you out of your fucking mind?

815
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,642
How long
before they find out Lomax's cellmate

816
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,061
was a guy named Ray McDeere?

817
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,233
And when they do,
what do you think they'll do to him?

818
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,903
They can get to anyone, anywhere.

819
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:46,405
What can you do?

820
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:49,867
Your brother comes up for parole soon,
doesn't he?

821
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:54,705
You cooperate with us,
I'll guarantee the board will be grateful.

822
01:03:55,707 --> 01:04:00,211
Otherwise... Well, you know
what those parole hearings are like.

823
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:03,088
It could go either way.

824
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:33,869
Forget about home, driver.
Take me to the Firm.

825
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:35,955
- The employer will have...
- Mr. McDeere, you can't go in there!

826
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,706
Call everybody. Right now!

827
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:41,043
- I'm on overseas and I've got two...
- Right now!

828
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,128
I just had a little chat with the FBI.

829
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:52,805
- And they didn't try to coerce you?
- No.

830
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:57,977
- They didn't offer you money?
- Nope.

831
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:01,313
Did they ask you to contact them again?

832
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,815
What for?

833
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:07,278
Exactly what did they want?

834
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,823
The secret files.

835
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:18,831
Who had those secret files last?

836
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,249
You have them, Royce?

837
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,501
- I gave them to you.
- No.

838
01:05:23,503 --> 01:05:27,339
They also suggested that Hodges
and Kozinski were murdered.

839
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:32,011
Those sons of bitches!

840
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:38,684
Now, we ought to build a case and sue.
This is pure harassment.

841
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,436
And that was it?

842
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,690
That was everything that was said?

843
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,776
Well, I mean, as far as I can remember.

844
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:50,279
It wasn't exactly
a sequential conversation.

845
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,448
There was a lot of yelling, mostly by me.

846
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:57,119
Mitch, we're always doing battle
with the government.

847
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:01,040
If it isn't the Justice Department,
it's the IRS, and you know what?

848
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,459
We beat them every time.

849
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,961
And they hate us for it.

850
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:09,715
They can't get to us
so they pick on somebody new.

851
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,718
They invite you to break the law.

852
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:16,472
Doesn't cost them anything,
but it costs you everything.

853
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:20,726
Now, I don't want you
to worry about this.

854
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,313
It's gotten serious enough.
We'll have to get into it legally.

855
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:28,567
I guess the only other question is,
who do we bill this hour to?

856
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,739
How about the FBI?

857
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:10,275
I can't believe that. That is so weird.

858
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:13,445
I was just thinking about you.

859
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:17,282
Somebody's burning leaves outside,
did you smell it?

860
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,702
It reminded me of the time...

861
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,208
Hey!

862
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:30,087
If you're afraid you'll wake the kids,
we don't have any.

863
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:48,207
Abby!

864
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:50,125
- Abby!
- Don't say anything! Don't say anything!

865
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,169
Don't tell me any more!

866
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:54,463
Everything.

867
01:08:55,215 --> 01:09:00,052
Every single thing we've said
or done since we've been in that house,

868
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:03,806
nothing has been between us.

869
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:07,309
Can't we just get in our own car
and drive back to Boston, tonight?

870
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,061
- We'll just leave everything.
- They'd find us.

871
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:11,396
How do you go to work tomorrow?
How do you look at Avery?

872
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:12,815
What do you say to him?

873
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,733
I talk about work.

874
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:17,986
- That's insane!
- I have thought of every possible way.

875
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,989
Here, in the Caymans, in Washington,
that's all I've done.

876
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:25,828
Try to think of a way out. If we run,
they'd find us, and it gets Ray killed.

877
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:28,247
- But if you testify...
- The FBI says they'll help Ray

878
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,749
- and protect us.
- Protect what?

879
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:36,421
What are you going to do?

880
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:40,592
Go in tomorrow and start to copy files.

881
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:42,219
I don't have a choice.

882
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,555
Mitch,

883
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:46,682
what are you saying?

884
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,767
You'll be revealing clients' secrets.

885
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,310
- You'll be disbarred.
- Abby, don't...

886
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,105
You'll never be able to practice
law again for the rest of your life.

887
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:56,400
Everything you've worked for!
They can't ask you to do that!

888
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,443
They are not asking!

889
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:10,289
We have to behave
exactly as we have been.

890
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:15,502
We have to go to work
and come home every day

891
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:20,090
and never wonder about the walls
and the wires...

892
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,467
And do nothing we want to do.

893
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,651
Szechwan beef from Wong Boys.

894
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:43,488
That was the last time
I remember laughing.

895
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:47,534
- Come on! Every single day we got...
- Oh, not you again, man.

896
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,411
...one of your trucks out here,
blocking this alley.

897
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,121
- Hey, leave me alone.
- What's it gonna take, huh?

898
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,414
Hey, would you leave me alone, buddy?

899
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,625
You're using this place as a parking lot!

900
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:35,624
What the hell are you doing?

901
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,418
Jesus, I was just trying
to make a copy of...

902
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:43,131
They just started this. You have to have
the billing code for each client.

903
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:45,801
You mean every time
I copy a piece of paper, it's recorded?

904
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:47,594
What are you trying to do, kill yourself?

905
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,389
Come on. Nina should do that anyway.

906
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:54,017
Come down for one night, can't you?

907
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,896
Well, it used to be worth it.

908
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:05,404
Okay. Yeah, maybe next time.

909
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,781
Bye, Cordelia.

910
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,325
That was Cordelia.

911
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,577
Yeah. Your wife.

912
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,329
From the song of the same name.

913
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:17,499
Avery, I have a couple of ideas
about those Capps LCs.

914
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,876
When's the next Cayman trip?

915
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:22,838
For me? Next week.

916
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:26,633
If you think I'm gonna let Sonny Capps
get another look at you, you're crazy.

917
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,301
But you write down
every single thought you have.

918
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:30,762
I'll be happy to take credit.

919
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:37,269
Mr. McDeere! Mr. Mulholland's
called twice about his bills again.

920
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:40,355
Tell Mr. Mulholland to take his bill and...

921
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,733
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Isn't he just up the street?

922
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:44,735
- Yes. In the Cotton Exchange.
- Cotton Exchange.

923
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,862
Tell him I'll see him later.

924
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,865
Did you order a fried egg sandwich
from the Front Street Deli?

925
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,742
A fried egg...

926
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:59,499
Yes, I did. I did.

927
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:02,294
Come in.

928
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:07,591
It's $2.65. The receipt's in the bag.

929
01:13:14,766 --> 01:13:16,808
The receipt's in the bag.

930
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:38,872
How did you see them,
and they didn't see you?

931
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,874
I was under the desk.

932
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:48,882
I was vacuuming the rug.
You want me to draw you a diagram?

933
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,052
I loved him.

934
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,847
I'm sorry, Tammy.

935
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,185
They wanted to know who hired him

936
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:03,730
and why he was asking questions
about dead lawyers.

937
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:10,570
You actually saw them?

938
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:16,868
One guy was stocky,
looked like a wrestler.

939
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:20,205
He's gonna limp the rest of his life

940
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:24,501
'cause Eddie hit him in the knee
with that cannon under his desk.

941
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:28,713
And the other guy was like an albino.

942
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:34,928
Long thin hair, almost white.

943
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:37,222
Dead blue eyes.

944
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,685
My landlady said
they came looking for me yesterday,

945
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:43,478
so I checked into the Motel 6
on River Street.

946
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:46,439
I couldn't think of anywhere else to go.

947
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:53,697
Listen, they're gonna put Eddie
together with Ray, and when they do,

948
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:56,241
it'll lead to you.

949
01:14:57,702 --> 01:15:00,078
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

950
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:02,289
Eddie wouldn't like it.

951
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:05,208
So, you're in as much trouble as I am.

952
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:10,714
Listen, there's a building around
the corner called the Cotton Exchange.

953
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,299
Maybe you can help, Tammy.

954
01:15:16,304 --> 01:15:17,554
Hi there, Mitch.

955
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:20,515
Bill Devasher, Firm Security.

956
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:25,061
Mr. Locke and Mr. Lambert were telling
me about your little run in with the FBI.

957
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,856
I wonder if we could have a little talk.

958
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,941
Actually, I told them everything.

959
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,986
I'm sure you did.
This won't take a minute.

960
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:41,995
Hop in.

961
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:14,653
So, Mitch, this is a debriefing.

962
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,951
I know pretty much
what you told the fellows,

963
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:23,328
so I kind of got the picture.

964
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,289
Now it's my job to give you the picture.

965
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:29,167
What I'm concerned about, son, is this.

966
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:32,128
The FBI wouldn't have come after you
if they didn't figure they'd get to you.

967
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:34,381
What do you suppose
made them think that?

968
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:35,882
I have no idea.

969
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,843
Well, see, it's my job
to have an idea about that.

970
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:42,389
For example, they might know
how important your young wife is to you.

971
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:44,349
They might use that.

972
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:46,685
How?

973
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:51,773
Avery says last Friday
you took the afternoon off.

974
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:55,235
He figures you might have been
with another woman.

975
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:57,487
- Why would Avery think...
- How do you know

976
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,030
you weren't followed?

977
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:07,497
Picture Abby one day
walking to the mail box,

978
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:12,210
anticipating the arrival of her Redbook,
her Sharper lmage catalog.

979
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:15,714
What does she find instead?

980
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,758
She finds heartache, Mitch.

981
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:21,219
The death of love and trust.

982
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:25,056
Imagine her one day opening that.

983
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:27,225
Go ahead. Take a look.

984
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,564
Devastating.

985
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,779
Not just screwing, Mitch.

986
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:45,702
But the kind of intimate acts,
oral and whatnot,

987
01:17:46,746 --> 01:17:50,248
that can be particularly hard
for a trusting young wife to forgive

988
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,459
and impossible to forget.

989
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:03,011
That's just the kind of stuff
the FBI could use for coercion, Mitch.

990
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,096
So you watch yourself.

991
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,808
I'll do the best I can to protect you,

992
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:12,437
and I know you will do your best
to protect the Firm.

993
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:16,983
So if the FBI so much
as spits in your direction,

994
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:20,820
you'll let me know
before it hits the ground, won't you?

995
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:24,491
Won't you, Mitch?

996
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:38,213
Oliver wants to see you right now
in the library. Where you been?

997
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:39,422
Let me just put my coat away.

998
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:41,800
Right now. He's been waiting.

999
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:54,145
You think you're pretty smart, don't you?

1000
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:59,317
Well, we've been informed
there's somebody smarter.

1001
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:05,115
You didn't get the highest score
on the bar exam,

1002
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,784
you got the second-highest score.

1003
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:11,871
Cheers!

1004
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,124
Nice one.

1005
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:17,001
Congratulations.

1006
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,424
They called you, huh?

1007
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:24,467
Guilty, Your Honor.

1008
01:19:24,552 --> 01:19:25,969
I did it.

1009
01:19:26,846 --> 01:19:29,347
Well, it's your moment of glory.

1010
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:35,353
You know, my wife missed mine,
and she never forgave herself.

1011
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:38,314
I wouldn't want that to happen to you.

1012
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:41,025
- That's very considerate, Avery.
- Well, I thought so.

1013
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:43,153
Well done. Well done.

1014
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,196
- Quite an achievement, Mitch.
- Abby.

1015
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:49,534
Well, the space is just great. I'll take it.

1016
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:53,121
- And the lease would be under...
- Greenwood Secretarial Services.

1017
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:54,789
And you are...

1018
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:58,209
- Doris Greenwood. I like that suit a lot.
- Well, thank you.

1019
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,545
They're gonna deliver
a copier tomorrow.

1020
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:03,047
- I'll make sure the office is open.
- All right.

1021
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:15,226
I will employ such means only
as are consistent with truth and honor.

1022
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:20,023
I will maintain the confidence
and preserve inviolate

1023
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:22,442
the secrets of my client.

1024
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:26,821
I will maintain the confidence
and preserve inviolate

1025
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:29,324
the secrets of my client.

1026
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:35,246
I will truly and honestly conduct myself
in the practice of my profession

1027
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:39,876
to the best of my skill and ability,
so help me God.

1028
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:55,934
"I will maintain the confidence
and preserve inviolate

1029
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,102
"the secrets of my client"?

1030
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:03,107
The first thing I'm gonna do
is violate the secrets of my clients.

1031
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:06,277
Do you see any other way?

1032
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:15,578
Okay, then.
Aren't we doing the best we can?

1033
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,459
No.

1034
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:26,256
What do you mean?

1035
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:32,011
I can't.

1036
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:39,769
What?

1037
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,109
That...

1038
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:53,199
That night...

1039
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:57,495
That night in the Caymans
when you telephoned...

1040
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:59,539
You were on the beach.

1041
01:22:09,008 --> 01:22:10,341
What?

1042
01:22:13,012 --> 01:22:14,679
What did you do?

1043
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:21,853
No.

1044
01:22:24,023 --> 01:22:25,523
You didn't...

1045
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,210
Who was she?

1046
01:22:46,337 --> 01:22:48,671
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1047
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,549
I don't even know her name.

1048
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,804
It didn't mean anything.

1049
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:59,891
Like hell it didn't. It means everything.

1050
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:01,726
What did you do?

1051
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:07,482
Why did you fuck some stranger
on a beach one night away from me?

1052
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:08,650
Who does that?

1053
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:10,777
- Abby, I promise you...
- What?

1054
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:16,449
You can't promise anything. Not ever.
Not anymore.

1055
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,745
Why did you tell me?

1056
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:25,083
Because I couldn't stand not to.

1057
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:30,254
I couldn't stand your not knowing.

1058
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:39,389
Well, now I know.

1059
01:23:46,397 --> 01:23:48,106
Give me the keys.

1060
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:50,441
Sorry, I...

1061
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:52,777
Just give me the keys.

1062
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:05,289
I thought
there were only two Brothers Grimm.

1063
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:07,458
Sit down, Avery.

1064
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:10,628
Anthony and Joey
are coming down next week.

1065
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,966
- What for?
- Works out your protégé's got a brother.

1066
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:16,092
So?

1067
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,511
He didn't mention him
at the interview in Boston.

1068
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:20,346
I've got a brother
I might not mention either

1069
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:23,766
- in polite conversation.
- This brother's doing time.

1070
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:25,059
How did you find that out?

1071
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:27,437
What do you think I am here,
a fucking night watchman?

1072
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:29,105
I get confused sometimes.

1073
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:31,649
- Well, don't!
- All right, Avery.

1074
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:37,405
We got a prison guard in Arkansas.
He's on the arm.

1075
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:41,993
He tells us about a Ray McDeere
doing time for manslaughter.

1076
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:45,538
The Moroltos have been edgy ever
since the Kozinski and Hodges mess.

1077
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:48,875
They're concerned that
we might be misreading McDeere.

1078
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,251
And the Moroltos are coming for what?

1079
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,754
- To personally take over?
- Are we misreading him?

1080
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:55,089
I don't think so.

1081
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:59,177
Wouldn't you lie if you had a felon
in the family to get a job like this?

1082
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:02,096
I still think we ought to
keep him on a pretty tight leash.

1083
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:05,641
Why? You've got nothing to be
suspicious about.

1084
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:09,645
I get paid to be suspicious when
I got nothing to be suspicious about.

1085
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,110
Excuse me.

1086
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:54,876
You're not listening, Mr. McDeere.

1087
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,129
I'm sorry. You were talking about hours?

1088
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:03,217
Listen, I know I'm not Bendini-Lambert's
most valuable client,

1089
01:27:03,302 --> 01:27:05,636
but I've got a legitimate complaint here.

1090
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:09,473
You never spent 33 hours last month
on my account.

1091
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:10,892
Is that what you were billed?

1092
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:12,894
You don't see your own bills?

1093
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:16,564
No, I just submit my time sheet.

1094
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:18,065
Where is it?

1095
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,985
It's on file with the office manager.

1096
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:24,739
You know,
this overbilling's gotten so common

1097
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:27,491
nobody gives it another thought.

1098
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,327
It's kind of like tipping.

1099
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:32,330
Well, it's not policy, Mr. Mulholland.

1100
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:36,751
It sure seems like policy.
It's been going on over there for years.

1101
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:40,171
People forget something else, too.

1102
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:45,009
When somebody over there
put a stamp on this and mailed it,

1103
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,677
you know what happened?

1104
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:48,930
- It became a federal offense.
- It became a federal offense.

1105
01:27:49,014 --> 01:27:50,765
You're damn right.

1106
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:53,184
Each instance punishable by...

1107
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,102
$10,000 fine.

1108
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:57,855
Three to five years each instance.

1109
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:24,548
Nina, I'm going over to Mulholland's
for a half hour or so.

1110
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:26,008
All righty.

1111
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,389
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- I got the beeper.

1112
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:33,140
I think there might be
a way of doing this

1113
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:35,559
without getting disbarred
and without breaking the law.

1114
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:38,145
Is that our chief concern here?

1115
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:42,316
Tear those up.
I might not have to use them.

1116
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:45,236
But I got to get to
that stuff in the Caymans.

1117
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,988
What, for the FBI?

1118
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:48,489
No. For me.

1119
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:51,534
They won't let you go, you said.

1120
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:54,328
Somebody's gonna have to get to it
another way.

1121
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:56,372
It has to happen fast.

1122
01:28:57,916 --> 01:29:01,085
I got to figure out what to do about Ray.

1123
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:02,420
What?

1124
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:09,927
In Eddie's stuff, is there some
kind of wireless recording device?

1125
01:29:10,012 --> 01:29:11,345
Yes. Yes!

1126
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,180
You know how to use it?

1127
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:16,017
Whenever Eddie said, "My associate"?
Yours truly.

1128
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,519
Did he have any
high-speed camera equipment?

1129
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:21,856
- Sure.
- I want you to get hold of a van, Tammy.

1130
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:56,474
Hey, Tammy,
did Elvis ever find out about Eddie?

1131
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:00,811
Oh, man. He loved Eddie.
Are you kidding?

1132
01:30:02,814 --> 01:30:05,649
Hell, that stuff was over
between me and Elvis when I was 18.

1133
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,568
We'd been married two years,

1134
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:11,489
and one morning at breakfast
I just turned too old for him.

1135
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:15,409
But I tell you, everybody loves Elvis.
The man's a panda.

1136
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:16,911
And he'd do anything for me.

1137
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:19,914
They're off, and Say Something
comes away on top

1138
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,249
and Right There
is stepping over on the inside.

1139
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:23,834
Champagne Now rushes up...

1140
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:26,253
Doesn't a dog ever get the bone?

1141
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:28,589
Yeah, I hear it happens once in a while.
It's a disaster.

1142
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:31,175
They can never get that dog
to run again.

1143
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:33,594
Listen, Mitch,

1144
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,763
Mr. Voyles wants me to tell you
how much the Bureau appreciates...

1145
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:39,433
A million dollars
in a numbered account in Switzerland.

1146
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:43,437
IBG Bank International in Zurich.

1147
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:46,857
Well, you sure as hell
turned greedy overnight.

1148
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:49,276
And my brother out. Now.

1149
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:52,029
Your brother is a convicted felon, Mitch.

1150
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:55,116
Then get yourself another snitch.

1151
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,867
He's in for manslaughter.

1152
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:58,536
It was a brawl in a bar.

1153
01:30:58,662 --> 01:31:00,955
If he hadn't done any boxing,
it would have been self-defense.

1154
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:02,456
It's still a felony, Mitch.

1155
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:05,042
You heard me, Tarrance.
My brother out now.

1156
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:07,294
And make it a million and a half.

1157
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:09,463
How about you get down on your knees
and kiss my ass

1158
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:11,465
for not indicting you
as a co-conspirator right now,

1159
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,217
you chickenshit
little Harvard cocksucker!

1160
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:14,885
I haven't done anything,
and you know it!

1161
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:16,220
Who gives a fuck? I'm a federal agent.

1162
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:17,888
You know what that means,
you low life motherfucker?

1163
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:19,473
You got no rights. Your life is mine.

1164
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:21,892
I could kick your teeth down your throat,
yank them out your asshole

1165
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:24,395
and I'm not even
violating your civil rights.

1166
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,898
- You are Agent Wayne Tarrance.
- Yeah, you're goddamn right I am!

1167
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:30,317
Maybe local cops can't...

1168
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,744
- Yeah.
- Is this Wayne Tarrance?

1169
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,913
- Who is this?
- Is this Wayne Tarrance?

1170
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:44,331
Yeah, this is Wayne Tarrance.

1171
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:45,916
So is this.

1172
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:47,084
...cocksucker!

1173
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:48,836
I haven't done anything,
and you know it!

1174
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,254
Who gives a fuck? I'm a federal agent.

1175
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:51,755
You know what that means,
you low life motherfucker?

1176
01:31:51,882 --> 01:31:53,340
You got no rights. Your life is mine.

1177
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:55,759
I could kick your teeth down your throat,
yank them out your asshole

1178
01:31:55,886 --> 01:31:58,554
and I'm not even
violating your civil rights.

1179
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:04,518
Now, I think you ought to reconsider.

1180
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:32,546
I think I might have found a way out.

1181
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:39,637
Not out, exactly.
It's more like a way through.

1182
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:46,101
It's a long shot, but it's... Well, it's legal.

1183
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:55,486
I know it's weird, but if we follow
the law, it just might save us.

1184
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:04,245
You don't want to hear the plan.

1185
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,165
Would it change anything between us?

1186
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,087
It's just a plan.

1187
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:17,758
I can't do this anymore.

1188
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:21,095
I can't help you here. I can't help myself.

1189
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:25,683
I've given notice at the school.
I'll leave after the break Wednesday.

1190
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:49,206
You're right. It's better if you go, safer.

1191
01:33:57,882 --> 01:34:00,050
- You have no idea...
- Don't!

1192
01:34:03,722 --> 01:34:07,850
- I love you, Abby.
- Don't you dare, you son of a bitch!

1193
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,740
You want to tell me your plan?

1194
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:24,325
Tomorrow.

1195
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:29,705
Abby, where are you gonna go?

1196
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,419
To my parents, first.
After that, I don't know.

1197
01:34:41,217 --> 01:34:44,928
It might not be safe for you to leave,
unless they know why...

1198
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:48,098
I know. I know.

1199
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:52,853
Somewhere inside,

1200
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:56,106
in the dark,

1201
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:58,442
a Firm is listening.

1202
01:35:04,616 --> 01:35:07,785
Shall we go in now
and do this for the record?

1203
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:24,718
I've made a decision.

1204
01:35:24,803 --> 01:35:28,389
My mother hasn't been well,
she's having some tests.

1205
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:33,310
I want to be there.
We never see each other, anyway.

1206
01:35:33,812 --> 01:35:36,146
And I need some time to think.

1207
01:35:37,607 --> 01:35:40,067
Call Devasher. She's leaving him.

1208
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:46,407
Knock, knock.

1209
01:35:48,284 --> 01:35:49,827
Bad times, huh?

1210
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:54,331
Abby called Kay.

1211
01:35:56,793 --> 01:36:01,004
Listen, all the wives
go a little nuts the first year.

1212
01:36:01,965 --> 01:36:04,174
She'll be back.

1213
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:06,593
Probably want to get pregnant.

1214
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:15,018
Big help, huh?

1215
01:36:15,145 --> 01:36:16,353
You think I'm gonna let this kid

1216
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:18,605
tell us how to run the penal system
in this country?

1217
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:22,359
Sir, it's the only way
he'll give us the files.

1218
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:24,778
Then stall on the money.

1219
01:36:24,863 --> 01:36:27,030
Get the brother out
with a federal subpoena.

1220
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:30,951
Follow him and the minute
we get the files, yank him back.

1221
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:36,874
Abanks' Dive Lodge.

1222
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:40,210
Mr. Thomas Abanks, please.
This is Mitch McDeere.

1223
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:04,651
Sorry, Dutch, but I've got to justify
a client's bill before a breakfast meeting

1224
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:08,238
and all the time sheets and bills are
locked up in the office manager's office.

1225
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:09,907
I don't know if I'm really supposed
to do this for you.

1226
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:11,909
Hey, you want to wake up Avery?

1227
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:17,080
I'm just trying to head off
a legal action against us.

1228
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:21,919
I promise, I'll have everything back
in the drawer before the office opens.

1229
01:37:53,034 --> 01:37:55,452
You're taller than I thought.

1230
01:37:55,537 --> 01:37:57,955
That's nice to hear.

1231
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:00,415
There's been a change of plan.

1232
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:03,710
I didn't know there was a plan.

1233
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:06,255
Good, because it's been changed.

1234
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:08,966
Who are you, sweetheart?

1235
01:38:15,056 --> 01:38:16,640
Abanks' Diving Lodge.

1236
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:18,642
What time
has Avery chartered the boat for?

1237
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:20,060
2:30.

1238
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:24,231
Okay, now, you got to keep him out long
enough to copy everything in that closet.

1239
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:26,483
Don't worry. My friends are taking him
to Trinity Caves.

1240
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:28,569
- It should be a good six hours.
- Okay.

1241
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:31,822
Tammy's coming down tomorrow
to set things up.

1242
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,463
I can... I can whip us up some eggs.

1243
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:53,010
Last day,
I don't want to be late for school.

1244
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:02,269
Has Tammy left to meet Abanks?

1245
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:04,354
Not until this evening.

1246
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:10,777
You're running a real 3-ring circus,
aren't you?

1247
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:15,949
- I hope it goes well.
- It has to.

1248
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:22,873
You know, isn't it amazing?

1249
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:27,794
You did the cheating,
and I'm the one who feels guilty.

1250
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:29,129
Don't.

1251
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:40,515
Take care of yourself.

1252
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,233
Hey! Hey! Stop that!

1253
01:39:50,318 --> 01:39:51,401
Where are your gloves?

1254
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:54,821
Get back to the dodge ball game.
You, too, Sheila.

1255
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:09,211
Boys and girls together,
rehearsing for later life.

1256
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:11,421
What are you doing here?

1257
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:14,174
Would you believe I just happened to be
in the neighborhood?

1258
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:15,425
No.

1259
01:40:16,594 --> 01:40:19,012
I heard this was your last day.

1260
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:21,682
Was I misinformed?

1261
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:25,018
I'll be gone for a while.

1262
01:40:25,103 --> 01:40:27,854
I just stopped off to say goodbye.

1263
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:30,273
- Just in case.
- In case what?

1264
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:34,194
In case it's more than a while.

1265
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:38,573
I'm going to the Caymans tomorrow,
and I would miss saying goodbye.

1266
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:43,370
Well, thank you. Have a nice trip.

1267
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:44,788
Want to come?

1268
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:49,626
I know. I know, it sounds outrageous,

1269
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:51,586
but think about it.

1270
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:58,051
We could grab some sun, take a dip,
drink some Havana Club.

1271
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:02,639
I could give you marital advice
and hit on you,

1272
01:41:03,725 --> 01:41:07,310
and whatever happens,
I promise I take rejection well.

1273
01:41:09,147 --> 01:41:11,481
What makes you think
I need marital advice?

1274
01:41:11,607 --> 01:41:14,109
Okay, you give me marital advice.

1275
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,405
I couldn't possibly.

1276
01:41:19,782 --> 01:41:23,577
- I don't scuba dive.
- Perfect. I can't scuba dive either.

1277
01:41:23,661 --> 01:41:24,995
Really?

1278
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:28,331
I'd heard that
you don't miss a chance to...

1279
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:29,833
Not this time.

1280
01:41:29,959 --> 01:41:32,753
I had to shorten the trip,
clients coming into town.

1281
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:36,423
I can't dive and fly in the same 24 hours.
So, you see?

1282
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:39,342
How about it?

1283
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:42,846
My mother isn't well.

1284
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:46,516
They're doing some tests.

1285
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:49,686
That's why I'm going home.

1286
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:52,147
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

1287
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:55,108
How could you possibly?

1288
01:41:56,360 --> 01:42:01,323
I hope she feels better,
and if she does, bring her with you.

1289
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:08,038
Goodbye, Avery. Have a good flight.

1290
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:19,382
Greenwood Secretarial Services.

1291
01:42:19,509 --> 01:42:22,719
Tammy, this is Abby McDeere.
I think you've got a serious problem.

1292
01:42:22,804 --> 01:42:24,846
Avery's not going diving.

1293
01:42:26,724 --> 01:42:28,225
We're dead.

1294
01:42:31,229 --> 01:42:33,230
Well, how do we...

1295
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:37,901
How am I gonna tell Mitch?
How am I gonna let him know?

1296
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:49,329
I'm going anyway.
I've got to try to do something.

1297
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:51,873
My flight's in three hours.

1298
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,257
Mr. McDeere's office.

1299
01:43:00,883 --> 01:43:02,759
I'm sorry, he's not in.
May I take a message?

1300
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:22,612
Tammy, don't tell Mitch anything.

1301
01:43:26,784 --> 01:43:28,702
I'll just be a sec.

1302
01:43:30,121 --> 01:43:32,747
A prescription for Abigail McDeere.

1303
01:43:49,307 --> 01:43:50,640
One!

1304
01:43:54,061 --> 01:43:57,147
Well, you want to go,
or do you want to stay here?

1305
01:43:57,231 --> 01:44:00,650
- Aren't you gonna cuff him?
- I'll take care of it.

1306
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:14,247
Yeah?

1307
01:44:14,332 --> 01:44:16,499
Guess what I'm looking at?

1308
01:44:17,919 --> 01:44:19,252
Tell me.

1309
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:22,339
My first sunset in six years.

1310
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:26,343
- You made it.
- Yeah.

1311
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:29,262
Yeah, I did.

1312
01:44:29,347 --> 01:44:31,514
I owe you, little brother.

1313
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:34,935
No, you don't.

1314
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:41,024
- Anything from Abanks?
- Last I heard, everything was set.

1315
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:43,944
It's gonna be fine.

1316
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:46,863
It already is.

1317
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:52,285
I'll be seeing you, Ray.

1318
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:56,790
Okay, you spoke to him.
Now, where are the files?

1319
01:44:56,874 --> 01:44:58,124
Where's the money?

1320
01:44:58,209 --> 01:44:59,709
Not until I get the files.

1321
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:01,544
You send half now.

1322
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:05,799
Account number 6194408S.
You got that?

1323
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:10,387
Yeah. 6194408S, yeah.

1324
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:14,975
When I get confirmation it's there,
I'll send the files.

1325
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:25,568
Here's some pocket money.

1326
01:45:25,695 --> 01:45:29,322
You're free, McDeere.
There's a bus stop a quarter mile.

1327
01:45:29,407 --> 01:45:32,409
Follow the yellow line.
You're used to that.

1328
01:46:19,165 --> 01:46:20,832
Excuse me.

1329
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:42,187
You don't seem that surprised.

1330
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:44,189
I'm deeply surprised.

1331
01:46:46,067 --> 01:46:47,358
So am I.

1332
01:46:59,538 --> 01:47:01,664
Stephanie, could we have
two Havana Club, please?

1333
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:03,333
Yes, Mr. Tolar.

1334
01:47:18,015 --> 01:47:20,350
How'd the test turn out?

1335
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:23,061
We were worried for no reason.

1336
01:47:23,187 --> 01:47:24,354
Good.

1337
01:47:26,524 --> 01:47:30,193
I didn't think we'd got on that well
in the school yard.

1338
01:47:31,695 --> 01:47:34,280
Maybe I've grown up since then.

1339
01:47:34,365 --> 01:47:36,449
I'd love to believe that.

1340
01:47:55,553 --> 01:47:57,887
- It's delicious.
- Isn't it?

1341
01:47:57,972 --> 01:47:59,722
It's like cognac.

1342
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,394
You know, I have a very bad reputation.

1343
01:48:07,773 --> 01:48:10,150
- What do you do?
- I run around.

1344
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:13,278
Why do you do that?

1345
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:19,242
I think it's because
my wife understands me.

1346
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:26,416
The fact is, I love my wife.

1347
01:48:30,421 --> 01:48:34,090
But she's... Well,
I guess she's lost interest in me.

1348
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,426
I know I have.

1349
01:48:40,306 --> 01:48:43,683
And I haven't cared for anyone since.

1350
01:48:46,604 --> 01:48:48,438
I'd like to, though.

1351
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:51,191
I miss it.

1352
01:48:56,864 --> 01:48:59,991
My, you lay a lot on a girl for a first date.

1353
01:49:01,619 --> 01:49:03,453
Is that what this is?

1354
01:49:12,713 --> 01:49:13,755
This is Unit B.

1355
01:49:13,839 --> 01:49:17,884
We'll be pulling into Five Points
at 11: 15 for a 20-minute rest stop.

1356
01:49:17,968 --> 01:49:19,969
Mrs. Sunderland,
I'm sorry to call you at home so late,

1357
01:49:20,054 --> 01:49:23,056
but I need to speak to you
about something that's, well,

1358
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:24,682
it's really quite embarrassing.

1359
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:27,352
Let me preface this by saying
you're not the only client at the Firm

1360
01:49:27,478 --> 01:49:28,561
that I've had to call about this.

1361
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:43,886
I'd like a big steak, medium rare,
three fried eggs over,

1362
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:46,389
French fries and coffee, please.

1363
01:50:50,894 --> 01:50:53,479
I'll see you, darling.

1364
01:52:03,092 --> 01:52:04,467
Fuck!

1365
01:52:21,527 --> 01:52:23,945
What the hell is going on?
We lost your brother.

1366
01:52:24,029 --> 01:52:26,197
Why, were you following him?

1367
01:52:26,323 --> 01:52:28,282
Are you trying to fuck with me?

1368
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:29,784
Where are you? Where are those files?

1369
01:52:29,868 --> 01:52:33,329
Are you trying to fuck with me?
You want the files, you wire the money.

1370
01:52:33,455 --> 01:52:34,997
I want those files now.

1371
01:52:35,124 --> 01:52:36,958
Got to go, Wayne.

1372
01:52:39,336 --> 01:52:42,130
He knows exactly where his brother is.

1373
01:52:43,215 --> 01:52:44,715
Have them check all the credit cards

1374
01:52:44,842 --> 01:52:48,386
of everybody that got fuel outside
that diner between 11:00 and 11:45,

1375
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:50,763
whenever we lost Ray.

1376
01:52:50,848 --> 01:52:52,140
There couldn't be
more than a dozen or so.

1377
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,142
He's got to be on one of them.

1378
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:56,561
And get me a map of Louisiana.

1379
01:52:58,355 --> 01:53:00,356
Get me a map of Louisiana!

1380
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:40,563
It hasn't even begun to melt.

1381
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:44,108
The staff was chosen for its timing.

1382
01:54:35,577 --> 01:54:38,496
I would do that,
but I could never do that.

1383
01:54:39,957 --> 01:54:42,124
The buttons are too small.

1384
01:54:44,086 --> 01:54:46,587
It requires terrible...

1385
01:54:46,672 --> 01:54:48,172
Dexterity.

1386
01:54:50,926 --> 01:54:52,635
Amazing.

1387
01:55:04,481 --> 01:55:06,107
What are you doing here?

1388
01:55:06,191 --> 01:55:07,817
What do you mean?

1389
01:55:07,943 --> 01:55:10,570
I mean,
exactly what did you come here for?

1390
01:55:10,654 --> 01:55:12,822
I thought I was invited.

1391
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:15,366
You're not being truthful.

1392
01:55:17,494 --> 01:55:19,996
Why are you doing this?

1393
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:25,042
Because I'm sick
and I want you to tell me the truth.

1394
01:55:27,004 --> 01:55:31,173
I came here to punish Mitch
for letting the Firm ruin our lives.

1395
01:55:32,509 --> 01:55:36,137
I came because when Mitch was here
with you he slept with someone else.

1396
01:55:36,221 --> 01:55:38,556
Is that what you want to hear?

1397
01:55:44,688 --> 01:55:47,315
That's better than the alternative.

1398
01:55:48,025 --> 01:55:49,775
What alternative?

1399
01:55:50,819 --> 01:55:53,154
That you came here to see me.

1400
01:56:21,224 --> 01:56:22,475
Avery?

1401
01:56:57,678 --> 01:56:59,929
It came in about three hours ago.

1402
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:01,681
You sure he'll be all right?

1403
01:57:01,765 --> 01:57:03,933
What the hell you want to do? Call 911?

1404
01:57:04,017 --> 01:57:07,520
Get the key,
grab the stuff and get over here.

1405
01:57:07,604 --> 01:57:09,105
Keep calling him.

1406
01:57:09,189 --> 01:57:12,274
Wake the son of a bitch up. When you
get him on the phone, find me.

1407
01:57:12,401 --> 01:57:13,442
I want that girl.

1408
01:57:19,282 --> 01:57:23,536
The account number is 6194408S.

1409
01:57:25,122 --> 01:57:28,457
And can you confirm that it is $750,000?

1410
01:57:49,146 --> 01:57:52,273
Absolutely. I'm fixing
to get out of here now.

1411
01:57:53,066 --> 01:57:54,567
You got all the information I need?

1412
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:57,903
Yeah, but, Mitch...

1413
01:57:57,988 --> 01:58:02,158
I've been looking at this stuff
and there's no numbers listed.

1414
01:58:02,242 --> 01:58:04,493
There's no numbers? No amounts?

1415
01:58:04,578 --> 01:58:06,579
No, I got papers
for bank accounts everywhere

1416
01:58:06,663 --> 01:58:10,166
from the Caymans to Hong Kong,
but there's no amounts.

1417
01:58:12,127 --> 01:58:14,587
I can't play the poker game
I'm gonna play and bluff.

1418
01:58:14,671 --> 01:58:17,173
I gotta know
how much they have and where.

1419
01:58:17,257 --> 01:58:20,176
There's a note on each one that says,

1420
01:58:21,011 --> 01:58:24,513
"Info held by client and my Mac.
Signed A.T."

1421
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:27,516
Is there any other information?
Is there a password?

1422
01:58:27,642 --> 01:58:30,019
Some kind of password?
Just look on the paper, Tammy.

1423
01:58:30,103 --> 01:58:31,771
Wait a minute.

1424
01:58:31,855 --> 01:58:35,107
On the side of one,
in parenthesis it says,

1425
01:58:35,192 --> 01:58:39,695
"R-E-F," then a colon, then, "Cordelia."

1426
01:58:40,447 --> 01:58:43,365
Okay, okay, I've got to get to Avery's
computer in the morning before I leave.

1427
01:58:43,492 --> 01:58:44,784
Well, listen, be careful.

1428
01:58:44,868 --> 01:58:47,286
We don't know how this is
all gonna look in the morning.

1429
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:49,538
I should be able
to get through the morning fine.

1430
01:58:49,664 --> 01:58:52,374
By the time they notice I'm not
back from lunch, I'll be in Chicago.

1431
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:03,636
Okay. We're finished. That's it.
I gotta get these out to the boat.

1432
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:05,346
The boat?

1433
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:07,973
- What boat?
- Oh, man.

1434
01:59:09,351 --> 01:59:11,977
Later on there's some stuff I gotta
tell you about what Mitch is doing.

1435
01:59:12,062 --> 01:59:13,395
Tell me now, Tammy. What?

1436
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:16,649
Get the damn keys back in his pants
and get out of there before he wakes up.

1437
01:59:36,253 --> 01:59:37,795
Hello?

1438
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:44,552
You have to repeat that.

1439
01:59:48,849 --> 01:59:50,266
That's not possible.

1440
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:53,352
She stole your keys
and God knows what else.

1441
01:59:53,979 --> 01:59:56,063
Now who the hell is she?

1442
01:59:56,147 --> 01:59:59,108
You know me,

1443
01:59:59,192 --> 02:00:01,485
just somebody I met last night.

1444
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:04,280
Then how the hell does she know
to go after your keys?

1445
02:00:04,364 --> 02:00:07,950
The guys will be landing in about
10 minutes and she better be there.

1446
02:00:40,734 --> 02:00:41,942
Don't.

1447
02:00:44,154 --> 02:00:46,405
They heard you on the phone.

1448
02:00:50,994 --> 02:00:52,620
Mitch sent you.

1449
02:00:57,584 --> 02:00:59,835
I knew he was a closet idealist.

1450
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:02,004
He doesn't know I'm here.

1451
02:01:03,965 --> 02:01:06,050
But I did do it for him.

1452
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:09,887
That's even better
than getting even with him.

1453
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:14,266
You gotta get out of here.

1454
02:01:21,358 --> 02:01:23,067
What are you going to do?

1455
02:01:23,151 --> 02:01:25,527
Abby, the girl was a set-up.

1456
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:29,698
On the beach, she was a set-up.

1457
02:01:32,661 --> 02:01:34,787
They do things like that.

1458
02:01:35,455 --> 02:01:38,582
Just in case
the usual inducements don't work.

1459
02:01:41,044 --> 02:01:44,129
What's going to happen?
What are they going to do to you?

1460
02:01:44,214 --> 02:01:46,173
Whatever it is...

1461
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:50,803
They did it a long time ago.

1462
02:01:52,681 --> 02:01:54,014
Get this thing out of here, will you?

1463
02:01:54,099 --> 02:01:56,308
Look, this ain't your cotton truck,
and this ain't your alley!

1464
02:01:56,393 --> 02:01:58,602
I'm calling in to
the Department of Traffic right now!

1465
02:01:58,687 --> 02:01:59,895
They call?

1466
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:01,438
Not yet.

1467
02:02:05,652 --> 02:02:07,528
Madge, I just talked to Avery
in the Caymans.

1468
02:02:07,612 --> 02:02:09,780
He needs some work done
on the Kemmer papers before 10:00.

1469
02:02:09,864 --> 02:02:12,032
I'll just get it off his computer.

1470
02:02:17,163 --> 02:02:18,414
What the hell's
the matter with you guys?

1471
02:02:18,498 --> 02:02:20,666
This thing's out of paper.

1472
02:02:37,976 --> 02:02:39,351
McDeere in yet?

1473
02:02:39,436 --> 02:02:41,729
Check every goddamn floor
and find him.

1474
02:02:41,813 --> 02:02:43,522
That son of a bitch cut a deal.

1475
02:02:53,158 --> 02:02:57,995
- Natisin, Earlywine, Hemphill.
- Hemphill?

1476
02:02:58,455 --> 02:02:59,788
Wait a minute.
That's Lomax's secretary.

1477
02:02:59,873 --> 02:03:03,000
Wayne, it's Warden Dynehart
from Wrightsville prison.

1478
02:03:04,169 --> 02:03:06,712
Wayne, we've got a problem here.
I've just been questioning a guard

1479
02:03:06,796 --> 02:03:09,465
who sent an unauthorized fax
to a law firm in Memphis

1480
02:03:09,549 --> 02:03:11,508
and I think
it was in regard to your prisoner.

1481
02:03:11,593 --> 02:03:14,470
No! No, no, no, no!

1482
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:26,648
No, he's not in his office, Your Honor.
I'll see if he's in the building.

1483
02:03:31,654 --> 02:03:33,113
- Thank you, Madge.
- You're welcome.

1484
02:03:33,198 --> 02:03:34,573
Mitch...

1485
02:03:35,867 --> 02:03:38,285
We've just been looking for you.

1486
02:03:39,662 --> 02:03:41,955
Can you step in here, please?

1487
02:03:43,249 --> 02:03:47,836
Mr. Tolar's office. Yes, he's right here.
Nina, transfer him.

1488
02:03:47,921 --> 02:03:51,507
Mr. McDeere, a Judge Tarrance for you.

1489
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:54,134
One moment please.

1490
02:04:08,108 --> 02:04:09,358
Hello?

1491
02:04:09,442 --> 02:04:12,152
Get out of there. They know. Get out.

1492
02:04:13,488 --> 02:04:17,658
Did you hear what I said?
Get out of there and get over here now.

1493
02:04:21,037 --> 02:04:22,663
Can you?

1494
02:04:25,291 --> 02:04:26,792
I understand.

1495
02:04:31,047 --> 02:04:32,464
Come on.

1496
02:04:36,427 --> 02:04:39,972
He ain't going nowhere.
Rudy, get to the front door.

1497
02:04:52,652 --> 02:04:56,321
Mitch, what can I do you for?
Have a seat.

1498
02:05:10,336 --> 02:05:12,838
Okay, Rudy,
he's headed east up the alley.

1499
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:15,799
Get him and hold him.

1500
02:05:21,431 --> 02:05:23,182
God damn it.
I knew they wouldn't find her.

1501
02:05:23,266 --> 02:05:26,602
Now, I need him here now,
so you get him back on that plane.

1502
02:05:27,937 --> 02:05:30,898
If we don't get McDeere before
he gives what he got to the feds...

1503
02:05:30,982 --> 02:05:32,232
Well, what direction was he running?

1504
02:05:32,317 --> 02:05:33,358
- Wayne...
- Just a minute.

1505
02:05:33,443 --> 02:05:34,985
It's McDeere!

1506
02:05:36,946 --> 02:05:38,280
Where are you?

1507
02:05:38,364 --> 02:05:39,990
Never mind. What happened?

1508
02:05:40,074 --> 02:05:43,076
Look. It's okay. I'll send you a car.

1509
02:05:43,161 --> 02:05:45,078
You just come on in.
I'll tell you when you get here.

1510
02:05:45,163 --> 02:05:47,247
No, you tell me now!

1511
02:05:47,332 --> 02:05:49,875
Mitch, it was a prison guard.

1512
02:05:49,959 --> 02:05:51,501
You just come on in.

1513
02:05:51,586 --> 02:05:53,712
Come on in and we'll place you
in protective custody.

1514
02:05:53,796 --> 02:05:55,631
Somehow you don't
make me feel protected.

1515
02:05:55,715 --> 02:05:58,091
Are you looking to get whacked?
Do you know what's going on here?

1516
02:05:58,176 --> 02:05:59,843
The Moroltos are arriving today.

1517
02:05:59,928 --> 02:06:01,470
- From Chicago.
- What?

1518
02:06:01,554 --> 02:06:03,513
I got their itinerary right in front of me.

1519
02:06:03,598 --> 02:06:06,016
The Moroltos are coming here,
Memphis, this afternoon.

1520
02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:09,269
I got the itinerary right in front of me.
Northwest, arrives 2: 16 p.m.

1521
02:06:09,354 --> 02:06:10,729
Straight to the Peabody.

1522
02:06:10,813 --> 02:06:13,273
Now, listen to me, the whole goddamn
world is gonna be looking for you.

1523
02:06:13,358 --> 02:06:16,944
You can't go home, you can't go
back there, so get in here. Now!

1524
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:25,369
I've got to get lost for a few hours.

1525
02:06:25,453 --> 02:06:27,162
There's something I gotta do.

1526
02:06:27,247 --> 02:06:28,538
Where the hell are the files, Mitch?

1527
02:06:28,623 --> 02:06:31,083
You'll get instructions.

1528
02:06:31,167 --> 02:06:32,960
- After.
- After what?

1529
02:06:40,134 --> 02:06:41,551
He's withholding evidence.

1530
02:06:41,636 --> 02:06:44,221
He's got three quarters
of a million dollars of our money.

1531
02:06:44,305 --> 02:06:47,057
He's a fugitive. I want him brought in.

1532
02:06:47,141 --> 02:06:50,269
Use the Memphis police if you have to,
but get him.

1533
02:06:50,353 --> 02:06:54,356
It's a red KW 10-ton registered
to a Farley's Catfish Farm.

1534
02:06:55,441 --> 02:06:58,068
Get its routes and find that truck.

1535
02:06:58,152 --> 02:07:00,904
And issue APBs
on Ray and Mitchell McDeere.

1536
02:07:19,048 --> 02:07:22,968
During the great steamboat era,
which was at its height in the 1870s,

1537
02:07:23,052 --> 02:07:25,762
these great floating palaces,
like the Robert E. Lee,

1538
02:07:25,847 --> 02:07:28,598
whose model you see here,
numbered by the hundreds

1539
02:07:28,683 --> 02:07:30,225
on the Mississippi River.

1540
02:07:30,310 --> 02:07:32,728
The Robert E. Lee
was actually designed specifically

1541
02:07:32,812 --> 02:07:35,856
to travel on the Mississippi River,
which is a shallow river...

1542
02:07:40,278 --> 02:07:43,905
Follow me now to the main deck of the
boat where the cargo would be carried

1543
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:45,782
as well as the deck passengers.

1544
02:07:45,867 --> 02:07:48,243
The great rollers
that powered the steam engine

1545
02:07:48,328 --> 02:07:50,746
were situated here
on the main deck of the boat.

1546
02:07:50,830 --> 02:07:52,789
Hey, Mitch. Mitch!

1547
02:07:52,874 --> 02:07:56,293
The end of the great steam era
and the advent of the railway.

1548
02:07:56,377 --> 02:07:58,211
The next gallery detailing...

1549
02:08:01,466 --> 02:08:05,260
We have here the working steam engine
off the US Army Corps of Engineers

1550
02:08:05,345 --> 02:08:07,262
snag boat, the Arkansas II.

1551
02:08:07,347 --> 02:08:08,764
Now a steam engine works

1552
02:08:08,848 --> 02:08:12,434
by lighting a fire underneath the boilers
where the water is contained.

1553
02:08:12,518 --> 02:08:14,811
This heats the water
and turns it into steam.

1554
02:08:14,896 --> 02:08:17,898
Because the kids wanted me
to bring them by.

1555
02:08:18,483 --> 02:08:20,734
Why, what's the matter?

1556
02:08:20,818 --> 02:08:24,529
Okay. Oh, Lamar, I just saw Mitch
at Mud Island Museum.

1557
02:08:24,614 --> 02:08:26,448
He was zipping through like a tourist.

1558
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:28,116
I waved to him but he didn't see me.

1559
02:09:02,151 --> 02:09:07,280
Northwest Airlines Flight 264
arriving from Chicago,

1560
02:09:07,365 --> 02:09:10,826
Gate B-1, main concourse.

1561
02:09:15,706 --> 02:09:16,748
- Devasher.
- Sir,

1562
02:09:16,833 --> 02:09:18,542
they spotted McDeere on Mud Island.

1563
02:09:18,668 --> 02:09:20,544
Get the boys over there, right away!

1564
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:22,421
I'm on my way.

1565
02:09:25,049 --> 02:09:28,427
Okay. Let's get these below
with the rest of them.

1566
02:09:31,848 --> 02:09:34,433
- Abanks' Diving Lodge.
- How are my friends?

1567
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:36,726
Okay.

1568
02:09:38,438 --> 02:09:41,940
Your brother's on the plane and
Tammy's loading the ship now.

1569
02:09:44,694 --> 02:09:46,236
It worked out.

1570
02:09:47,864 --> 02:09:50,073
Your lawyer friend is dead.

1571
02:09:51,117 --> 02:09:54,578
He never was on the boat.
He canceled the charter.

1572
02:09:56,706 --> 02:09:58,832
- Well, how did...
- He drowned.

1573
02:09:58,916 --> 02:10:01,960
In his bathtub. After the lady left.

1574
02:10:02,044 --> 02:10:03,962
Didn't Tammy tell you?

1575
02:10:05,423 --> 02:10:07,048
What lady?

1576
02:10:08,217 --> 02:10:10,343
- How did you get...
- I don't know.

1577
02:10:10,428 --> 02:10:13,847
A lady friend of Tammy's slipped him
some kind of Mickey Finn.

1578
02:10:13,931 --> 02:10:15,891
I think it was somebody he knew.

1579
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:20,562
What are you talking about?
What lady friend?

1580
02:10:20,646 --> 02:10:21,813
Wait a minute.

1581
02:10:21,898 --> 02:10:25,901
Mitch is asking about your friend Abby.
Isn't that her name?

1582
02:11:06,234 --> 02:11:07,526
Hey!

1583
02:12:11,048 --> 02:12:12,507
Excuse me.

1584
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:02,867
Come here.

1585
02:14:02,952 --> 02:14:06,037
He's in that first door.
I'm going around the front.

1586
02:16:54,290 --> 02:16:57,584
You sick son of a bitch!

1587
02:17:29,033 --> 02:17:31,534
Well, of course I can talk.
Why, isn't that what I'm doing?

1588
02:17:31,660 --> 02:17:33,870
I mean, if it's something else,
please advise me, Maury.

1589
02:17:33,996 --> 02:17:37,040
I always like to learn something
I don't know at $500 an hour.

1590
02:17:37,166 --> 02:17:39,584
I swear to you, Joey, every fucking
lawyer on the face of the earth

1591
02:17:39,668 --> 02:17:41,252
ought to be killed.

1592
02:17:41,337 --> 02:17:44,380
You want to what?
You want to meet with McDeere?

1593
02:17:44,506 --> 02:17:47,759
For what? So the two of you can get
together and charge me $1,000 an hour

1594
02:17:47,843 --> 02:17:49,928
while they send me to Joliet
for 30 years?

1595
02:17:50,012 --> 02:17:51,638
Stay in Chicago, Maury.

1596
02:17:51,722 --> 02:17:54,223
This kid's cut a deal
and I bet it's a beaut.

1597
02:17:54,350 --> 02:17:57,143
If I get my hands on this fucking kid,
Joey, if I get my hands on this kid...

1598
02:17:57,227 --> 02:17:59,020
- Excuse me.
- Not now, Ruthie.

1599
02:17:59,104 --> 02:18:01,397
I think it's urgent, Mr. Morolto.

1600
02:18:01,523 --> 02:18:03,107
Ruthie thinks it's urgent.
What do you think, Joey?

1601
02:18:03,192 --> 02:18:05,026
It's a Mr. McDeere.

1602
02:18:05,694 --> 02:18:07,528
Mr. Mitchell McDeere.

1603
02:18:08,864 --> 02:18:10,907
He's waiting to see you.

1604
02:18:12,743 --> 02:18:14,744
I think Ruth is right.

1605
02:18:39,395 --> 02:18:40,853
I'm Mitch McDeere.

1606
02:18:42,731 --> 02:18:45,024
I'm your attorney.

1607
02:18:45,776 --> 02:18:47,694
One of them, anyway.

1608
02:18:48,696 --> 02:18:52,573
I assume you knew,
but I thought I'd mention it, in case.

1609
02:18:55,202 --> 02:18:58,121
- Would you care to sit down?
- Not really.

1610
02:18:59,581 --> 02:19:02,709
I want to try and...

1611
02:19:06,755 --> 02:19:10,717
This is just... This is very awkward.

1612
02:19:13,262 --> 02:19:17,515
I'm afraid my firm has behaved

1613
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:19,976
in an unethical manner.

1614
02:19:21,979 --> 02:19:24,814
It seems that we,
Bendini, Lambert & Locke,

1615
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:27,442
the entire firm, has been engaged in a...

1616
02:19:28,902 --> 02:19:31,112
Well, a conspiracy.

1617
02:19:33,115 --> 02:19:36,367
We've been

1618
02:19:36,452 --> 02:19:38,911
overbilling our clients.

1619
02:19:54,845 --> 02:19:57,472
In some cases, massive overbilling.

1620
02:19:58,974 --> 02:20:03,811
I assure you I had no idea any of this
was going on when I joined the Firm.

1621
02:20:03,937 --> 02:20:07,273
Well, I feel I have to report
this criminal behavior.

1622
02:20:08,650 --> 02:20:10,485
But I can't use...

1623
02:20:10,611 --> 02:20:15,615
I can't use your invoices
without your written authorization.

1624
02:20:15,699 --> 02:20:17,992
- Our invoices?
- Tony, please.

1625
02:20:18,952 --> 02:20:20,203
Listen.

1626
02:20:20,329 --> 02:20:21,454
Yes, sir. Your bills.

1627
02:20:21,538 --> 02:20:25,750
You see, it's an important part
of the proof that we've overbilled you.

1628
02:20:27,336 --> 02:20:28,711
That's it?

1629
02:20:30,506 --> 02:20:32,715
Pretty much.

1630
02:20:32,841 --> 02:20:36,886
Well, most of our clients
have already agreed, pretty much all.

1631
02:20:37,012 --> 02:20:39,764
Except for you. Which is why I'm here.

1632
02:20:41,391 --> 02:20:45,019
And this is what
you've been talking to the FBI about?

1633
02:20:46,605 --> 02:20:48,856
You want us to let you turn our bills...

1634
02:20:48,941 --> 02:20:52,902
What we charged you,
I should say overcharged you.

1635
02:20:53,028 --> 02:20:55,863
...over to the government.
- Yes, sir.

1636
02:20:55,948 --> 02:20:57,990
- Now, does that in any way...
- No, sir.

1637
02:20:58,075 --> 02:21:02,703
It does not in any way waive your rights
to full and complete confidentiality

1638
02:21:02,788 --> 02:21:06,374
in any other area
of the attorney-client relationship.

1639
02:21:08,877 --> 02:21:10,753
I'm your lawyer, gentlemen.

1640
02:21:12,214 --> 02:21:15,174
Whether I like it or not, I can't talk
to the government about you

1641
02:21:15,259 --> 02:21:17,885
even when I'm no longer your lawyer.

1642
02:21:19,555 --> 02:21:22,431
That would be breaking my word,
my oath.

1643
02:21:23,058 --> 02:21:24,725
All right, Mitch.

1644
02:21:25,769 --> 02:21:28,271
So what was this stealing of the files?

1645
02:21:28,397 --> 02:21:30,898
What the fuck was this all about?

1646
02:21:30,983 --> 02:21:33,276
The files haven't been stolen.

1647
02:21:33,402 --> 02:21:36,404
They're in exactly the same place
they were.

1648
02:21:37,239 --> 02:21:40,158
I just felt it was important for me
to be thoroughly familiar

1649
02:21:40,242 --> 02:21:42,743
with the precise make-up
and whereabouts

1650
02:21:42,828 --> 02:21:45,580
of all your holdings and activities.

1651
02:21:46,957 --> 02:21:50,293
So I prepared copies of everything.

1652
02:21:53,505 --> 02:21:55,798
That way you and I
can communicate perfectly,

1653
02:21:55,924 --> 02:21:59,677
and, of course,
if we ever have to talk to a third party,

1654
02:22:01,263 --> 02:22:02,972
then I know everything,

1655
02:22:03,098 --> 02:22:07,435
right down to the penny, pound,
franc and deutsche mark.

1656
02:22:08,854 --> 02:22:11,564
I know everything you know.

1657
02:22:11,648 --> 02:22:14,275
As I should, as your attorney.

1658
02:22:16,403 --> 02:22:20,198
And what if the Firm
should desire at some point

1659
02:22:20,282 --> 02:22:22,283
to terminate your employment?

1660
02:22:22,367 --> 02:22:28,789
Whatever I know, wherever I go, I am
bound by the attorney-client privilege.

1661
02:22:29,917 --> 02:22:32,126
I am very much like...

1662
02:22:33,795 --> 02:22:36,214
I would say I am exactly like

1663
02:22:37,591 --> 02:22:41,219
a ship carrying a cargo
that will never reach any port.

1664
02:22:43,305 --> 02:22:48,851
And as long as I am alive, that ship
will always be at sea, so to speak.

1665
02:22:49,895 --> 02:22:52,688
Like Yasir-fucking-Arafat, huh?

1666
02:22:53,232 --> 02:22:55,650
Never a night in the same place.

1667
02:22:57,319 --> 02:23:00,238
In any case,
I need your written authorization,

1668
02:23:00,322 --> 02:23:04,408
so I can release your bills,
like every other client has given.

1669
02:23:09,998 --> 02:23:12,917
You have this authorization with you?

1670
02:23:13,001 --> 02:23:14,293
I do.

1671
02:23:37,401 --> 02:23:39,652
- Anything in there?
- Nothing.

1672
02:23:43,073 --> 02:23:44,115
Fuck!

1673
02:23:44,908 --> 02:23:48,744
You got the account number?
You know how to access it?

1674
02:23:48,829 --> 02:23:50,204
Mitch has verified
that the money's there.

1675
02:23:50,289 --> 02:23:52,081
$750,000.

1676
02:23:52,165 --> 02:23:54,750
I love your crooked little mouth.

1677
02:24:03,427 --> 02:24:05,428
Well, it's not my best feature.

1678
02:24:05,554 --> 02:24:07,138
Wow!

1679
02:24:08,807 --> 02:24:09,932
Well, what is?

1680
02:24:33,248 --> 02:24:35,291
Where the hell are you?

1681
02:24:42,507 --> 02:24:44,800
What is this supposed to be? Huh?

1682
02:24:44,926 --> 02:24:47,094
- You let the Moroltos off the hook?
- They're my clients.

1683
02:24:47,179 --> 02:24:49,263
They're the crooks.
You're letting the Mafia get away.

1684
02:24:49,348 --> 02:24:51,307
- What the hell are you doing?
- You guys are always one villain

1685
02:24:51,433 --> 02:24:52,433
behind the times, you know that?

1686
02:24:52,517 --> 02:24:54,643
You gave me a bunch of pencil pushers
who padded their bills.

1687
02:24:54,770 --> 02:24:57,021
You think if they don't pull guns,
they aren't the bad guys.

1688
02:24:57,105 --> 02:24:59,148
Ask the Moroltos who's harder to find,

1689
02:24:59,274 --> 02:25:01,233
the killer or the lawyer
who hides their money.

1690
02:25:01,318 --> 02:25:02,360
Don't give me that shit!

1691
02:25:02,444 --> 02:25:03,569
That's a bunch of double talk
and you know it.

1692
02:25:03,653 --> 02:25:05,905
You want the Mafia? Get their lawyers.

1693
02:25:05,989 --> 02:25:08,199
Without the Firm, the only way
the Moroltos can launder money

1694
02:25:08,283 --> 02:25:09,408
is in a washing machine.

1695
02:25:09,493 --> 02:25:11,243
You are so naive.

1696
02:25:11,328 --> 02:25:13,162
There'll be a thousand other
Bendini-Lamberts

1697
02:25:13,288 --> 02:25:14,997
fighting for the chance
to launder money tomorrow.

1698
02:25:15,123 --> 02:25:16,832
How the hell you gonna get all of them?

1699
02:25:16,958 --> 02:25:18,459
One at a time.

1700
02:25:19,378 --> 02:25:20,753
I'm a lawyer and I got mine.

1701
02:25:20,837 --> 02:25:23,047
You're the cop, Tarrance,
you get the rest of them.

1702
02:25:23,131 --> 02:25:24,465
Get them with what?

1703
02:25:24,549 --> 02:25:27,134
Overbilling? Mail fraud? That's exciting.

1704
02:25:27,219 --> 02:25:32,264
It's not sexy, but it's got teeth,
$10,000 and five years in prison.

1705
02:25:32,349 --> 02:25:34,892
That's 10 and five for each act.

1706
02:25:36,144 --> 02:25:38,312
Have you really looked at that?

1707
02:25:38,397 --> 02:25:41,273
You've got every partner in the Firm
on overbilling.

1708
02:25:41,358 --> 02:25:43,901
There's 250 acts
of documented mail fraud there.

1709
02:25:43,985 --> 02:25:45,194
That's racketeering.

1710
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:48,322
That's a minimum
of 1,250 years in prison

1711
02:25:48,407 --> 02:25:50,783
and two and a half million dollars
in fines.

1712
02:25:50,867 --> 02:25:52,868
That's more than you had on Capone.

1713
02:25:52,994 --> 02:25:56,372
You twist this into whatever you want.
You made a deal to save your ass.

1714
02:25:56,498 --> 02:25:58,833
You got our money,
three quarters of a million dollars of it,

1715
02:25:58,917 --> 02:26:01,252
you're still a hot-shot lawyer
and you're out of this.

1716
02:26:01,336 --> 02:26:02,545
I didn't keep a nickel of your money.

1717
02:26:02,671 --> 02:26:04,547
It was always for somebody else.

1718
02:26:04,673 --> 02:26:05,714
And, yeah,

1719
02:26:05,841 --> 02:26:08,300
I'm still a lawyer with references
from Bendini, Lambert & Locke.

1720
02:26:08,385 --> 02:26:11,220
You want to put that on your resume?

1721
02:26:11,346 --> 02:26:13,472
You think I'm ever gonna
turn on the ignition in my car again

1722
02:26:13,557 --> 02:26:14,682
without sweating?

1723
02:26:14,766 --> 02:26:18,227
Then I don't understand you.
What did you do it for?

1724
02:26:19,563 --> 02:26:20,938
You didn't win a thing.

1725
02:26:21,022 --> 02:26:25,276
Oh, yeah, I did. I won my life back.
You don't run me and they don't run me.

1726
02:26:26,361 --> 02:26:28,154
You want to know something weird?

1727
02:26:28,238 --> 02:26:31,824
I discovered the law again.
You actually made me think about it.

1728
02:26:31,908 --> 02:26:36,370
I managed to get through three years
of law school without doing that.

1729
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:42,877
It's you at the dog track.
I could've gone public with it.

1730
02:26:42,961 --> 02:26:45,754
- Why didn't you?
- It's against the law.

1731
02:26:51,553 --> 02:26:52,970
Okay.

1732
02:26:55,891 --> 02:26:59,768
How in the hell
did you ever come up with mail fraud?

1733
02:27:01,062 --> 02:27:03,063
It was on the bar exam.

1734
02:27:04,441 --> 02:27:07,067
They made me study like hell for it.

1735
02:27:43,563 --> 02:27:47,650
Well, you've had a busy day.

1736
02:27:50,487 --> 02:27:52,154
So did you.

1737
02:27:54,658 --> 02:27:57,618
Why didn't you tell me the truth
about your plan?

1738
02:27:57,744 --> 02:27:59,787
All of it? The Moroltos.

1739
02:28:00,413 --> 02:28:04,124
Because I knew you'd worry,
and that might make you stay.

1740
02:28:05,460 --> 02:28:07,920
And I knew you needed to leave.

1741
02:28:18,014 --> 02:28:20,766
I like what you've done to the place.

1742
02:28:21,768 --> 02:28:24,979
- I thought you were going to your folks'.
- I was.

1743
02:28:27,357 --> 02:28:29,024
Some detour.

1744
02:28:32,612 --> 02:28:34,154
Where are you going?

1745
02:28:34,281 --> 02:28:35,990
To look for you.

1746
02:28:40,662 --> 02:28:44,957
I guess I didn't feel I could leave you
without trying to help you.

1747
02:28:48,503 --> 02:28:51,297
Do you want to tell me what happened?

1748
02:28:54,509 --> 02:28:56,176
Someday.

1749
02:28:58,179 --> 02:29:02,516
I think you should know
that Avery was pretty decent.

1750
02:29:05,353 --> 02:29:09,440
He was decent, and corrupt,

1751
02:29:09,524 --> 02:29:11,900
and ruined, and so unhappy...

1752
02:29:12,027 --> 02:29:13,068
Listen, Abby...

1753
02:29:13,194 --> 02:29:15,112
And it could have happened to you,
all of it.

1754
02:29:15,196 --> 02:29:16,697
You were on your way.

1755
02:29:16,823 --> 02:29:18,407
Did I lose you?

1756
02:29:25,373 --> 02:29:26,540
You look tired.

1757
02:29:26,666 --> 02:29:27,875
Did I?

1758
02:29:39,846 --> 02:29:42,056
I've loved you all my life.

1759
02:29:44,351 --> 02:29:46,143
Even before we met.

1760
02:29:48,897 --> 02:29:52,691
Part of it wasn't even you,
it was just a promise of you.

1761
02:29:54,027 --> 02:29:58,656
But these last days,
you kept your promise.

1762
02:30:06,331 --> 02:30:08,248
How could you lose me?

1763
02:30:41,199 --> 02:30:44,201
- You think it will make it?
- Make it where?

1764
02:30:45,537 --> 02:30:47,204
Boston.

1765
02:30:47,288 --> 02:30:49,039
What's in Boston?

1766
02:30:49,708 --> 02:30:51,041
We are.

1767
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:57,047
And the Wong Boys, and my kids.

1768
02:30:58,883 --> 02:31:02,469
And a very small unknown law firm.

1769
02:31:02,554 --> 02:31:04,596
With a lot of potential.

1770
02:31:05,807 --> 02:31:07,057
Yeah.
