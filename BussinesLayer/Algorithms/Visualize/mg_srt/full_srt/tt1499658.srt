1
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:37,445
<i>I get to work before the sun comes up</i>
<i>and I leave long after it's gone down.</i>

2
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:42,018
<i>I haven't had sex in six months</i>
<i>with someone other than myself.</i>

3
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:44,917
<i>And the only thing in my refrigerator</i>
<i>is an old lime.</i>

4
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,819
<i>Could be a kiwi. No way to tell.</i>

5
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:50,085
- Morning, Thomas.
-Good morning, Nick. You better hurry.

6
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,786
<i>But here's the thing:</i>

7
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,588
<i>This is just temporary.</i>

8
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:57,024
<i>Quick story:</i>

9
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:59,932
<i>My grandmother came to this country</i>
<i>with $20 in her pocket.</i>

10
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,198
<i>She worked hard her whole life</i>
<i>and never took shit from anyone.</i>

11
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:08,641
<i>When she died, she had</i>
<i>turned that $20 into $2000.</i>

12
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,644
<i>That sucks.</i>

13
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,647
<i>You know why she didn't succeed?</i>

14
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:15,480
<i>Because she didn't take shit</i>
<i>from anyone.</i>

15
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:16,745
<i>The key to success--</i>

16
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,789
<i>They will not teach you this</i>
<i>in business school. --is taking shit.</i>

17
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:24,390
<i>That's what I've been doing the last</i>
<i>eight years, and it's all about to pay off.</i>

18
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,585
This is Nick.

19
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:29,700
<i>I'm this close to getting a big promotion</i>
<i>with my own office.</i>

20
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:31,390
I'll be right there, Mr. Harken.

21
00:01:31,557 --> 00:01:34,868
<i>Then all the endless hours,</i>
<i>and the sacrifice and the shit-eating...</i>

22
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:36,301
<i>...will have been worth it.</i>

23
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:38,271
See, this is what concerns me, Nick.

24
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,207
You're a punctual guy. You know
the importance of being here right at 6 a.m.

25
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:45,177
Which is what leads me to think that...

26
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:48,444
...there must be something wrong
with the clock on our system.

27
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,950
May have been a minute late.

28
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:53,614
But according to this, you were
two minutes late. So either you're a liar...

29
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,490
...or this system is off by a full minute.

30
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,890
<i>The only hitch?</i>

31
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:02,293
<i>I work for this guy, David Harken...</i>

32
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:06,801
<i>...who right now is giving me some</i>
<i>fresh shit for being two minutes late.</i>

33
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,133
<i>He's a total fucking asshole.</i>

34
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:13,538
If that's the case, I'm gonna have to fire
Thomas, our longtime security coordinator.

35
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,975
- I may have been two minutes late.
- Oh.

36
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,781
Well, then you were lying.

37
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,040
No. I-- Who you calling?

38
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:21,852
- Thomas. I gotta let him go.
- No, uh--

39
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,316
- I was lying. Sorry.
- Lying?

40
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:27,424
I didn't mean to. It was more of a saying.
"Might have been a minute late."

41
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:32,153
Literally, uh, truthfully,
was two minutes late.

42
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:37,031
Boy, I have to get used to driving
with this big, heavy ring on my finger.

43
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:39,567
- Come on.
- I keep swerving to the left, babe.

44
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:43,104
<i>When I was a kid, people would</i>
<i>ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up.</i>

45
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,832
<i>I always gave the same answer.</i>

46
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,067
I love you so much.

47
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,734
I love you too.

48
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,243
<i>I wanted to be a husband.</i>

49
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:51,677
- I will call you when I'm done.
- Have a good day.

50
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:53,111
<i>I know that sounds weird.</i>

51
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:56,481
<i>Most boys wanna be firehouse chiefs</i>
<i>or personal trainers...</i>

52
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,920
<i>...but to me being a husband</i>
<i>was, like, the highest calling.</i>

53
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,217
<i>And thanks to Stacy...</i>

54
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,254
<i>...that dream's about to come true.</i>

55
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:07,921
<i>Unfortunately, no one's gonna pay you</i>
<i>to be a husband unless you marry Oprah.</i>

56
00:03:08,086 --> 00:03:09,896
<i>So I had to find a job.</i>

57
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,263
<i>Now, I always admired dentists.</i>

58
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,406
<i>They're smart, they're capable,</i>
<i>they keep your teeth healthy.</i>

59
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,168
<i>So I went out and I became one.</i>

60
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,510
- How are you today, Dale?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

61
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:22,868
Excavator.

62
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,539
<i>Okay, I became a dental assistant.</i>
<i>It's basically the same thing.</i>

63
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,913
<i>I just make a lot less money.</i>

64
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:31,146
Did you ever see that show <i>Gossip Girl</i>?

65
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,187
- No.
- Ooh.

66
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,292
I watched an episode last night.

67
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:39,596
I fingered myself so hard to that
Penn Badgley guy, I broke a nail.

68
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,824
<i>And it would have been</i>
<i>the perfect job. If not for one...</i>

69
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,403
<i>...evil crazy bitch, D.D.S.</i>

70
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,707
I bet you're no shrimp in
the cock department, huh, there, Dale?

71
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:52,170
- Okay, Julia. Come on.
- What?

72
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:55,336
- I'm uncomfortable talking about that.
- Oh, Dale, come on.

73
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,945
You know that I like to fool around.

74
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,604
- Oops.
-Mr. Anderton.

75
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,350
Not in the office. This is bad.

76
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,317
- Bad, bad, bad!
- You probably shouldn't hit the patients.

77
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:07,687
Ah, I love this. So festive.

78
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,019
<i>I love my job.</i>

79
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:12,993
<i>If you ask me, anyone who hates their job</i>
<i>has no one to blame but themself.</i>

80
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:15,632
<i>We make our own destinies,</i>
<i>and I've made a sweet one.</i>

81
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,199
We have stairs.
You don't need to bring your own.

82
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,237
<i>I'm an account manager at a chemical</i>
<i>company. I'll tell you, the job has its perks.</i>

83
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:23,430
Hi, can I help you?

84
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,939
He's just signing for these packages.
Thank you.

85
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,271
Oh, no. I should do this.

86
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:28,911
Reggie, I got this. Thank you, buddy.

87
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,548
- This is high-priority stuff here.
- Thank you.

88
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,307
- So, what's going on here?
- I'm sorry?

89
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,952
- Is this one of those hidden camera shows?
- What do you mean?

90
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:38,281
You're way too cute
to be just a FedEx girl.

91
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,014
You gotta be a model or actress
or something, right?

92
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,389
What happens when I open these?
Something'll jump out, bite my penis?

93
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,656
No. Nothing's gonna jump out.
I'm just a FedEx girl.

94
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,264
- Shut up.
- Ha, ha.

95
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,764
- Bye.
- Have a great afternoon.

96
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:51,957
Thank you.

97
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,935
<i>I didn't sign that form, by the way,</i>
<i>so she has to come back.</i>

98
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:56,129
She's cute, huh, Reg?

99
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:59,209
- Caught another fly in your web, did you?
- Ha, ha. Hey, Jack.

100
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:02,072
<i>But the real reason I'm here is this guy:</i>

101
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,579
<i>Jack Pellit, my boss.</i>
<i>The sweetest man I know.</i>

102
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,778
<i>He loves me and I love him.</i>
<i>Everybody loves him.</i>

103
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,478
- You all right, Margie?
- Hi, Mr. Pellit. Kurt.

104
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,749
I've been waiting to get in there
for a while.

105
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,324
- Who's in there?
- It's your son.

106
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,050
Bobby!

107
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:22,255
Margie's waiting.
You nearly done in there?

108
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,004
A man can't get any privacy around here.

109
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,764
- Okay, Margie. Bobby?
- What?

110
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,175
Your stomach okay? You seem
to spend more time on the toilet...

111
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:33,504
...than at your desk.

112
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:37,204
I didn't realize I had to tell you
every time I wanna take a dump.

113
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,509
<i>If the worst thing about this job</i>
<i>is having to tolerate my boss's...</i>

114
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,382
<i>...dipshit cokehead son,</i>
<i>well, it's a small price to pay.</i>

115
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:46,182
Need me to tell you when I pee-pee?

116
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,691
I'm just trying to get you to do
your part, son. It's not easy times.

117
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:52,192
I do my part. I do other people's parts.

118
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:56,300
But it doesn't matter to you. You just
wanna ride my ass because I'm your son.

119
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:00,267
You know what? I don't hear you
giving dickskin any shit.

120
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:02,372
- "Dickskin"? Nice.
- Kiss-ass.

121
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,529
-Come on, come on.
- Yeah, go on. In you go.

122
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,175
Get in the fucking--!

123
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,608
- I'm a green belt, motherfucker.
- What?

124
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,805
- Yeah. All right?
-Okay.

125
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,213
Now, I know you've been working
your tail off for that promotion.

126
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,478
But I'm not sure I can even consider...

127
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:20,714
...making you the senior vice president
of sales...

128
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:24,160
...if I can't trust you.

129
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,393
- You can trust me.
- Yeah, now you sound like my wife.

130
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:30,226
"Trust me. You can trust me, honey.

131
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,630
Nothing's happening behind your back.
Trust me."

132
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,773
Meanwhile, she's fucking
every guy in the neighborhood.

133
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:39,336
Oh, you want one?

134
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,074
It's 8:15 a.m.

135
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:44,771
Well, is there something wrong with
a man enjoying a drink in the morning?

136
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,550
No.

137
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,749
Thank you. Sure, thanks.

138
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,521
Bottoms up.

139
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,593
Nothing for you?

140
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:05,060
Nick, it's 8:15 in the morning.
I'm not an alcoholic.

141
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,928
The only reason I took one,
I thought you were gonna have one.

142
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,100
You took one because you thought I was?
Is that something a senior VP would do?

143
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,177
I was just trying to be polite.

144
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,007
So if I, uh, was gonna put my balls
in honey and shaved coconut...

145
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,206
...you'd do that too?

146
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,680
- I would not.
- Sure?

147
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,218
- Yeah.
- Because I've got some coconut.

148
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,949
I'm having my teeth whitened Tuesday. You
have to get your work done by Monday...

149
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:30,492
...which means you'll probably
be here all weekend.

150
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,062
Look, if you want a promotion,
you gotta earn it.

151
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,526
Now, what do I keep saying?

152
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,167
Life is a marathon,
and you cannot win a marathon...

153
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:40,600
...without putting a few Band-Aids
on your nipples, right?

154
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,329
Right.

155
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:44,566
Nick.

156
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,800
It's 18-year-old Scotch.

157
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,470
You don't really expect me to
pour it back into the bottle, do you?

158
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,555
- Water.
- Yep.

159
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,233
All right. Let's see if this thing's working.
Oh!

160
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:17,401
- Oh, my God.
-Oh! I'm sorry. I'm a squirter, Dale.

161
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:21,305
- Oh, you know what?
- What?

162
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:25,677
Ah. I think I can make out
our little friend right there.

163
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,872
Stop it.

164
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,617
- Somebody's circumcised.
- Okay.

165
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:32,614
- Listen.
- What?

166
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:36,725
- Can we stop doing this thing here?
- Why? Because you have a girlfriend?

167
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,688
She's not just my girlfriend anymore.
We're engaged now.

168
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:42,696
- What?
- We're engaged.

169
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,966
You said that she was
just a hole for your dick.

170
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,072
I never said that.

171
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:50,467
Not really my style.

172
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,000
Shut up.

173
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,876
That's a lot of gas.

174
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:59,140
- That's good. No, those are great ideas.
- Yeah?

175
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:01,375
- Put them down on paper, will you?
- Will do.

176
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,190
- You're happy here, aren't you?
- Yeah, of course.

177
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:09,090
Good.

178
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,020
You got a bright future here,
you know?

179
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:15,126
Someday soon,
it'll be you running this place.

180
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,192
- See you, kid.
- All right, now.

181
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:21,201
- Drive safe.
- Yeah.

182
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:26,969
Oh, shit.

183
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,338
<i>He had a heart attack.</i>

184
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:33,283
They said his, uh, heart burst in his chest
like a water balloon.

185
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,277
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, man.
I know you guys were close.

186
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:39,923
Yeah. Yeah, I loved that guy.

187
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:43,288
I loved working for him, you know?
It was, like, awesome.

188
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:46,088
Now his shitbag son's
gonna be in charge and it's like--

189
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:47,287
The cokehead?

190
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:50,126
Yeah. Know how many times
I caught him doing blow at work?

191
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:54,465
This thing's a real bummer. Sorry. You're
the only one of us who didn't hate his job.

192
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:58,972
Did I tell you that Harken tricked me
into having a drink at 8:00 this morning?

193
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,769
I mean, I work for the Antichrist.

194
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:03,879
- How did he trick you?
- I thought he was giving you a promotion.

195
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:06,447
He is, definitely.
That's why he's being extra evil.

196
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,950
This is his last chance
to make my life miserable.

197
00:10:09,107 --> 00:10:12,214
Right. At least your boss
isn't sexually harassing you.

198
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,187
- God. Here we go.
- Don't give me shit.

199
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:15,951
You won't get sympathy for this.

200
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,619
She's going crazy. It's like a totally
hostile work environment now, man.

201
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,230
- It's not funny.
- Yeah?

202
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:25,494
All right, today she starts spraying water
at my crotch to see the outline of my dick.

203
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,068
- That's great.
- It's not great.

204
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:30,230
What are you talking about?
Why don't you just, you know, fuck her?

205
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:34,037
Because I am engaged to be married
and I love my fiancée, okay?

206
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,235
That's true.

207
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,812
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

208
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,448
What about getting
a different dental hygienist job?

209
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:40,709
I can't get another job.

210
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,786
- No, he's a child molester, Nick.
- No, uh, deviant. Sexual deviant?

211
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:46,355
What is it? How do they classify it?
Sex offender.

212
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:48,321
I'm on the registered
sex offender list, yes.

213
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:53,220
You can't get that expunged? All you did
was pull your dick out on a playground.

214
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:55,662
I was taking a piss at night,
there were no kids.

215
00:10:55,821 --> 00:11:00,133
All right, you know what? You don't
put a playground right next to a bar.

216
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,827
-It's entrapment.
- Mm-hm.

217
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:06,866
Speaking of entrapment, I'm gonna go
see that girl about her vagina.

218
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,644
Excuse me.

219
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,811
He did say 10:00, right?

220
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:18,950
- Yeah. Do you know what this is about?
- It just said "staff meeting" on the memo.

221
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,616
It's funny how he gets all over my ass if I'm
a minute late, but then he makes us wait 15.

222
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,490
-You were two minutes late.
- Morning.

223
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,961
Didn't think I had to punch a clock
with you.

224
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,395
I'll just attribute this
to your drinking problem.

225
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,230
- I don't have--
- Please, we're in the middle of a meeting.

226
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,566
Morning, everyone.
So I have finally decided...

227
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:42,904
...who I want to be our new
senior vice president of sales.

228
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,313
He's right here in this room.

229
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,615
- It's me.
- What'd he say?

230
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:54,052
I've decided to absorb
the responsibilities...

231
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:56,886
...of the senior VP position
into my own.

232
00:11:57,048 --> 00:12:00,655
I've realized if you wanna get something
done right, you gotta do it yourself.

233
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,995
I'll break through the wall of the office
that would have been the senior VP's...

234
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,296
...and make one huge, enormous office.

235
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,739
However, I will only be taking 85 percent
of the additional salary I am entitled to...

236
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,811
...and that is self-sacrifice, people.
Learn from it.

237
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:17,413
Fucker!

238
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,414
You fucking son of a bitch!

239
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:25,154
You are so fucking fired!

240
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,525
Yeah!

241
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,692
So, meeting adjourned.

242
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:40,198
- Can I speak to you?
- Sure, what is it?

243
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,306
For months you've been hinting
I was in line for that promotion.

244
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:45,442
And look how hard you've been working.

245
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:47,509
- You were just lying to me?
- Lying?

246
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,171
No, Nick, motivating.

247
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:54,010
I mean, look, we're all
part of the same team here.

248
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,415
Plus, you know, I'm the one
who's gonna be doing all the extra work.

249
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,749
You know last month
you made me work so late...

250
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,586
...I missed saying goodbye
to my Gam Gam?

251
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:05,994
- Sorry, what?
- My grandmother.

252
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,792
I told you I needed to see her
because she was very sick.

253
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:10,831
You said if I left early, I'd get fired.

254
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,095
And she died
before I made it to the hospital.

255
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,067
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

256
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:21,673
I had no idea that you called
your grandmother "Gam Gam."

257
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,647
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

258
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,986
I'm sorry you didn't get to
say bye-bye to Gam Gam.

259
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,554
Really, I really am. I'm sorry.

260
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:38,388
But I needed you to work late because you
are an invaluable member of this operation.

261
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,587
And I need you in the position you're in.

262
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,700
Well, tough shit, okay?

263
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:49,062
Been in that position for eight years. Why
would I stay after being treated like this?

264
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:53,267
Well, because I'd make sure that nobody
in the industry would ever hire you again.

265
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,570
Bullshit.

266
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:58,111
No, because they're gonna want
my letter of recommendation, right?

267
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:03,879
So I'm perfectly willing to write that
you are an insubordinate, dishonest drunk.

268
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,250
You can't do that. That's not true.

269
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:13,789
Let me tell you something,
you stupid little runt.

270
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,557
I own you.

271
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,166
You're my bitch.

272
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:20,360
Don't walk around thinking
you have free will because you don't.

273
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,903
I can crush you any time I want.

274
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:28,235
So settle in because you are here
for the long haul.

275
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,928
Yo, dickwall.

276
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:48,990
- What the fuck?
- What?

277
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:52,429
Three hours late. What's the deal?

278
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,999
- I was at your father's funeral.
- Uh-huh. Mm-hm.

279
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,130
Maybe that excuse would have flown when
my dad was here, but I'm in charge now.

280
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,073
That excuse wouldn't make any sense
if your dad was still here.

281
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,803
Whoa.

282
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,971
In my office, now.

283
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:10,743
Yes?

284
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,145
All right, sit.

285
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,813
- I'm not a dog, Bobby.
- Good boy.

286
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,222
I've been looking through the books.
You're the accountant. Tell me...

287
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,125
- ...why is this company in the crapper?
- Well, we're not.

288
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,062
- It's a recession, but we're still profitable.
- Bullshit.

289
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:25,668
Look...

290
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,865
...I know you and my dad were, uh, pals.
Okay?

291
00:15:30,028 --> 00:15:32,908
Frankly, I always thought
it was a little bit weird and gay.

292
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,408
I have no idea why he thought
you were so fucking special.

293
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,841
But that doesn't matter now,
he's in the ground.

294
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,846
I'm your boss. And there's gonna be
some changes around here.

295
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:43,110
- Can't wait to hear them.
- First things first.

296
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:46,051
EnviroTech Waste Management.
It's costing us a lot of money.

297
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,657
Your dad chose to dispose
of our waste responsibly.

298
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:50,486
To do that, you gotta spend money.

299
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,493
Bolivians will do it for a third
of the price. I'll hire them.

300
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:54,926
- You can't go to them.
- Why?

301
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:57,067
They're gonna endanger
local residents.

302
00:15:57,221 --> 00:16:00,499
Oh, I give a fuck some tribesman
gets cancer. Cry me a fucking river.

303
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:02,501
They're not tribesmen.
It's a modern society.

304
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,072
Do I look like I fucking care?

305
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,708
Your dad told me very clearly
he would rather die...

306
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,741
...than save money
and hurt people, okay?

307
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,438
Well, guess what, looks like
we're right on schedule, doesn't it?

308
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,815
What else? Gotta trim
some of the fat around here.

309
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,080
What do you mean by "trim the fat"?

310
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,484
- I want you to fire the fat people.
- What?

311
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:23,182
They're lazy, and slow
and they make me sad to look at.

312
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,523
You can start with Large Marge.
Marge, can you come in here, please?

313
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:29,688
No, Margie's not fat, she's pregnant.
I'm not gonna fire her.

314
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,265
Well, fine. Uh...

315
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,926
<i>...stay where you are, Marge.</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>

316
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,568
- You can fire, uh, Professor Xavier.
- Who are you talking about?

317
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:41,277
- You mean Hank?
- Yeah.

318
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:44,676
He creeps me out, rolling around
all day in his special secret chair.

319
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,874
- He's up to something.
- I won't fire anyone.

320
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:49,076
- You're not? Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

321
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,687
It's like you don't care
about this company at all.

322
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,381
No fucking shit I don't care about
this company. This is just an ATM to me.

323
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:59,017
You think when I was a kid I dreamed
of running a fucking chemical company?

324
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:03,256
No. I dreamed of being on a beach
with a model serving me tropical drinks.

325
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,959
That's what I dreamed of.
That's what's gonna happen...

326
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:10,835
...as soon as I squeeze the profit out
of this company. But first things first.

327
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,071
You either fire the fatty or you
fire the cripple, or I fire all three of you.

328
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,547
Do the math.

329
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:20,115
One loses the job or three loses it.

330
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:24,078
And tell him to leave his handicap
parking pass here as well.

331
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:28,013
Come in.

332
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:30,518
Julia, you needed to see me?

333
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:31,887
Oh, shit.

334
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:39,659
Uh-oh.

335
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,528
- Will you have a seat, Dale?
- Do I have to?

336
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:44,530
Please.

337
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:47,875
Sure.

338
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:54,249
This is a little ridiculous, but--

339
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,013
Look, Dale, you know, I know that
I like to fool around at work. Right?

340
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:02,454
And I might even-- You know,
I might even cross the line a bit.

341
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:06,255
But the last thing that I wanna do
is make you uncomfortable.

342
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:09,394
I mean, it's just not professional.
You know?

343
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,933
And I pride myself
on being a professional.

344
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,700
So from now on, what I would like you
to do is just tell me, you know...

345
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,208
...when and if, uh, I cross the line. Okay?

346
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:23,811
Okay. Now.

347
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,338
What?

348
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:29,008
Well, now,
you're kind of crossing a line...

349
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:31,252
...because you're naked.

350
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,945
Uh....

351
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,521
Not naked, Dale.

352
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,855
- Can you see my pussy?
- Hmm.

353
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,490
True. Um....

354
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:47,398
But I think, uh, even really
saying the word "pussy" is--

355
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:49,560
- That's crossing the line?
- Little bit.

356
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,833
You're starting to sound like
a little faggot.

357
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,705
There we go. That one's another one,
probably illegal thing to say too.

358
00:18:55,867 --> 00:19:00,942
Okay. Let's not talk about illegal,
Mr. I-Like-To-Pee-On-Little-Boys.

359
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:03,643
It was an empty playground
in the middle of the night.

360
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:06,221
Ah. That's weirder. Poor child
must have been terrified.

361
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:09,621
There were no children. No kids in the park.
Why do people think that?

362
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,990
You know what? Forget it. Listen,
let's just cut to the chase, all right, mister?

363
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,098
- You're engaged now.
- Right.

364
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:20,828
And I respect the institution of
marriage way too much to violate it.

365
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:25,039
So that's why you're gonna have to
fuck me well before the wedding.

366
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:29,942
Because the closer we get to this date,
the less ladylike I'm gonna feel about it.

367
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,444
Julia, I'm not gonna sleep with you.

368
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,015
We'll see about that.

369
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,858
Get out.

370
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:47,563
Could you do the, uh...?

371
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,802
I'm a sucker.
Harken wasn't gonna promote me.

372
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,666
That coked-up prick
is gonna ruin Pellit Chemicals.

373
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,703
He's just gonna fire everybody.

374
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,845
She stood there with her breasts
right in my face.

375
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,138
Yeah, you know,
yours doesn't sound that bad.

376
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,873
I'll stop bringing it up.

377
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,108
I don't understand
why you guys don't quit.

378
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:11,720
Julia's the only one who'd hire me.
Are you registered sex offenders?

379
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:15,790
Going to school, changing fields, starting
from the bottom. Who wants to do that?

380
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,919
What do I care about protecting
Pellit's name when his own son doesn't?

381
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,156
- Gotta be a million jobs out there.
- You could find another job.

382
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:25,768
-Is this really happening? Look at this.
- Oh!

383
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:29,371
The Three Musketeers. Nick, Kurt and Dale.
Look, hanging like high school.

384
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,134
-Oh, shit. Kenny's here.
- What's up?

385
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,432
- Yeah, I love this.
- Kenny Sommerfeld.

386
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,739
-In the flesh, boys.
- Oh, my goodness.

387
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,405
Now, I heard you moved to New York,
you're working at Lehman Brothers.

388
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,279
- They, uh, hired me right out of Yale.
- What are you doing here?

389
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,752
-You read the papers? They shut us down.
- Right. Sorry about that.

390
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,221
I've been looking for work
for the last two years.

391
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,417
I can't even get a job waiting tables.

392
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,925
Ah, you know what, though?

393
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,462
I would fucking murder those
Lehman Brothers if I could.

394
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,655
Yeah, I hear you.

395
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,732
Ha. I can't even pay
for this fucking drink.

396
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,267
Well, we'll cover it, right?

397
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:03,269
Seriously, uh, you guys think
you could help me out a little?

398
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,602
- Beyond the drink?
- Maybe some extra scratch, if you got it.

399
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,041
Of course. Kenny, I had no idea
it was that bad, buddy. All I got's 15.

400
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:12,546
-Do you have change for a 10?
- No, I don't.

401
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:16,048
You know what? That's probably
not gonna cut it, so I'll tell you what.

402
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,085
How about I give you guys
some hand jobs?

403
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:19,846
-Do what?
- Forty bucks apiece.

404
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:21,787
We could do it here in the bathroom.

405
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:24,153
- No thanks.
- That's a joke? You're joking?

406
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,385
-Kenny.
- Hey!

407
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:27,028
- Oh, shit.
-Come on, man.

408
00:21:27,184 --> 00:21:28,857
I told you no more handies in here.

409
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,661
You guys change your minds,
I'm staying at my mom's house.

410
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:32,857
Okay.

411
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,133
Maybe don't quit your job.

412
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:41,507
I guess we'll be miserable
for the rest of our lives? That's the deal?

413
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,146
- That's the way it's looking.
-Why you saying that?

414
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,941
We don't have many options, do we?

415
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,047
Think about it, we can quit our jobs
and turn into Kenny...

416
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,483
...or, uh, keep our jobs
and just become spineless losers...

417
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,853
...that spend their entire day
dreaming of ways to kill their bosses.

418
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:57,617
- You do that too?
- Of course.

419
00:21:57,782 --> 00:22:00,923
- Sounds a little sick.
- It's not. It's just a way to blow off steam.

420
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,430
It's not like we're gonna
actually kill our bosses.

421
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:06,067
- Good.
- Ha, ha. Though you would have to admit...

422
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:09,296
...that our lives would be a lot easier
if our bosses weren't alive.

423
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,496
Mm-hm.

424
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:15,269
Hypothetically, if we could do it and none
of us get caught, would you guys do it?

425
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,246
- No.
- I would.

426
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,778
- No, you wouldn't.
- I would.

427
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:20,211
-You would?
- Yeah.

428
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,682
It's not murder if it's justified.
Justifiable homicide, right?

429
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,184
I can't wait to hear this.

430
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,051
If one evil person dies
for the greater good, so be it.

431
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:32,388
You know, Bobby Pellit is an absolute
monster. He's a fucking jerk.

432
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,896
If he has his way, he's gonna end up
killing thousands of innocent Bolivians.

433
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,089
What?

434
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,566
Technically, I think it's immoral
not to kill him.

435
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,638
I should kill Harken for not letting me
say goodbye to Gam Gam?

436
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,775
Yes. Yes, you should.

437
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,775
But I don't care how bad our bosses are.
We're not murderers.

438
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:51,436
Julia is ruining your life, you know?
That's wrong.

439
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,310
- That is wrong.
- It's affecting your possible marriage.

440
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:57,852
- Come on, she's not ruining it.
- Would your life be easier without Julia?

441
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,750
You're right.
Uh, know what I'm gonna do?

442
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,550
I'm gonna go to Julia's house,
maybe I'll slash her up...

443
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:06,320
...and I'll put her in a box and I'll mail it
to you two, uh, tough-guy mafiosos.

444
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:10,297
I'm done with this conversation. You're
paying for dinner because you've upset me.

445
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:13,993
You're paying
and I'm finding a cab somehow.

446
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,765
I was just speaking hypothetically,
you know.

447
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,669
Me too.

448
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,807
Guess who.

449
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,575
Look, I'm really kind of
not in the mood for this.

450
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:28,307
Not in the mood for what?

451
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,743
- Hi.
- Hi, babe.

452
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:31,478
Oh, what are you doing here?

453
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,681
- I invited her.
-Yes. She called.

454
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:39,260
And she said that now that we're engaged,
she wanted to offer me free dental work.

455
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,398
-And you know I have that loose filling.
- Yeah.

456
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,556
This really was so, so sweet of you, Julia.

457
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:47,169
Oh, please. Come on, Stacy,
it's my pleasure.

458
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,826
You're part of the family now.

459
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,145
But, um, I don't know
if it's a good idea, sweetie.

460
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,045
Oh, why not?

461
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:05,586
Because we're mixing pleasure
with business. Business and pleasure.

462
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:07,347
We're taking advantage of Julia.

463
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,420
Dale.

464
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:13,461
There's nothing that you could do ever
that would be taking advantage of me.

465
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:16,430
- Okay?
- So sweet.

466
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,068
All right, you. Let's go say
we pump you full of gas, huh?

467
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,471
- Okay.
-Okay.

468
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,843
Fuck me.

469
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,941
Ten.

470
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,778
Nine.

471
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,143
I don't know
what you're doing with your hand.

472
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,751
-Okay.
- Seven.

473
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:40,445
Put your hand in a safe place
because there's sharp tools here.

474
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,049
Oh, there she goes.

475
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,224
- Come here!
-What are you doing? What are you doing?

476
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,124
You're gonna give me that dong, Dale.

477
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,491
My dong?

478
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:53,602
You're gonna fuck my slutty little mouth.

479
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,967
Do you hear the words you say sometimes?
I mean, who talks like that?

480
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:59,699
Let's have sex on top of her.
Let's use her like a bed.

481
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:03,009
Get down, get down. Hey, hey!
Get off of her.

482
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:07,377
Goddamn you! That's it, okay?
You know what? That's crossing the line.

483
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,040
So I'm done, Julia.

484
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,814
Fuck this. I'm out. I don't need this job.
So goodbye, I'm quitting. I'm done.

485
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,615
I'm gonna tell her you fucked me.

486
00:25:15,346 --> 00:25:16,382
What?

487
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,324
If you don't fuck me,
I'm gonna tell her that you fucked me.

488
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,996
Okay. Tell her whatever the hell you want.
She's not gonna believe you.

489
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:26,298
She already knows
that you're a sex offender.

490
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,704
And I think once she gets a look
at these...

491
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:32,474
...she's gonna believe me.

492
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,938
- What is that?
- Do you remember your first week here?

493
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,376
When I changed the crown
on your second bicuspid?

494
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,674
Yeah.

495
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,349
Well, I just, uh, took a few pictures
of the procedure.

496
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,420
- Oh, my God.
-Right?

497
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,980
Oh, no. What?

498
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,452
Oh. Ooh.

499
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:54,392
You did all this
while I was unconscious?

500
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,463
Ooh. Mm-hm. Yep.

501
00:25:58,355 --> 00:26:00,131
That's my favorite.

502
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,326
- Rape.
- What?

503
00:26:01,492 --> 00:26:03,700
Rape. That's a rape.
This is what raping is.

504
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,432
You're a raper and you've raped me.
That's a rape! Rape!

505
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:09,044
Just relax there, Jodie Foster.

506
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,979
Your dick wasn't even hard.

507
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:12,876
That does not give me any relief.

508
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,746
But it will be next time, and if it is not...

509
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:20,446
...this little sweetheart right here is gonna
get a peek at my little photo album.

510
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:26,586
So please prep the patient
for the bitewing x-ray.

511
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:29,096
I'll be back in a jiffy.

512
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:43,167
I'm in. Let's kill this bitch!

513
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,676
- What bitch?
-"What bitch"? Guys, my boss.

514
00:26:46,837 --> 00:26:50,115
Our bosses need to die. You were right,
man. We should do this thing.

515
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,313
We were drinking last night.
You said that killing is wrong.

516
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:57,721
I know. That was before Julia tried to fuck
me on top of Stacy's unconscious body.

517
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,019
- Really?
-Yes, dude.

518
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:02,563
She's gone fucking batshit crazy.
She took a bunch of photographs of me--

519
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,394
- Where are they?
- They'll ruin my life. I can't show them.

520
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,435
- It's a whole thing. You guys in or out?
- I was in last night.

521
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,630
- Nick, what do you say?
- Please. Let's go.

522
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,829
Nick, come on.

523
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:15,240
Seriously. I mean, uh, what about
your grandma, you know? <i>Bubbe.</i>

524
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,708
-Gam Gam.
- Whatever it is.

525
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:18,972
She didn't get to say goodbye
to her grandson.

526
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:21,980
Because his dickbag of a boss
wouldn't let him leave. Right?

527
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,416
- What would Gam Gam want you to do?
- She wouldn't want me to kill him.

528
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:28,490
Okay, forget about Gam Gam.
She's dead. You gotta accept that.

529
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:31,490
This is about you, Nick.
Okay, what do you want?

530
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,554
Well, obviously I want him gone.

531
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,560
- Exactly. So let's do this.
- Right?

532
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,931
- How do we do this?
-I thought about that.

533
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:40,068
Stacy and I,
we watch a ton of <i>Law & Order</i>.

534
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:43,297
There's all sorts of ways the bad
guys on the show mess up, right?

535
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,567
They leave behind skin cells
and, uh, bullet casing--

536
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:47,766
Sperm.

537
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,037
- Most of the time, it's sperm.
- Silent killer.

538
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,077
Anyway, that's not the point.
Point is...

539
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,717
...we're not qualified.
We gotta hire a professional.

540
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,750
- Are you talking about a hit man?
- Yeah.

541
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:58,615
That's a really good idea.

542
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,586
Yeah. We don't clean
our own apartments or cut our own hair.

543
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,349
- No, we pay someone to do that.
- Yeah.

544
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,425
Uh, where are you two
gonna find a hit man?

545
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,721
Why don't you guys
leave that up to me, okay?

546
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:10,162
I got this whole thing figured out.

547
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,826
I'm gonna give you a call tomorrow,
I'm gonna tell you where to meet me.

548
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:16,563
Why don't you just tell us now?

549
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,867
- Because I don't have it figured out.
- Ah.

550
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,470
But I will.

551
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,133
- Were you followed?
- Why would I be followed?

552
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:47,429
People follow people in these types
of situations. Sure you weren't?

553
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:48,626
Oh, boy. What people?

554
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:50,932
Just take one quick look around,
make sure.

555
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,508
- Let's put this down.
- Look around, make sure some--

556
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:55,405
-Calm down!
- That's what you get.

557
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,843
Shut the door, take the chain off
and let me in.

558
00:28:58,001 --> 00:28:59,913
- I pissed him off already.
- Already?

559
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,053
What the hell's going on, huh?
What are we doing here?

560
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:08,281
- I don't want an assassin in my apartment.
- Don't want this guy knowing where we live.

561
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:11,983
Hang on, you guys already went ahead
and found someone that's coming here?

562
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,425
- Oh, bigtime.
- Not "we." Dale, all by himself.

563
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:18,259
- It was easy. Easy as buying a used futon.
- You found a hit man online?

564
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,868
Yeah. They don't write "hit man,"
right? That's dumb.

565
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,471
They use code words, like wet work,
right? Liquidation. Check him out.

566
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:26,904
"Skilled professional
with years of experience...

567
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,067
...in domestic and international
wet work.

568
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:31,338
Discreet. No children,
no political figures."

569
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:34,450
That last part was important. I saw that,
I thought, "This is a good idea."

570
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,875
I feel we should've got
a cheese plate for this guy.

571
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,281
- 20/20 hindsight.
- Is that him?

572
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:42,152
- Oh, shit.
-Yeah, that was definitely a car.

573
00:29:46,683 --> 00:29:49,163
- He looks like James Bond.
-He really does, dude.

574
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,290
Bet he carries a gun you screw together.
Those are, like, the coolest guns they make.

575
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,699
So dangerous.
What if that is an undercover cop?

576
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:57,395
- Come on.
- What if it's the real thing?

577
00:29:57,561 --> 00:30:00,542
He charges so much we can't
afford it, gets pissed, kills us.

578
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,608
- Kills all three of us? Hold on.
- That's a thing?

579
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:03,801
Could that happen?

580
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,478
- Gotta let him in.
- How's my hair?

581
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:09,710
- What do you mean?
- It doesn't matter. Let's do this. Okay.

582
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,410
Ready?

583
00:30:18,482 --> 00:30:19,654
Yeah?

584
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:20,986
Are you Dale?

585
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,900
- I am the one they call Dale.
- Hmm.

586
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,134
Please come in.

587
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:30,137
Thank you.

588
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,006
Are all three of you participating in this?

589
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,270
- Yes.
- Well, um....

590
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:39,311
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. Yep.
- Yes.

591
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,107
Very well.

592
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:43,980
Now, before we go any further...

593
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,612
...I need to know if there are
any hidden recording devices in the room.

594
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:49,724
I will find out if there are.

595
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:53,488
I'm sure you would, but there's none
because that would be stupid of us.

596
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,721
- That's a silly move.
- It's a no.

597
00:30:57,588 --> 00:30:59,500
Then let's get started.

598
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,836
- I love this guy.
- This is the real deal.

599
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:05,997
- His voice, you kidding?
- This guy is legit.

600
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:09,441
And you do know that
we just wanna start with a--?

601
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:12,779
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, wait, what's this for?

602
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:14,382
- For the mess.
- What?

603
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:16,143
Wouldn't wanna leave a stain, now.

604
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,308
- Oh, my God. I knew it.
- Who's first?

605
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,819
- "Who's first"? No.
- We don't want you to kill us.

606
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:24,118
We want you to kill another person.
If anyone's first, probably him.

607
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:25,317
No. Goddamn it.

608
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:27,962
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
what are you talking about?

609
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:30,898
Your ad said you do wet work.

610
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,194
That's correct.
I urinate on other men for money.

611
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:35,903
- What was that?
- What'd he say?

612
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,698
I think he said he pisses on dudes.

613
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,502
Why else do you think my ad was
in the "men seeking men" section?

614
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:43,969
Where was it?

615
00:31:44,134 --> 00:31:46,011
- You fucking idiot.
- Could you be dumber?

616
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,378
- Why look in the "men seeking men"--?
- We are men looking for a man!

617
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:51,486
How do people
let you work on their teeth?

618
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,123
They don't, actually.
I just hand the tools to Julia.

619
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:58,590
Are you telling me that I've driven all this
way and nobody wants to get pissed on?

620
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,251
- Uh-uh.
-Well, it's not our thing.

621
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:01,452
Sorry about that.

622
00:32:01,618 --> 00:32:04,963
Can I use your toilet? I stored up
rather a large amount of pee for this.

623
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,898
Sure. Yeah, it's right through there.
Knock yourself out.

624
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:10,903
Oh, and by the way,
I still will want my $200.

625
00:32:11,061 --> 00:32:12,369
-Understandable.
- We insist.

626
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,806
- Two hundred, huh? A bargain.
- To kill three people?

627
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:17,037
- I thought it was such a good deal.
- Dipshit.

628
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,773
- Reflects poorly on me that you're my friend.
- Hear what's going on in there?

629
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,349
That was almost all over us.

630
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,851
Okay, I'm gonna
take the blame on that one.

631
00:32:29,012 --> 00:32:31,549
- You bet your ass you will.
- You should take the blame.

632
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:34,559
- It was an honest mistake.
- That's not how you find a killer.

633
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,256
- Oh, you know how to find a killer?
- Yeah, I bet I--

634
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,698
Yeah, hey, you know what?
Yeah. I got an idea.

635
00:32:39,856 --> 00:32:40,961
What are you doing?

636
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,160
What are you doing?

637
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:44,272
<i>Good evening, Mr. Buckman.</i>

638
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,704
<i>Thank you for contacting Nav Guide.</i>
<i>My name is Gregory.</i>

639
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,605
<i>How may I be of service this evening?</i>

640
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:52,645
Yeah, we're looking for the most dangerous
bar in the city. Can you help us, please?

641
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,681
-We're going to dinner.
- <i>I'm sorry?</i>

642
00:32:54,838 --> 00:32:58,343
Looking for a bar filled with criminals.
Lowlife thugs, hard-core shitheads.

643
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,853
- What do you got for us?
- Let's go to a restaurant.

644
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:04,721
<i>I'm afraid our listings</i>
<i>are not organized by danger, sir.</i>

645
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:07,863
<i>I see there's an Applebee's</i>
<i>three blocks from your location.</i>

646
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,555
-Perfect.
- No, not really helpful.

647
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,394
They're not the kind of shitheads
we need. Anything else?

648
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,433
<i>I could direct you</i>
<i>to a neighborhood...</i>

649
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,265
<i>...with the greatest</i>
<i>number of carjackings.</i>

650
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:19,237
- Now we're thinking outside the box.
- I wanna go to dinner.

651
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:20,898
-Love it.
- That's probably right.

652
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,273
<i>Very good, sir.</i>
<i>You may wish to lock your doors.</i>

653
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,119
-This is worse than getting pissed on.
- Shh.

654
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,278
- I'd rather be pissed on.
- Jesus.

655
00:33:35,445 --> 00:33:38,153
You weren't kidding, Gregory.
This is, uh, a bad part of town.

656
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,625
You can stay on the line.
You're still there?

657
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,766
- <i>I'm still here, sir.</i>
-Just keep, uh, keep us on the line.

658
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:47,266
I'm always curious about these things,
but is your real name Gregory?

659
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:51,531
<i>Uh, no, sir. My real name is Atmanand.</i>

660
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:53,003
How do you get Gregory from that?

661
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:55,508
<i>Oh. Gregory was assigned to me...</i>

662
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:58,169
- ...<i>by Nav Guide.</i>
- Why not let you use your real name?

663
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,545
<i>They say many Americans</i>
<i>find our real names hard to pronounce.</i>

664
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:03,685
I'm not gonna play
by their rules anymore.

665
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,877
From now on,
I'm gonna call you Ahmenan.

666
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,954
- <i>Atmanand.</i>
-Ammenand.

667
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,920
-Atmanad.
- <i>Atmanand</i>.

668
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,561
I'm gonna call you Gregory,
that name's a nightmare.

669
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,889
- Hey, baby.
- Oh, boy.

670
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:16,760
- You hurt his feelings.
- I didn't.

671
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,922
<i>You have arrived at your destination, sir.</i>

672
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,434
- All right. Well, thanks, Gregory.
- <i>You're welcome.</i>

673
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:31,244
All right. All right, here we go.

674
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:33,980
- This is a really bad idea.
- This is a great idea.

675
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:37,311
- Gonna yell "anybody here kill for money"?
- No.

676
00:34:37,474 --> 00:34:39,715
- That's a terrible plan.
- Follow me. I got this.

677
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:42,289
- Where you going?
- I don't feel we should stay.

678
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,050
All right.

679
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,257
-Bowflex?
- Shut up.

680
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,891
Ah.

681
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:55,262
My man.

682
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,800
Hey, uh, does anyone here
kill people for money?

683
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:01,465
- Kurt.
- The fuck you just say?

684
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,043
No, it's not a race thing.

685
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,512
Uh, I believe that society discriminates
and disenfranchises you folks.

686
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,876
- "You folks"?
-Subtle.

687
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,646
Man, I'm a small-business owner.
Who the hell you calling disenfranchised?

688
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,947
Well, not you in particular,
in that instance.

689
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,887
- Oh, right. You mean all black people.
- Yes.

690
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:19,221
-I'm gonna be in the car.
- Oh, a baseball bat.

691
00:35:19,382 --> 00:35:22,556
Uh, I didn't mean to offend you.
I'm sorry if that's what happened.

692
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,563
My heart's in the right place.

693
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:27,293
In five seconds, your heart
gonna be in the wrong place.

694
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,132
- Four, three, two, let's roll.
- Got it. Okay. Take care.

695
00:35:30,293 --> 00:35:31,931
Have a nice day. Good day to you.

696
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,871
Bye, baby.

697
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,809
Don't say a word. I know, I know.

698
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,574
Hit the button. Hit the button.

699
00:35:40,737 --> 00:35:42,876
- Guys, I don't know. Should we quit?
- Yeah, definitely.

700
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:45,646
- Yo. Think I can help you boys.
- Is that for us?

701
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:49,347
- Here we go.
- Not interested, thank you.

702
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,548
Hey, hey, hey.

703
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,054
Let's follow a strange guy
into a dark corner.

704
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,760
Somebody said y'all looking
for somebody to help with business.

705
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:06,135
- Yep.
- Well, um...

706
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,038
- ...are you a businessman?
- Yeah.

707
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,677
Motherfucker Jones.

708
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,577
- How's that?
- Motherfucker Jones.

709
00:36:14,304 --> 00:36:16,717
Your first name is "Motherfucker"?

710
00:36:16,873 --> 00:36:18,945
Last name Jones.
You got a problem with that?

711
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,615
No. No. Cool name. Yeah. Is that,
like, on your birth certificate too?

712
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,123
No, goofball.

713
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,356
My real name is Dean.

714
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,226
Dean Jones. Same name of
the actor in <i>Herbie, the Love Bug</i>.

715
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:31,594
He won't know who that is.

716
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:33,793
- I know who he is, bitch.
- Sorry.

717
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,565
I can't walk around in this fucking
neighborhood with that Disney-ass name.

718
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:39,599
How'd you get the name
Motherfucker?

719
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,902
When I was a kid, I snuck
into my mother's bedroom.

720
00:36:42,065 --> 00:36:43,306
- Ooh.
- Uh-oh.

721
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,878
- She was laying there naked.
- Dean.

722
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,777
- She had been drinking all night.
- We get it.

723
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:50,077
And then I snuck up behind her,
and then I slipped my fingers...

724
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,954
- ...into her purse.
- Purse? He said "purse."

725
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:57,182
I took her money, the whole week's
pay. I really fucked her over.

726
00:36:57,347 --> 00:37:00,659
And that's how I got the name
Motherfucker Jones.

727
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:01,853
Right.

728
00:37:02,018 --> 00:37:05,000
They should call you Motherfucker-Over
Jones to avoid confusion.

729
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:07,295
- What's the confusion?
- There's no confusion.

730
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,597
We're gonna get back on track here.
Sir, we each have a boss, uh...

731
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,795
...that, you know--

732
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:15,911
There's three bosses, and it would be best
if those bosses maybe were no longer....

733
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:18,239
-No longer around anymore.
- We want them...

734
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,507
- You know?
-...killed.

735
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:23,643
You got the cheese?

736
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:27,851
We got the cheese.
What kind of cheese are you thinking?

737
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,719
- What is that, three hits? That's....
- Yeah.

738
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,293
-Thirty large.
- Whoa.

739
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:37,659
- Hungry.
- That's a lot of cheese.

740
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:38,960
Oh, here's an idea.

741
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,898
If you kill two, could we get
the third one hold the cheese?

742
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,268
It's no negotiations.
Thirty large or nothing.

743
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,876
- That's more cheese than we've got.
- Okay, then. It's five large now.

744
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,371
Then we're in. We're in. We're in. Right?

745
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,643
Hang on. Wouldn't it be awful
if it was traceable back to us?

746
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:59,184
I don't even know your names.

747
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:01,253
- That is rude. This is Dale.
- Don't say my name.

748
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:05,291
Shut the fuck up. Listen. Bring the money
here tomorrow, I'll take care of the rest.

749
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,327
Do you want it in something specific,
a shoebox, duffel bag?

750
00:38:08,485 --> 00:38:10,898
-Just be here with the fucking money.
- Yeah.

751
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:13,432
-Put it in a briefcase.
- Thanks for your time.

752
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,626
Here we go.

753
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:16,793
Is the briefcase coming out of your end?

754
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:54,563
Looks like it's all there.

755
00:39:54,724 --> 00:39:57,103
Didn't even need a briefcase.
It's a small stack.

756
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,969
- We should have used a manila envelope.
- It's all right.

757
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:04,010
What is your projected outside date
of completion, Motherfucker?

758
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,105
Ah.

759
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:11,242
I just got back from doing a dime
for some real nasty shit.

760
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:12,987
- That's 10 years.
- I know.

761
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:16,250
They're looking at me. I'm on probation,
and if I step out of line...

762
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,351
...I'm going back.

763
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,257
- Right.
- Understood.

764
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:25,623
- Period? End of story?
- What does that mean?

765
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:29,260
- Wait. You said you'd take care of this.
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.

766
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:33,875
I'm gonna be your murder consultant.

767
00:40:34,597 --> 00:40:36,771
I'm sorry, but, uh....

768
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:41,643
- No, man. Right? That's not cool.
- You don't shut this fucking hamster up....

769
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,876
- Don't call me a hamster now. Come on.
- Easy, easy.

770
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,282
- It's just upsetting.
- No, it's somewhat accurate.

771
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:48,514
Look, that is not what we talked about,
Motherfucker.

772
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,659
So how about we just take the money
and we'll get out of here?

773
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:53,818
How about you go fuck yourself?
No refunds.

774
00:40:53,983 --> 00:40:57,693
That's $5000. If you think we're just gonna
walk out and let you keep that--

775
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,494
-I think you're forgetting--
Don't go grabbing quickly.

776
00:41:00,657 --> 00:41:01,693
Jesus.

777
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:05,237
Mr. Motherfucker, please,
don't shoot us. Let's just talk it out.

778
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,672
Listen, $5000 is mine.
I don't care what you say.

779
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:10,210
You can take my advice
or get the fuck out of here.

780
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,539
-That's a terrible deal.
- We should listen.

781
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:14,648
-Okay, $5000 worth of advice?
- Yeah.

782
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:16,250
Most killers are first-timers.

783
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,945
You wanna pull off a brilliant murder,
you gotta act like it's an accident.

784
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,181
Failed brakes, gas leaks, suicide.

785
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,418
You do it right, you ain't even
gotta be there when it goes down.

786
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:29,155
Oh, boy. That's five grand worth, huh?

787
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:32,333
- Pretty pedestrian.
- Not really. Obvious information, isn't it?

788
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:35,800
Sounds like Scooby-Doo. How are we
supposed to fake three accidents?

789
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,030
You stalk your prey.

790
00:41:37,193 --> 00:41:41,369
Gotta be smart. Find out where they live,
find out their habits. What's their hobbies?

791
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:44,307
What they like, what food they like,
who they fucking.

792
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:46,175
- Word.
- Find them vulnerable.

793
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:49,784
I have a job, you know?
What's that, surveillance and recon?

794
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,581
That's why we were hiring, because
we wanna sub that out. We have jobs.

795
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,315
Even if you pull it off perfectly...

796
00:41:56,646 --> 00:41:59,059
...if you crackers got motives...

797
00:41:59,215 --> 00:42:00,251
...the popo...

798
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:02,454
- That's police.
- ...will pin it to you.

799
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:05,226
We all have clear motives
for killing our bosses...

800
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:08,393
...so this is not gonna work.
This is garbage.

801
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,063
I got it.

802
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,137
Why don't you kill each other's bosses?

803
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,472
- That's actually a good idea.
- It's not bad.

804
00:42:20,637 --> 00:42:23,141
Yeah, like Hitchcock's
<i>Strangers on a Train</i>, right?

805
00:42:23,306 --> 00:42:26,219
- I didn't see that. They do that?
- Danny DeVito movie. It's funny.

806
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:29,949
That famous Alfred Hitchcock, Danny
DeVito movie. That's the one he's--

807
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,389
Come on. You're thinking of
<i>Throw Momma From the Train</i>.

808
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,621
- That's what it is.
- That I saw.

809
00:42:34,784 --> 00:42:36,889
Good movie.
That's what you're thinking about.

810
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,398
Same idea, though. We kill
each other's bosses, there's no link to us.

811
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,833
Exactly. Five thousand dollars
well spent, right?

812
00:42:42,992 --> 00:42:45,302
- No. Not at all.
- Waste of money.

813
00:42:45,461 --> 00:42:47,135
Well, too fucking bad.

814
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:48,572
Get out.

815
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,403
Hello.

816
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,518
Hey. I'm outside.
You ready to do a little recon?

817
00:42:56,673 --> 00:43:01,019
Yep. Yeah. I have to get Harken
to let me leave a little bit early.

818
00:43:01,177 --> 00:43:04,159
What's the difference? Not like
he'll be your boss much longer.

819
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:05,925
I'll be down in three minutes.

820
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,858
Three minutes it is. Bye.
He'll be down in three minutes.

821
00:43:09,018 --> 00:43:13,592
- Dude, these seats are crazy comfortable.
- Look at this. I know, it's so good. Ah.

822
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:17,130
The worst report I have ever read
in my life, you nimwit.

823
00:43:17,293 --> 00:43:19,034
You're such a fucking dweeb.

824
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:23,876
Do you have a parking space?
Because I'm gonna take it away from you.

825
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:27,106
Who is it, like your mother-in-law
that knows my wife?

826
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,376
How you got this fucking job,
I don't even understand.

827
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,789
Ugh.

828
00:43:36,045 --> 00:43:37,956
What the hell?

829
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:42,257
Sorry, everybody. I've been fighting
that bug all day. Let me get back to work.

830
00:43:42,418 --> 00:43:46,298
No, no, no. You're disgusting. Go home.
I don't want you getting anyone else sick.

831
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:48,197
Probably best.

832
00:43:49,425 --> 00:43:52,463
Take all your work with you
and have it on my desk 6 a.m. Monday.

833
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,132
- You got it. Thank you, Mr. Harken.
- Jesus Christ.

834
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:58,541
- Don't forget to take your fucking trash can.
- Yeah. No, that's mine.

835
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:01,114
You goddamn barfing pig.

836
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,045
Evens are over here.

837
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:10,420
I know, but sometimes on some
streets evens are on the opposite side.

838
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,615
Never.

839
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:14,057
Never have and they never will.
There it is, 428.

840
00:44:14,217 --> 00:44:16,789
- Which one, which one?
-Don't stop right in front of it.

841
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,730
Stop right here. Right here, right here.

842
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:23,335
Okay, boys.

843
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:28,170
We wait till Pellit makes a move,
then we tail him, all right?

844
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:29,936
- It is on like Donkey Kong.
- Ha, ha.

845
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:32,739
- Hells yeah, man.
- Here we go, huh?

846
00:44:32,902 --> 00:44:34,813
I'm fucking pumped.

847
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,648
Oh, my God. This sucks.

848
00:44:40,143 --> 00:44:42,146
This is horrible, man.

849
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,351
Are we even sure this guy's home?

850
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,458
- Let's go check this out.
- Yeah, we should probably look, right?

851
00:44:54,891 --> 00:44:56,393
Shh.

852
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:57,664
Oh, my God.

853
00:44:57,827 --> 00:44:59,637
What do you wanna do?
What's the plan?

854
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:03,438
- Let's look through this window right here.
- No, no. No, let's ring the bell.

855
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,706
You're not gonna ring the bell.
Look through the window right here.

856
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:10,146
Chances are, he's not home.
I haven't seen any activity in this house--

857
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:13,288
What are you doing?
You're not gonna ring the doorbell.

858
00:45:18,815 --> 00:45:20,295
Whoo-hoo!

859
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,023
-Come on. Come on.
- Dale, Dale, Dale.

860
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,773
I didn't make it in.

861
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:38,202
I'm sorry, guys. Didn't make it in.

862
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:39,472
You in?

863
00:45:39,635 --> 00:45:43,106
Yeah, I'm okay. Jesus Christ,
the guy owns a fucking bear?

864
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,012
- We're breaking and entering here.
- I know. Shh. Oh, look at this.

865
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,721
Look at this place. It's awful.
It's like a douchebag museum.

866
00:45:52,215 --> 00:45:54,992
It's like we stepped inside
the mind of an asshole.

867
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:57,626
Shit. He's got a foosball table.

868
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:00,530
Dale! Don't touch anything.
Get your hands off that.

869
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:02,998
- Fingerprints.
- Yeah, fingerprints.

870
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:06,471
-God. We should be wearing gloves.
- We don't have-- Oh, here. I know.

871
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,507
Use your sleeves. Use your sleeves.

872
00:46:08,664 --> 00:46:10,371
- For what?
- Use them for gloves.

873
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:13,481
- Come on.
- I can see my fingerprints from here.

874
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:16,617
- What do we do? What's the plan?
- We're here to get some intel.

875
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:18,650
- "Intel"?
- It's short for "intelligence."

876
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,346
- I know what it stands for.
- Then why did you ask?

877
00:46:21,577 --> 00:46:23,887
Why are we talking
about this? Let's split up.

878
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,824
In and out, in and out. We'll find something
good, and we're in and out of here.

879
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:31,626
- Stop chatting and start looking.
-We're committing a crime. This is a crime.

880
00:46:32,054 --> 00:46:33,625
Whoa.

881
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,507
-Nick.
- Yeah?

882
00:46:38,661 --> 00:46:42,199
- Now, this would count as intel, right?
- Holy shit, that's a lot of cocaine.

883
00:46:42,365 --> 00:46:44,242
Have you ever seen this much cocaine?

884
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,539
That's gotta be worth,
what, 10, 15,000--?

885
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:51,315
Oh, I blew it. I blew that, didn't I?

886
00:46:52,909 --> 00:46:54,411
Hmm.

887
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,963
- Don't inhale.
-Grab the box. I'll scoop it in.

888
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,902
I really don't wanna touch it.
I don't have sleeve-gloves.

889
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:14,405
Get something to-- Ugh. I'll scoop it in.

890
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:15,804
So bitter.

891
00:47:23,472 --> 00:47:25,213
Hmm.

892
00:47:32,815 --> 00:47:35,592
In the butt you go, go, go.

893
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,161
There you go.

894
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,391
Big scoop.

895
00:47:40,556 --> 00:47:42,628
All right, let me try this. Look out.

896
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,739
- Yeah, that better work.
- Watch out.

897
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:47,099
There you go.

898
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,606
- I don't know.
- Go slow.

899
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:52,302
Get on the couch. Stop helping.

900
00:47:56,739 --> 00:47:58,777
All right.

901
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,355
In you go.

902
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:05,786
Ooh.

903
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:15,496
You probably should have
emptied the DustBuster first.

904
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:20,565
Is that what you think?

905
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,175
I was thinking that.
On account of the dust.

906
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:29,108
Well, I've heard of butt floss,
but this is ridiculous. Ha, ha.

907
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:30,980
- Get a sifter, or a--
- Colander.

908
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,177
Colander would be good.

909
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:35,411
And I'll start picking.

910
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,753
That'll do.

911
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,858
I feel like everything'll work out.
I'm like a machine. Look how fast I am.

912
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:51,302
I'm moving super fast.
I can't even feel my nose.

913
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,737
Wanna know what's weird?
I should be panicking...

914
00:48:53,896 --> 00:48:56,275
...and I am a little,
but it's in a very good way.

915
00:48:56,432 --> 00:48:59,208
It's a good kind of panic
because I feel like I wanna die...

916
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,644
- ...but I also feel very, very, very good.
- Yeah.

917
00:49:01,804 --> 00:49:03,715
Hey! What are you guys doing?

918
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:06,480
Nothing. But before we go,
I wanna take one more dump.

919
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:09,817
Take a dump and I'm gonna
do push-ups. Because I gotta get fit.

920
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,222
What the hell have you guys done?

921
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,425
I'm feeling good, dude.
Wanna help me clean?

922
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,586
We bond over this.
This is friendship stuff.

923
00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:21,224
We broke into someone's house.
It's the most amazing experience of my life.

924
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:25,271
We broke into a man's house. Suddenly,
I'm like an expert at sifting cocaine.

925
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,534
It's amazing.
Come here and help me with this.

926
00:49:27,797 --> 00:49:29,402
Can't believe we weren't prepared.

927
00:49:29,565 --> 00:49:31,909
That was completely dangerous,
a total waste of time.

928
00:49:32,068 --> 00:49:35,481
Well, no. Actually, not a total waste
of time. Look what I got.

929
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,016
- Not bad, huh?
- What is that?

930
00:49:37,173 --> 00:49:39,085
-Is this his phone?
- That's his phone.

931
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,686
-You steal this?
- I sure did.

932
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,222
- It's got his contacts, schedule.
- Very nice.

933
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,688
- No.
- What do you mean, "no"?

934
00:49:44,847 --> 00:49:47,885
That's a crime. Pfft. Nope. Ha.
No one said we'd be stealing.

935
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:50,724
- This is a good grab.
- We broke in! You guys did cocaine!

936
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:53,833
- Right. Two-- Three crimes.
- He's all jitzed out. Ignore him.

937
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,800
We're in the process of
getting ready to kill three people...

938
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,371
...and you're giving me shit
about stealing a phone?

939
00:49:59,528 --> 00:50:01,599
Run it by me
if you'll be stealing stuff.

940
00:50:01,764 --> 00:50:03,175
- Run it by you?
- Run it by me!

941
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,438
- Nick, will you hold this for a second?
- What are you doing?

942
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,014
"Run"? I'm not gonna run
anything by you.

943
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,583
I'm not gonna run anything by you.
Dickhead.

944
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,347
- There's a lot of stuff in here.
- I know.

945
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,650
- Wanna go check out your boss now?
- Yeah, I guess we should.

946
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:21,585
- You don't punch the driver!
- You don't punch the fucking driver.

947
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:25,199
I'm coked out of my fucking brain.
I'll punch whoever the fuck I want to.

948
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:43,472
Let's do this, guys. Feeling good.

949
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:46,313
- Be very quiet out there.
- Calm down, Dale.

950
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,217
You know what? Hang on a second.

951
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:52,291
Dale? Dude, hold it. Last time the three
of us did this, it was very messy.

952
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,724
- It was awesome, exciting.
- It was clunky as hell.

953
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:58,889
Here's what we'll do. In the event that
Harken is not here, just me and Kurt go in.

954
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,501
You'll stay out here, not go in,
and be our lookout.

955
00:51:01,657 --> 00:51:04,661
What? Are you kidding me?
That's awesome. I love that. The lookout.

956
00:51:04,827 --> 00:51:06,967
- I don't know what the guy looks like.
- Doesn't matter.

957
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,269
You see anybody, just assume
that it's Harken, send us a signal.

958
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,106
- Okay? Have a seat.
- Okay.

959
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:15,909
Okay. Send a sig--
I'm gonna honk the horn six times.

960
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,710
- Goddamn it. No.
- Did he say "six"?

961
00:51:17,873 --> 00:51:20,251
- Something much more subtle.
- That's too many.

962
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:22,856
- More subtle? Four honks?
- Can you honk once?

963
00:51:23,012 --> 00:51:24,492
- Are you kidding?
- Not at all.

964
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:27,094
People honk once all the time.
You'll be in and out--

965
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,322
- We'll know it's you.
- Come on, man. Dale, two honks.

966
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:33,695
That kind of tone's gonna get you nowhere.
All right, two honks.

967
00:51:33,856 --> 00:51:36,530
- Just two honks. A little tap, tap.
- Okay.

968
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:41,141
Two very long, very slow honks.

969
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:46,376
- I'm gonna check this window over here.
- Okay.

970
00:51:50,172 --> 00:51:54,211
- There's nothing on that side.
-Yeah. I don't think there's anyone in there.

971
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,190
I think he's definitely out.

972
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:59,556
Maybe we can find a way in upstairs.

973
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:03,155
Yeah, or maybe there's a window open.

974
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:09,036
Or better yet....

975
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,128
That makes things easier, huh?

976
00:52:11,293 --> 00:52:13,398
I like the way you think. Move.

977
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,509
- No, don't do that. Hey! God!
- Oh, shit.

978
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:17,067
I broke a rock.

979
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:19,873
Please tell me you realize
that was a key thingy.

980
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:23,074
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

981
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:25,481
You weren't gonna
throw a rock through the door?

982
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:27,643
No, of course not.
No, I wanted to open it.

983
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,052
Like a real cat burglar.

984
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:34,295
Wow.

985
00:52:34,617 --> 00:52:36,722
Just recon, now, okay?

986
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:40,391
Hey, take this. I don't want it.
I want my hands free.

987
00:52:40,556 --> 00:52:42,365
You broke it.

988
00:52:48,898 --> 00:52:49,934
I feel the intel--

989
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,802
- God!
-Okay, just a cat.

990
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,003
Out of nowhere.

991
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,708
Just a cat. We're all right.
Let's look upstairs. Come on.

992
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,221
<i>They call me hell</i>

993
00:53:00,376 --> 00:53:01,650
<i>They call me Stacey</i>

994
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,949
<i>That's not my name</i>
<i>That's not my name</i>

995
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:07,027
<i>That's not my name</i>
<i>That's not my name</i>

996
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,322
<i>They call me hell</i>

997
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,657
<i>They call me her</i>

998
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:11,126
<i>They call me hell</i>

999
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,561
<i>They call me Stacey</i>

1000
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:15,396
<i>That's not my name</i>
<i>That's not my name</i>

1001
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,108
Oh! Goddamn it.

1002
00:53:27,269 --> 00:53:28,943
Jesus, how many cats do they have?

1003
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,244
- It's the same one, I think. Yeah.
- Really?

1004
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,751
Quick little bugger, huh?

1005
00:53:33,909 --> 00:53:34,945
Hey.

1006
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,614
-Shit, is that Harken's wife?
- Yeah, that's her.

1007
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,090
- Oh, man, she is hot.
- She sure is. Here we go.

1008
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,356
I'd like to bend her over a barrel
and show her the 50 states.

1009
00:53:43,652 --> 00:53:46,394
- I don't know what that means.
- Ah, it's a saying.

1010
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:50,003
- I don't think so.
- No, it is, it is. Yeah. No, people say that.

1011
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:52,936
- I haven't heard it.
- I've definitely heard people say that.

1012
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,302
I'm not gonna argue.
Let's continue the recon.

1013
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:58,378
- Well, it's definitely a phrase.
-It sure isn't.

1014
00:53:58,534 --> 00:54:01,744
Yeah, it is. It's from a book.
<i>The Great Gatsby, maybe?</i>

1015
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:05,717
Let's just look for an address book
or a day planner or something. You know?

1016
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,822
You know, it's too bad we're not looking
for cats. These people fucking love cats.

1017
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:33,135
Hey, schmuckface.

1018
00:54:36,237 --> 00:54:40,652
You wanna tell me what you're doing
littering on my street?

1019
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:44,278
I think what happened, ahem, was that
the wind blew it out of my hand.

1020
00:54:44,445 --> 00:54:46,789
I don't care if the wind
blew it out of your twat.

1021
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:51,125
Why don't you take this piece-of-shit car
and get off my fucking block.

1022
00:54:51,286 --> 00:54:55,132
I don't know why you're mad at the car.
I don't think we should get hostile now.

1023
00:54:55,289 --> 00:54:57,132
"Hostile"? You wanna see hostile?

1024
00:54:57,291 --> 00:54:58,998
How about I go in my house
and I get my--?

1025
00:55:00,362 --> 00:55:01,840
What are--?
What's going on with you?

1026
00:55:03,065 --> 00:55:04,543
Peanuts.

1027
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:06,474
"Penis"?

1028
00:55:07,101 --> 00:55:08,512
Oh, peanuts.

1029
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,844
That was a peanut butter sandwich.
Are you not good with peanuts?

1030
00:55:12,007 --> 00:55:14,851
What are you pointing at?
What's going on? What's here?

1031
00:55:15,344 --> 00:55:17,346
Oh, I got it! What do I do? What do I do?

1032
00:55:17,813 --> 00:55:21,157
"Check the needle, pump back, pump--"
Okay, hold on. I'm a slow reader.

1033
00:55:21,315 --> 00:55:22,818
"Hold the pump--" Okay, okay!

1034
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:25,521
Jab it in your chest. Okay.
I got you, dude. Ready?

1035
00:55:30,025 --> 00:55:31,231
How you feeling, you good?

1036
00:55:31,393 --> 00:55:33,702
You good? Did I get you? Did I get you?

1037
00:55:36,898 --> 00:55:40,108
Whoa. Whoa. Dude, come here. Hurry.

1038
00:55:40,268 --> 00:55:41,804
Look at this.

1039
00:55:44,206 --> 00:55:46,846
- Is that Harken? Dale's killing Harken?
- That's Harken?

1040
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:48,851
I'm gonna hit you again, okay?

1041
00:55:49,878 --> 00:55:51,789
- What is he doing?
-He's really doing it?

1042
00:55:51,947 --> 00:55:54,257
- This is the recon stage.
- Holy shit.

1043
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:57,056
We gotta get out of here.
Come on, we gotta go. Oh, God.

1044
00:56:00,222 --> 00:56:01,326
I'm pushing on it. Okay.

1045
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:05,297
What about little jabs? Little jabs?

1046
00:56:05,494 --> 00:56:06,733
Do I get your neck?

1047
00:56:08,764 --> 00:56:10,300
Was that good?

1048
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:15,139
Come on, man!

1049
00:56:15,304 --> 00:56:16,338
Oh, my God.

1050
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:17,777
Hey, hey! Come here!

1051
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:21,318
What's going on? What are you doing?
What's happened?

1052
00:56:21,476 --> 00:56:24,047
I think he's okay! I hit him
with this. Do you know him?

1053
00:56:24,211 --> 00:56:27,681
Of course, he's my husband. Sweetie?
Honey? Sweetheart, are you okay?

1054
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:32,992
- There he is. Hey.
- Ah. What did you do to me?

1055
00:56:33,155 --> 00:56:36,135
I saved you with your thingy.
It was incredible.

1056
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:38,668
Oh, my God, sweetie.
He saved your life.

1057
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:39,896
You saved his life.

1058
00:56:40,728 --> 00:56:42,298
Okay. That's cool.

1059
00:56:42,463 --> 00:56:44,501
- What's with the hugging?
- Saved your life!

1060
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:49,172
Oh, sweetie, I am just so grateful
that he was here. You could have died.

1061
00:56:49,338 --> 00:56:51,681
-I'm sure you are grateful he's here.
- Yes, I am.

1062
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,648
- You know this guy?
- No, I don't.

1063
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:57,153
Are you fucking this guy? What were
you doing, waiting to fuck my wife?

1064
00:56:57,311 --> 00:57:00,054
Dude, I just met your wife.
You want your thing back?

1065
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:04,094
- You better get out of here.
- No problem.

1066
00:57:04,251 --> 00:57:06,425
Dave. Dave, what are you--? Honey?

1067
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:10,364
Honey, you should be thanking this young
man. Why are you being so suspicious?

1068
00:57:10,525 --> 00:57:12,367
Why? You know why I'm being suspicious.

1069
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:14,005
Because I know you sleep
around on me.

1070
00:57:15,364 --> 00:57:16,398
That's ridiculous.

1071
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:18,202
What about the way
you look at Maurilio?

1072
00:57:20,434 --> 00:57:23,347
You realize we're all going to jail
because of that idiot?

1073
00:57:23,505 --> 00:57:26,543
Man, I can't go to jail. Look at me.
I'll get raped like crazy.

1074
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:27,947
Fuck, me too.

1075
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,952
Yeah, totally.

1076
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,086
I'd get raped just as much
as you would, Kurt.

1077
00:57:34,248 --> 00:57:36,525
- Do you think you're more rape-able?
- I'm not saying that.

1078
00:57:37,885 --> 00:57:40,059
- You're pretty close to saying--
- Oh, fuck.

1079
00:57:46,827 --> 00:57:49,331
Holy shit.
Did you guys see me out there?

1080
00:57:49,498 --> 00:57:50,976
Yeah, we saw you, Dale.

1081
00:57:51,132 --> 00:57:53,112
Shh. Yeah, we saw that.

1082
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:54,541
How cool was that?

1083
00:57:54,702 --> 00:57:57,478
It wasn't cool at all.
We come out to gather information...

1084
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:00,916
...and you start stabbing Harken to death
in front of the neighborhood?

1085
00:58:01,076 --> 00:58:03,317
- Harken?
- Who'd you think you were stabbing?

1086
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:04,650
I wasn't stabbing anyone.

1087
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:08,521
He had an allergic reaction to some peanuts
and I rescued him, know what I mean?

1088
00:58:08,684 --> 00:58:10,686
He had a little allergy shot on him
and I--

1089
00:58:10,885 --> 00:58:13,923
I mean, I jabbed him with that,
but I was just saving his life.

1090
00:58:14,088 --> 00:58:15,864
-Saved a man's life.
- Hang on a second.

1091
00:58:16,023 --> 00:58:18,594
So my boss, who we're
thinking about planning to kill...

1092
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,262
...is dying in front of you
and you saved his life?

1093
00:58:21,429 --> 00:58:23,876
Well, that sounds bad
when you say it like that.

1094
00:58:24,032 --> 00:58:26,307
- Can you open the door?
- That's not cool.

1095
00:58:26,467 --> 00:58:29,005
-But I didn't know it was Harken.
- Hit the button.

1096
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:31,447
This is why I need to know
what people look like.

1097
00:58:31,606 --> 00:58:33,278
You're mad at me for killing him....

1098
00:58:33,442 --> 00:58:35,422
Can we give him a time-out?
For one second.

1099
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:37,818
Make up your fucking mind. It's like--

1100
00:58:37,978 --> 00:58:39,014
What is this?

1101
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:41,525
You gotta admit
we got some good intel tonight.

1102
00:58:41,682 --> 00:58:45,096
Harken is allergic to peanuts
and Pellit's got a huge stash of cocaine.

1103
00:58:45,253 --> 00:58:46,527
Are you playing this game?

1104
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:50,864
So all we gotta do is figure a way to get
peanuts somewhere into Harken's house...

1105
00:58:51,025 --> 00:58:52,972
...and put some poison in Pellit's coke.

1106
00:58:53,128 --> 00:58:56,268
It's easy for someone to think
Pellit got a bad batch of cocaine.

1107
00:58:56,431 --> 00:58:59,536
You seriously locking me
out of the car like we're in 8th grade?

1108
00:58:59,701 --> 00:59:02,443
What about Harken? Probably
always got that injector thing.

1109
00:59:02,603 --> 00:59:03,981
Doesn't shower with it.

1110
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:06,449
So then we'll put some peanuts
inside his shampoo.

1111
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:09,315
A couple of fatal accidents
we're not even there for.

1112
00:59:09,478 --> 00:59:12,014
- Motherfucker Jones would be so proud.
- Yeah, he would.

1113
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:14,853
- Getting old.
- What do you do about dummy's boss?

1114
00:59:15,016 --> 00:59:17,655
I'll stake her out tomorrow
and get to the bottom of it.

1115
00:59:17,818 --> 00:59:20,697
- A man has his limits.
-That left a fucking dent.

1116
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:24,831
Get him fucking home.

1117
00:59:24,992 --> 00:59:29,065
Very funny. That was very funny, guys.

1118
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:31,733
We have one thing to figure out,
if you can help us.

1119
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,278
If Nick and I were in prison,
who do you think would get raped more?

1120
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:37,311
Nick.

1121
00:59:37,472 --> 00:59:40,452
Really? Why?

1122
00:59:40,675 --> 00:59:43,713
It's about weakness and vulnerability.
It's not a looks thing.

1123
00:59:43,878 --> 00:59:45,085
It probably would be Nick.

1124
00:59:45,246 --> 00:59:48,489
Getting locked out of the car
is bullshit, man.

1125
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,771
That's an awesome deal.

1126
01:00:40,568 --> 01:00:43,641
Jesus, Dale. It's a murder,
not a cocktail party.

1127
01:00:43,804 --> 01:00:46,251
I know. You don't have to
announce that to the world.

1128
01:00:46,407 --> 01:00:49,411
There was a great deal on nuts.
I'm not gonna pass up on savings.

1129
01:00:49,577 --> 01:00:50,784
Okay, so this is it.

1130
01:00:50,945 --> 01:00:55,190
I'm doing Pellit, you're gonna do Harken,
and you'll get some intel from Julia, right?

1131
01:00:55,416 --> 01:00:57,920
- Copy that.
- Okay. See you on the other side.

1132
01:01:28,315 --> 01:01:29,760
Okay.

1133
01:01:34,322 --> 01:01:36,199
- Thank you, Kimmy.
- You're welcome.

1134
01:01:36,925 --> 01:01:37,960
That was great.

1135
01:01:38,126 --> 01:01:40,436
- See you next time.
- Yeah.

1136
01:01:40,594 --> 01:01:43,974
-Thank you, Bill.
- Thank you, Bobby.

1137
01:01:51,773 --> 01:01:53,376
What?

1138
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:55,317
Whew.

1139
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:57,246
Oh.

1140
01:02:04,585 --> 01:02:05,929
Shit.

1141
01:02:07,655 --> 01:02:09,567
-Hey.
- <i>How's it going over there?</i>

1142
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:13,065
-What do you know about Julia?
- <i>I learned I gotta switch dentists...</i>

1143
01:02:13,228 --> 01:02:15,230
...because this woman
is unbelievably hot.

1144
01:02:15,396 --> 01:02:18,606
- <i>How's it going over there?</i>
- Uh, it's--

1145
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:23,405
Just-- I'm waiting for, you know,
Pellit to sleep or leave or....

1146
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:26,050
Just-- Just waiting.

1147
01:02:26,206 --> 01:02:28,949
Wonder what, uh,
Dale's doing with Harken.

1148
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:30,851
<i>It's gonna be really hard.</i>

1149
01:02:31,012 --> 01:02:34,858
<i>And we'll have to work at this every day,</i>
<i>but I wanna do that because I want you.</i>

1150
01:02:35,016 --> 01:02:38,360
<i>I want all of you forever, you and me,</i>
<i>every day--</i>

1151
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:58,447
<i>Everybody was kung-fu fighting</i>

1152
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,117
<i>Everybody was kung-fu fighting</i>

1153
01:03:05,213 --> 01:03:06,817
Give me that.

1154
01:03:06,981 --> 01:03:08,722
Give it to me.

1155
01:03:27,202 --> 01:03:31,172
Jesus. Where does this guy
get the energy?

1156
01:03:34,409 --> 01:03:36,012
Oh, yeah.

1157
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:56,400
What the fuck was that?

1158
01:04:02,836 --> 01:04:05,681
Okay. Okay.

1159
01:04:10,744 --> 01:04:14,056
Okay. Okay.

1160
01:04:19,153 --> 01:04:22,067
- Yeah, Dale?
- I don't think I can do this.

1161
01:04:22,757 --> 01:04:25,532
<i>Look, I know</i>
<i>you really hate Harken but...</i>

1162
01:04:26,427 --> 01:04:28,271
...I don't think
I can go through with it.

1163
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:29,465
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1164
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:32,702
I know. I've been thinking
the same thing.

1165
01:04:32,867 --> 01:04:35,438
<i>-Yeah, let's just call it off.</i>
-What the fuck?

1166
01:04:35,603 --> 01:04:37,742
- What?
- It's Harken. He's here.

1167
01:04:37,905 --> 01:04:38,976
<i>He's at Pellit's? Why?</i>

1168
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:41,643
I don't know. He's walking
right up to the front door.

1169
01:04:42,077 --> 01:04:44,853
- <i>You think he's onto us?</i>
- How the fuck do I know?

1170
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,226
Knock a little louder?

1171
01:04:47,382 --> 01:04:48,416
What? What?

1172
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,123
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ,
Harken just shot Pellit.

1173
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:55,666
<i>Are you sure?</i>

1174
01:04:55,824 --> 01:04:59,202
Holy shit. Pellit opened up the door,
Harken shot him in the chest...

1175
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,532
...he fell down, he shot him again
in the head.

1176
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:05,268
<i>He shot him? Wait, what's going on?</i>
<i>I don't understand. He shot him?</i>

1177
01:05:05,432 --> 01:05:07,469
<i>Nick? Say something.</i>
<i>Nick, Nick.</i>

1178
01:05:07,635 --> 01:05:10,844
<i>Nick! Nick, Nick, talk to me.</i>
<i>Nick, what's happening?</i>

1179
01:05:11,005 --> 01:05:12,108
What's going on?

1180
01:05:12,273 --> 01:05:14,753
- <i>How's Pellit doing?</i>
- Still pretty fucking dead, Dale.

1181
01:05:22,016 --> 01:05:25,963
I gotta get out of here before somebody
sees me. Meet me at the bar. I'll call Kurt.

1182
01:05:26,121 --> 01:05:27,532
Yeah. I'll meet you there.

1183
01:05:27,688 --> 01:05:31,603
I might throw up a couple times in the toilet
here, but then I'll meet you there.

1184
01:05:33,994 --> 01:05:35,065
Oh.

1185
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:36,538
Oh, Toyota.

1186
01:05:47,574 --> 01:05:49,282
Stay calm. We'll figure this out.

1187
01:05:49,443 --> 01:05:51,445
"Calm"?
I saw a guy get shot an hour ago.

1188
01:05:51,612 --> 01:05:55,117
- I know. A guy you were gonna kill anyway.
- Listen, I don't know about that.

1189
01:05:55,315 --> 01:05:56,989
- What?
- Don't know if I had it in me.

1190
01:05:57,152 --> 01:05:59,222
I freaked out and panicked,
got out of there.

1191
01:05:59,387 --> 01:06:01,833
Are you kidding?
You can't change a plan like this--

1192
01:06:01,989 --> 01:06:03,025
I'm not a murderer.

1193
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:06,195
You think when it came down to it,
you'd be able to kill Julia?

1194
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:10,206
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
It is a little hard to imagine killing her now.

1195
01:06:10,364 --> 01:06:13,471
-"Now"?
- Wait, what does that mean?

1196
01:06:13,635 --> 01:06:15,239
- Did you sleep with her?
- No, no.

1197
01:06:15,402 --> 01:06:17,815
- Tell me you didn't sleep with her.
-You're a mess.

1198
01:06:17,972 --> 01:06:20,248
But this time it wasn't my fault,
I swear to God.

1199
01:06:20,407 --> 01:06:22,786
You will be a suspect
if you try and kill her now.

1200
01:06:22,943 --> 01:06:25,981
At first I was surveilling her,
like I was asked to do.

1201
01:06:26,146 --> 01:06:30,322
- She's incredibly hot, by the way. So hot.
- Don't talk about how hot she is, bastard.

1202
01:06:30,485 --> 01:06:32,692
Next thing,
she starts deliberately undressing.

1203
01:06:32,853 --> 01:06:33,889
<i>Come on.</i>

1204
01:06:34,054 --> 01:06:36,001
<i>In front of her window with the lights on.</i>

1205
01:06:36,157 --> 01:06:38,568
-<i>Like she knew I was watching.</i>
- <i>"Deliberately undressed"?</i>

1206
01:06:38,726 --> 01:06:40,898
<i>Slowly, seductively,</i>
<i>lot of shoulder moves...</i>

1207
01:06:41,061 --> 01:06:42,938
...is clearly putting on a show.

1208
01:06:43,097 --> 01:06:46,010
-<i>Next she makes herself a little snack.</i>
- <i>She have a nice chest?</i>

1209
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:47,202
<i>A Popsicle.</i>

1210
01:06:47,367 --> 01:06:48,938
-<i>Then a banana.</i>
- <i>Come on.</i>

1211
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:52,641
-<i>And finally, a hot dog. I mean, come on.</i>
- <i>Now I don't believe your story.</i>

1212
01:06:52,806 --> 01:06:55,686
Three penis-shaped foods,
that can't be a coincidence, right?

1213
01:06:55,842 --> 01:06:58,449
Eating them in that weird order?
Not a proper meal.

1214
01:06:58,612 --> 01:06:59,682
It's cold to hot.

1215
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:02,760
Fine. So you took the penis foods
as an invitation to fuck her.

1216
01:07:02,916 --> 01:07:06,728
<i>No, no. God, no. I took her invitation</i>
<i>to fuck her as an invitation to fuck her.</i>

1217
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,197
<i>She lured me in. It was</i>
<i>like one of these things.</i>

1218
01:07:09,356 --> 01:07:11,860
- <i>Something clinically wrong with you.</i>
- <i>You're a whore.</i>

1219
01:07:12,025 --> 01:07:14,869
<i>Come on. That's not nice, okay?</i>
<i>Look, your problem's solved.</i>

1220
01:07:15,028 --> 01:07:16,530
She won't mess with you anymore.

1221
01:07:16,697 --> 01:07:19,338
Can we move on?
Let's talk about what happened to Pellit.

1222
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:23,175
All right, okay. Let me think. Okay,
here's what I'm thinking. Here's my idea.

1223
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:25,750
We call the cops
with an anonymous tip. All right?

1224
01:07:25,907 --> 01:07:27,943
We tell them Harken killed Pellit. Boom.

1225
01:07:28,108 --> 01:07:31,556
Harken's in jail, Pellit's in hell,
Julia's had the crazy fucked out of her...

1226
01:07:31,713 --> 01:07:33,920
...and all three of us
have our problems solved.

1227
01:07:34,081 --> 01:07:36,322
It could work. An anonymous tip,
that's not bad.

1228
01:07:36,483 --> 01:07:37,518
Mm-hm.

1229
01:07:37,684 --> 01:07:40,632
Gotta be from a pay phone, though,
so it's not traced back to us.

1230
01:07:40,788 --> 01:07:43,826
- Exactly.
- Good. Let's take my car. Let's do it.

1231
01:07:44,858 --> 01:07:47,532
All right. Where do you even
find a pay phone these days?

1232
01:07:47,695 --> 01:07:49,675
There's a ton at the bus station for sure.

1233
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:52,641
Oh, yeah, I guess that's a good point.
Maybe the mall.

1234
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,244
What is this?

1235
01:07:54,635 --> 01:07:57,411
- What is this?
- Is that for us?

1236
01:07:57,572 --> 01:07:59,710
- What?
-Oh, shit.

1237
01:08:07,481 --> 01:08:09,257
All the way down.

1238
01:08:10,684 --> 01:08:12,289
Right there.

1239
01:08:13,987 --> 01:08:17,697
- Are you the owner of this vehicle?
- I own it. Yup.

1240
01:08:17,891 --> 01:08:23,274
We got an APB on a gray Toyota Prius,
license 2-Whiskey-Alpha-Quincy-2-3-3.

1241
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:24,671
- How come?
- Hang on, man.

1242
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:26,811
- Did I talk to you?
- No.

1243
01:08:27,234 --> 01:08:29,943
That's this car. Tell me how I can help.

1244
01:08:30,104 --> 01:08:33,176
A traffic cam caught this car
fleeing the scene of a crime tonight.

1245
01:08:33,341 --> 01:08:36,810
- Would you know anything about that?
- I don't know why it would do that.

1246
01:08:37,244 --> 01:08:40,225
I mean, I don't know. What happened?

1247
01:08:40,381 --> 01:08:42,417
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

1248
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:43,989
I smell alcohol.

1249
01:08:44,152 --> 01:08:46,359
- This guy and the mouth in the back.
- That's me.

1250
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:49,795
I'm gonna need you
to follow us to the station.

1251
01:08:49,957 --> 01:08:51,162
Officer.

1252
01:08:51,525 --> 01:08:52,663
My man.

1253
01:08:54,729 --> 01:08:58,801
I cannot believe I let you talk me into
this whole thing. I cannot believe it.

1254
01:08:58,966 --> 01:09:01,104
Are you kidding me?
We were being hypothetical.

1255
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:03,613
- Being hypothetical?
- You're the one that pushed us into it.

1256
01:09:07,942 --> 01:09:11,980
Do you wanna explain
why you were doing 61 in a 25 zone...

1257
01:09:12,145 --> 01:09:14,353
...one block from the victim's house...

1258
01:09:14,515 --> 01:09:16,688
...just moments after he got shot dead?

1259
01:09:18,286 --> 01:09:19,525
I was drag racing.

1260
01:09:20,688 --> 01:09:23,635
- I'm a drag racer.
- You were drag racing?

1261
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:24,860
Mm.

1262
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,095
In a Prius?

1263
01:09:30,497 --> 01:09:31,601
I don't win a lot.

1264
01:09:31,765 --> 01:09:34,109
Here's what I don't understand.

1265
01:09:34,268 --> 01:09:36,475
You were at the crime scene.

1266
01:09:36,636 --> 01:09:40,948
Hour later we find the car. You happened to
be hanging with this freaky motherfucker.

1267
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:43,918
- A registered sex offender.
- It was an empty playground.

1268
01:09:44,078 --> 01:09:48,220
And this guy. Who happens to be working
for Pellit Chemicals, the victim's company.

1269
01:09:48,682 --> 01:09:50,094
What?

1270
01:09:51,452 --> 01:09:52,692
My boss was murdered?

1271
01:09:53,554 --> 01:09:58,935
Oh, wow. What were you doing at his
house, Nick? Why were you there?

1272
01:09:59,961 --> 01:10:02,463
Where were you during the murder?

1273
01:10:03,096 --> 01:10:07,011
I was making love.
I was making love to a woman.

1274
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:09,306
Yeah. Murdering some ass.

1275
01:10:10,637 --> 01:10:13,208
-Detectives....
- No, uh, I have a question.

1276
01:10:13,373 --> 01:10:16,047
If one of us knew, you know,
who the shooter was...

1277
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:20,555
...and he was willing to
serve you that perp on a platter...

1278
01:10:21,215 --> 01:10:24,685
...he would be entitled
to some sort of immunity, right?

1279
01:10:24,851 --> 01:10:27,695
No. He would be entitled
to some jail time.

1280
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:30,692
If he knew who the shooter was
and didn't tell us...

1281
01:10:30,858 --> 01:10:32,734
...that would be obstruction of justice.

1282
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,802
Glad none of us
know who the shooter is.

1283
01:10:34,962 --> 01:10:40,070
Listen, if you think we're gonna believe
that this is all just a big coincidence...

1284
01:10:40,234 --> 01:10:42,407
...we're gonna be here for a long time.

1285
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:49,278
Okay, wait. By saying
"we're gonna be here for a long time"...

1286
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:52,720
...you're implying that
we're not allowed to leave...

1287
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,487
...which would only be the case if we
were under arrest. Are we under arrest?

1288
01:10:56,783 --> 01:10:59,662
No. We just brought you in
for questioning.

1289
01:11:00,621 --> 01:11:03,363
Well, then, ipso facto...

1290
01:11:03,524 --> 01:11:06,868
...you don't have sufficient evidence...

1291
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:09,837
...constituting probable cause
for an arrest warrant.

1292
01:11:09,997 --> 01:11:11,032
Not yet.

1293
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:15,704
Well, uh, then, pursuant to
the Fourth Amendment...

1294
01:11:16,671 --> 01:11:20,140
...I believe we are free to go.
Are we not?

1295
01:11:20,774 --> 01:11:22,220
Yeah, technically. Yeah.

1296
01:11:23,243 --> 01:11:25,224
Technically is good enough for me.

1297
01:11:25,378 --> 01:11:28,222
Gentlemen, ahem, we are free men.

1298
01:11:28,682 --> 01:11:30,185
Let's go.

1299
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:32,456
We gotta get back to your car.
Keep moving.

1300
01:11:32,619 --> 01:11:35,100
We get a cab? Take the train?
What do you wanna do?

1301
01:11:35,256 --> 01:11:38,930
- You ever been on a subway in this town?
- Pretty great. Where'd that come from?

1302
01:11:39,092 --> 01:11:41,868
<i>Law & Order</i>, okay? You can
learn stuff watching <i>Law & Order</i>.

1303
01:11:42,029 --> 01:11:43,872
- We showed them, huh?
- We did show them.

1304
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:45,567
You were about to turn us in.

1305
01:11:45,733 --> 01:11:49,875
There was a few conversations about ratting
each other out, but it was gonna be fine.

1306
01:11:50,037 --> 01:11:51,310
Hold on.

1307
01:11:51,471 --> 01:11:54,282
That's for you, hotshot.
Speeding and running a red light.

1308
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:57,280
You boys don't get
too comfortable out there.

1309
01:11:57,444 --> 01:12:02,554
Our forensics team is sweeping the Pellit
house right now for DNA and fingerprints.

1310
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:05,761
And I'll tell you something.
They don't miss shit.

1311
01:12:10,423 --> 01:12:12,494
In the butt you go, go, go.

1312
01:12:14,228 --> 01:12:16,605
Why would you put his whole bathroom
in your ass?!

1313
01:12:16,764 --> 01:12:20,769
- I didn't I know I had DNA in my butt.
- Lying! You know there's DNA in your butt.

1314
01:12:20,935 --> 01:12:23,414
You just like shoving shit in your ass,
you fucking pervert!

1315
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:25,380
We are lawyering up, man. That's it.

1316
01:12:25,539 --> 01:12:29,511
I don't have money for a lawyer. I bought
a very expensive ring I can't afford...

1317
01:12:29,676 --> 01:12:32,623
...then I gave the rest of my motherfucking
money to Motherfucker Jones.

1318
01:12:32,779 --> 01:12:34,384
That's who we should talk to.

1319
01:12:34,548 --> 01:12:38,554
- He's covered us this far, right? Five grand?
- Five thousand. Forty, with the briefcase.

1320
01:12:38,752 --> 01:12:41,029
- Shut up about that!
- Shut up about the briefcase.

1321
01:12:43,823 --> 01:12:46,235
Excuse me. Excuse me. Da-da-da.

1322
01:12:46,394 --> 01:12:49,898
- Hello, Motherfucker.
- Hey, look who's back. Look who's back.

1323
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:52,908
Whatever happened to
that, uh, <i>Strangers on a Train</i> shit?

1324
01:12:53,067 --> 01:12:54,739
Didn't work out. We need your help.

1325
01:12:54,902 --> 01:12:57,746
One of our intended victims
killed the other intended victim.

1326
01:12:57,904 --> 01:12:59,509
- Shut the fuck up.
- It's gone bad.

1327
01:12:59,673 --> 01:13:01,551
You guys are some fucking evil geniuses.

1328
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:05,179
Thank you, but we had nothing to do
with it. We don't know why it happened.

1329
01:13:05,345 --> 01:13:06,881
The cops bring us in as suspects.

1330
01:13:07,047 --> 01:13:10,756
Kurt's DNA's all over the apartment because
he shoved a toothbrush up his ass.

1331
01:13:10,917 --> 01:13:13,454
- That's not the point.
-I'm giving him the whole story.

1332
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:15,760
I got you. First thing first,
we gotta handle business.

1333
01:13:15,922 --> 01:13:17,493
Mm-hm.

1334
01:13:17,992 --> 01:13:20,734
- I need $5000.
- There's gonna be no more money.

1335
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,498
- Two thousand?
- Absolutely not.

1336
01:13:22,662 --> 01:13:25,769
No way, Motherfucker. No.

1337
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:28,613
All right, look, pay for my drinks.

1338
01:13:28,769 --> 01:13:30,305
- Pay for his drink.
- I'll do that.

1339
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:31,972
Not a very good negotiator.

1340
01:13:32,139 --> 01:13:35,244
The guy that killed the other guy,
are the cops after him?

1341
01:13:35,408 --> 01:13:37,252
No, no, they don't suspect him.

1342
01:13:37,411 --> 01:13:39,356
Then this is what you need to do:

1343
01:13:39,613 --> 01:13:44,029
Get him to confess to the murder
while you're wearing a wire.

1344
01:13:44,185 --> 01:13:45,858
A wire? We can do that. That's easy.

1345
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:49,194
That how they got you
when you murdered somebody?

1346
01:13:53,394 --> 01:13:55,465
- I ain't never murder nobody.
- I'm sorry?

1347
01:13:55,729 --> 01:13:57,573
I never murdered anybody.

1348
01:13:57,731 --> 01:14:00,712
Wait, no. You said you did a dime
for some pretty nasty shit.

1349
01:14:00,868 --> 01:14:04,110
It was some nasty shit,
but does that mean I murdered somebody?

1350
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:07,012
- You implied it.
- You didn't murder someone, what'd you do?

1351
01:14:08,341 --> 01:14:10,447
All right, listen, get in here.

1352
01:14:13,247 --> 01:14:15,853
You guys ever see the movie
<i>Snow Falling on Cedars</i>?

1353
01:14:16,016 --> 01:14:17,051
No.

1354
01:14:17,217 --> 01:14:18,890
- Never seen that.
- I love that movie.

1355
01:14:19,052 --> 01:14:22,829
What happened was is that I took a video
camera into the movie and I bootleg it.

1356
01:14:22,989 --> 01:14:25,470
They was waiting right outside the exit.
They got me.

1357
01:14:25,626 --> 01:14:27,662
- You did 10 years for video piracy?
- Yeah.

1358
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:30,536
- They take that shit so serious, man.
- Not that seriously.

1359
01:14:30,698 --> 01:14:32,301
We've been taking murder advice...

1360
01:14:32,466 --> 01:14:35,640
...from some guy whose biggest crime
is taping an Ethan Hawke movie.

1361
01:14:35,802 --> 01:14:38,248
- So you do know the movie.
- I know who's in it.

1362
01:14:38,405 --> 01:14:42,319
Everyone knows the movie. That's not
the point. You tricked us, Motherfuck--

1363
01:14:42,475 --> 01:14:47,083
Hang on a second, something doesn't
stack up quite right with this, all right?

1364
01:14:47,247 --> 01:14:51,525
So you just call yourself a video pirate,
right? Pirating the high seas of videocy?

1365
01:14:51,685 --> 01:14:54,189
Why do you carry a gun on you,
Mr. Video Pirate?

1366
01:14:54,354 --> 01:14:55,856
- A gun?
- Yeah.

1367
01:14:56,023 --> 01:14:58,162
- I don't wanna see it.
- It's my cell phone.

1368
01:14:59,225 --> 01:15:02,332
-It's a Sidekick. I'm gonna be in the car.
- Oh, shit.

1369
01:15:02,496 --> 01:15:06,603
You grab at it like a gun and you confuse
people. Goddamn it, I feel like a moron.

1370
01:15:06,766 --> 01:15:08,439
- Let's go.
- You are a moron.

1371
01:15:08,836 --> 01:15:13,444
Look, you don't go into a bar and
hand a guy $5000 just because he black.

1372
01:15:13,606 --> 01:15:15,814
- It was never a black-white thing.
-No, come on.

1373
01:15:15,975 --> 01:15:17,956
Let's go. Come on. Dale.

1374
01:15:18,112 --> 01:15:20,113
Y'all motherfuckers crazy.

1375
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:32,231
Okay.

1376
01:15:32,393 --> 01:15:33,564
Looks pretty quiet, yeah?

1377
01:15:33,728 --> 01:15:38,039
Yeah, it does. Okay, tape recorder's ready
to roll, I got some fresh batteries in here.

1378
01:15:38,198 --> 01:15:42,146
It was a pretty big investment so I should
be the one who does the tape-recording.

1379
01:15:42,302 --> 01:15:44,510
- No way. No, I'll do it.
- You're gonna do it?

1380
01:15:44,671 --> 01:15:46,708
You'll have to duct-tape that
to your chest.

1381
01:15:46,873 --> 01:15:49,286
I can't tape this to my chest.
I have hair on chest.

1382
01:15:49,443 --> 01:15:52,322
Just put it in your pocket.
Not gonna tape it to his chest.

1383
01:15:52,947 --> 01:15:57,157
So, what do we do? Wait for him to come
home, we grab a office chair or something?

1384
01:15:57,318 --> 01:16:00,822
One of us gets in the chair, spins around
and dramatically confronts him.

1385
01:16:00,988 --> 01:16:02,831
- I'm in the chair.
- Nick's in the chair.

1386
01:16:02,989 --> 01:16:04,867
- Why are you in the chair?
- He's my boss.

1387
01:16:05,024 --> 01:16:08,494
Maybe we should get three chairs
and all spin around at the same time.

1388
01:16:08,662 --> 01:16:09,765
Confront him like that.

1389
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:12,409
That's not intimidating,
that's like a musical number.

1390
01:16:14,135 --> 01:16:15,273
Watch out for the cat.

1391
01:16:15,435 --> 01:16:16,641
Surprise!

1392
01:16:18,972 --> 01:16:21,578
Okay. It's a false alarm.
Just mingle, mingle, mingle.

1393
01:16:21,742 --> 01:16:22,981
Hi. Who are you?

1394
01:16:23,144 --> 01:16:24,987
Come inside. Close that door. Hurry.

1395
01:16:25,145 --> 01:16:27,023
Um, okay. Now, wait a minute.

1396
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:30,492
You're the young man who helped Dave
out on the street the other night.

1397
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:32,961
- That's him.
- Yeah, that's who I am.

1398
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:37,091
- How is he?
- He is great, thanks to you. Thank you.

1399
01:16:37,658 --> 01:16:39,864
- Did I invite you?
- You did and you didn't.

1400
01:16:40,027 --> 01:16:41,869
I work with your husband. We're late.

1401
01:16:42,029 --> 01:16:44,134
-These are my plus-twos.
- He's in the garage.

1402
01:16:44,297 --> 01:16:46,335
Oh, we should hide.
Everybody, come on in.

1403
01:16:47,368 --> 01:16:51,315
- Someone get the lights.
-Get down, get down, get down.

1404
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:55,984
I'm Kurt, by the way. I didn't
get a chance to introduce myself at the door.

1405
01:16:56,143 --> 01:16:59,283
- Oh, hey, Rhonda. Hi. Hi.
- Hi, Rhonda. Very nice to meet you.

1406
01:16:59,479 --> 01:17:02,016
Nick didn't tell me
his boss was married to a model.

1407
01:17:02,182 --> 01:17:04,322
Ha, ha. Yeah, not a model.

1408
01:17:05,685 --> 01:17:07,393
When did you quit?

1409
01:17:11,926 --> 01:17:13,927
Surprise!

1410
01:17:14,094 --> 01:17:16,404
Goddamn it! God, I hate that!

1411
01:17:16,564 --> 01:17:17,770
We got you, huh, honey?

1412
01:17:18,631 --> 01:17:20,942
- So you were surprised?
- Yeah.

1413
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,375
Look, sweetie, everybody's here.

1414
01:17:23,837 --> 01:17:25,317
I'm gonna put my stuff down.

1415
01:17:25,471 --> 01:17:28,213
She knows I hate surprises.

1416
01:17:28,542 --> 01:17:32,114
I think we got him. Ha, ha.
We got him good.

1417
01:17:33,314 --> 01:17:34,917
Okay.

1418
01:17:35,082 --> 01:17:37,493
He's gone off on his own.
This is our chance.

1419
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:39,391
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, very ready.

1420
01:17:39,552 --> 01:17:41,362
- Stay close, okay?
- Mm-hm.

1421
01:17:41,721 --> 01:17:44,167
Let's do it. Let's do it.

1422
01:17:45,859 --> 01:17:47,338
Harken.

1423
01:17:48,529 --> 01:17:50,304
I cannot believe my wife invited you.

1424
01:17:50,564 --> 01:17:53,373
What are you doing here?
Come to stab me a few more times?

1425
01:17:53,533 --> 01:17:56,070
- We know what you did.
- Well, what does that mean?

1426
01:17:56,237 --> 01:17:58,341
We were there. We saw you kill him.

1427
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:00,650
Really?

1428
01:18:01,475 --> 01:18:03,954
So, what is this, then?
Your little shakedown?

1429
01:18:05,045 --> 01:18:07,854
You think that you can blackmail me...

1430
01:18:08,448 --> 01:18:11,725
...because you saw me
kill my wife's lover?

1431
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,091
Say his name!

1432
01:18:16,023 --> 01:18:17,502
What?

1433
01:18:18,192 --> 01:18:20,399
The man you killed, you say his name.

1434
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,804
Pellit? Trust me, Pellit's name
means nothing anymore.

1435
01:18:23,963 --> 01:18:26,409
There it is. Thank you. Let's do it, guys.

1436
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:29,046
- Yeah, that's right.
-Hang on. Where the fuck is Kurt?

1437
01:18:29,203 --> 01:18:30,806
I killed Pellit.

1438
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:32,814
Hold that thought,
I'm missing my friend Kurt.

1439
01:18:32,972 --> 01:18:37,546
I walked right up to his door, I put
a gun in his chest and I shot him.

1440
01:18:37,711 --> 01:18:40,953
Then you know what? You know
what I did after that? I shot him again.

1441
01:18:41,114 --> 01:18:43,095
And let me tell you something.

1442
01:18:43,716 --> 01:18:45,594
I liked it.

1443
01:18:46,453 --> 01:18:50,332
So if you think
that I'm some sort of pussy...

1444
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:55,064
...who won't do exactly the same thing
to a couple of lame-assed blackmailers...

1445
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:56,367
...think again.

1446
01:18:56,529 --> 01:18:59,636
Know who thinks you're a pussy?
My friend Kurt. Let me grab him.

1447
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,244
You are pathetic, Hendricks.

1448
01:19:02,536 --> 01:19:08,612
You walk into my house on
my goddamn birthday and pull this shit.

1449
01:19:10,243 --> 01:19:11,814
Well, let me tell you something.

1450
01:19:13,247 --> 01:19:15,090
You're dead.

1451
01:19:15,716 --> 01:19:18,219
You and you.

1452
01:19:18,385 --> 01:19:19,728
- And...?
- Kurt.

1453
01:19:19,886 --> 01:19:22,527
Kurt. Dead men.

1454
01:19:23,256 --> 01:19:25,863
I didn't know it was your birthday.
What's he doing?

1455
01:19:26,025 --> 01:19:28,666
- What do you got?
- Getting my gun. Only take a second.

1456
01:19:28,828 --> 01:19:30,136
- I'll get the car.
- I'll go.

1457
01:19:30,296 --> 01:19:34,336
We had him, we had the whole goddamn
thing. What the fuck happened to Kurt?

1458
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,773
- Hey!
-There you are.

1459
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,970
Where were you?

1460
01:19:37,136 --> 01:19:39,548
My, uh, stomach was bothering me.
Had to use the bathroom.

1461
01:19:39,707 --> 01:19:41,983
He confessed everything,
now he's getting his gun.

1462
01:19:42,141 --> 01:19:43,621
- Kurt, what happened there?
-Oh, uh...

1463
01:19:43,777 --> 01:19:45,779
...she was giving me a tour
of the mouth-- House.

1464
01:19:46,212 --> 01:19:49,056
- Ow! What are you--?
- Get in the car. Right now.

1465
01:19:49,216 --> 01:19:51,320
- Knock it off.
- Come on.

1466
01:19:55,088 --> 01:19:57,729
Look, I wasn't thinking, okay? I'm sorry.

1467
01:19:58,257 --> 01:20:01,501
She's just very hot. And I'm weak.
I'm a weak, weak man, okay?

1468
01:20:01,662 --> 01:20:02,800
I admit it.

1469
01:20:04,163 --> 01:20:06,144
-Back it up, back it up.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1470
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:07,801
- They found my DNA.
- Back it up.

1471
01:20:07,967 --> 01:20:12,382
Go backwards. Go backwards.
See? They found your poop brush.

1472
01:20:12,972 --> 01:20:16,386
- You are obsessed with your asshole!
- No, I'm not. It was a prank, Dale.

1473
01:20:16,542 --> 01:20:19,456
Shut it down. Let's start talking about
where we're gonna live.

1474
01:20:19,613 --> 01:20:22,560
- The current situation won't work.
- There'll be cops everywhere.

1475
01:20:22,716 --> 01:20:24,024
You talking about fleeing?

1476
01:20:24,184 --> 01:20:26,755
Damn right.
I'm talking about Canada or Mexico.

1477
01:20:27,087 --> 01:20:29,795
I can't live in Mexico.
I mean, I can't handle the food.

1478
01:20:29,957 --> 01:20:31,868
My digestion alone-- I'll probably die.

1479
01:20:32,025 --> 01:20:34,596
- You'd rather be in jail the rest of your life?
- Shut the fuck up.

1480
01:20:35,962 --> 01:20:38,136
I'm getting a call. I gotta get this.
Hello?

1481
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:39,770
Hello, lover.

1482
01:20:39,932 --> 01:20:42,675
Uh, look, Julia,
now's not a good time to talk.

1483
01:20:42,836 --> 01:20:44,907
-Hey, I'm not here.
- <i>That's okay.</i>

1484
01:20:45,072 --> 01:20:47,313
I actually meant to
call your home phone.

1485
01:20:47,474 --> 01:20:49,283
You know, tell Stacy about us.

1486
01:20:49,443 --> 01:20:52,617
-No, don't do that. Wait. Wait.
- We'll learn the metric system.

1487
01:20:52,779 --> 01:20:55,920
We gotta buy coats and sweaters
and learn hockey and all that shit.

1488
01:20:56,082 --> 01:20:58,359
No, I think I've waited long enough, Dale.

1489
01:20:58,519 --> 01:21:00,863
I'm sort of tired of you
toying with my emotions.

1490
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,431
<i>I'm not playing with you.</i>

1491
01:21:02,588 --> 01:21:06,229
I'm not toying with you. I'm gonna
take care of it. I'm gonna take care of it.

1492
01:21:06,393 --> 01:21:09,271
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you gonna do to me?

1493
01:21:09,595 --> 01:21:11,269
- I'm gonna have sex with you.
- What?

1494
01:21:11,431 --> 01:21:13,570
<i>I want you to give me details, you pussy.</i>

1495
01:21:13,734 --> 01:21:15,407
And please be explicit.

1496
01:21:15,569 --> 01:21:18,845
Details? I'm in a car with people.
Now is not a good time for details.

1497
01:21:19,073 --> 01:21:22,417
-I don't care if it's not a great time.
- <i>Okay, fine.</i>

1498
01:21:22,576 --> 01:21:24,613
I'm gonna make you feel good.
You know?

1499
01:21:24,778 --> 01:21:27,257
With my fingers and my tongue
and whatnot.

1500
01:21:27,413 --> 01:21:29,324
I know you can do better than that.

1501
01:21:29,483 --> 01:21:32,122
All right, I'm gonna put my penis
in your pussy, Julia.

1502
01:21:32,286 --> 01:21:34,595
Oh, boy, that's gonna get me done.

1503
01:21:36,489 --> 01:21:37,900
What the fuck was that?

1504
01:21:40,394 --> 01:21:42,930
- What the fuck?
- That's Harken. Lose him.

1505
01:21:44,163 --> 01:21:46,166
- Oh, my God!
- Get out of here.

1506
01:21:48,402 --> 01:21:50,109
Look, careful.

1507
01:21:52,605 --> 01:21:55,951
Hey, are you gonna slap me in the face
with your cock, Dale?

1508
01:21:56,109 --> 01:21:58,420
Yes, I'll slap you in the face
with my cock!

1509
01:21:58,578 --> 01:22:01,855
- This guy's fucking crazy.
- Slap you all over your face with my cock!

1510
01:22:02,315 --> 01:22:04,353
- Don't get in a wreck.
- It's go time.

1511
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,158
Okay. More, Dale.

1512
01:22:08,322 --> 01:22:09,858
I will go up and down on you...

1513
01:22:10,023 --> 01:22:12,935
...<i>and I'll rub my naked butt</i>
<i>against your naked butt</i>...

1514
01:22:13,092 --> 01:22:14,697
...until it's raw and red...

1515
01:22:14,862 --> 01:22:16,899
...and we're both really chafed up
real bad.

1516
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:26,349
Not good. Get us out of here!
Get us out of here!

1517
01:22:26,506 --> 01:22:27,542
I got it, I got it.

1518
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:31,614
- Come on.
- I'll spit on your arms and stuff.

1519
01:22:31,778 --> 01:22:33,519
-What else?
- <i>And then I'm gonna</i>...

1520
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,591
...jam my skull
into the crack of your ass!

1521
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:39,887
Yeah, baby. In the crack of your ass.

1522
01:22:40,052 --> 01:22:43,398
And I'll dance on your boobies,
and I'll jump up and down on your butt.

1523
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:49,132
Ah. I'll see you Friday, dirty bird.

1524
01:22:49,296 --> 01:22:50,639
Good. Friday. See you Friday.

1525
01:22:50,796 --> 01:22:52,798
Nice job fucking the crazy
out of her, Kurt!

1526
01:22:52,966 --> 01:22:55,310
Maybe I should have been
dancing on her boobs, huh?

1527
01:22:55,469 --> 01:22:56,538
Maybe you should have.

1528
01:22:56,703 --> 01:22:58,444
That was very good driving, by the way.

1529
01:22:58,604 --> 01:22:59,675
Thank you very much.

1530
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,787
- <i>Good evening, Mr. Buckman.</i>
-Yeah, hey, Gregory. How are you?

1531
01:23:02,943 --> 01:23:05,389
<i>Our onboard sensors</i>
<i>report you've had a collision.</i>

1532
01:23:05,546 --> 01:23:07,685
That's because
we have a crazy man that hit us.

1533
01:23:07,847 --> 01:23:10,726
<i>I will alert the authorities</i>
<i>and direct them to your location.</i>

1534
01:23:10,884 --> 01:23:12,988
Don't call the cops.
They're already after us.

1535
01:23:13,153 --> 01:23:17,158
No, Gregory, they think we murdered
someone, all right? Do not call the cops.

1536
01:23:19,059 --> 01:23:20,765
What's going on?
Why you slowing down, Kurt?

1537
01:23:20,927 --> 01:23:23,908
Whoa. Oh, no, no, no. I didn't do that.
No, the engine died.

1538
01:23:24,064 --> 01:23:26,442
- <i>I remotely disabled your engine.</i>
-What?

1539
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,341
<i>It is standard Nav Guide protocol...</i>

1540
01:23:28,502 --> 01:23:30,412
...<i>whenever a driver</i>
<i>has committed a crime.</i>

1541
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:33,176
I pay 19 bucks a month
for this fucking service.

1542
01:23:33,372 --> 01:23:36,286
<i>Remain with your vehicle.</i>
<i>The police will be arriving shortly.</i>

1543
01:23:36,443 --> 01:23:39,219
Gregory, I thought you were
our fucking friend, man!

1544
01:23:54,661 --> 01:23:57,140
Get out of the car, all of you.
Come on. Come on.

1545
01:24:00,033 --> 01:24:03,104
-Remember I saved your life that one time?
- Shut up.

1546
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:07,350
Just take it easy with that--
-Shut up.

1547
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:09,180
I got six bullets in this gun.

1548
01:24:09,342 --> 01:24:12,813
Which means I can shoot all of you
twice, just like that bastard Pellit...

1549
01:24:12,979 --> 01:24:14,981
...if I really wanted to,
but I'm not gonna.

1550
01:24:15,148 --> 01:24:17,627
You're not gonna shoot us twice
or not gonna shoot us?

1551
01:24:17,783 --> 01:24:18,956
Shut up.

1552
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:23,865
I got a better idea. I'm gonna tell
the cops that you killed Pellit.

1553
01:24:24,024 --> 01:24:27,664
And when I found out,
you tried to kill me to shut me up.

1554
01:24:27,828 --> 01:24:29,329
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

1555
01:24:29,496 --> 01:24:33,341
Because I don't see one shred
of evidence that proves that I shot Pellit.

1556
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:36,002
And besides, I'm the guy
with the bullet in his leg.

1557
01:24:36,168 --> 01:24:37,443
What?

1558
01:24:39,605 --> 01:24:41,448
God, that hurts so much.

1559
01:24:41,608 --> 01:24:43,382
Son of a bitch.

1560
01:24:43,542 --> 01:24:44,953
- Catch!
- No, don't ca--!

1561
01:24:45,112 --> 01:24:47,023
- Goddamn it, Dale.
- You see?

1562
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:50,684
You can't win a marathon without
putting some Band-Aids on your nipples.

1563
01:24:51,385 --> 01:24:53,956
- What does that mean?
- Watch this.

1564
01:24:59,792 --> 01:25:01,067
-Everybody freeze!
- Police!

1565
01:25:01,228 --> 01:25:03,435
Drop the gun! On your knees!

1566
01:25:03,596 --> 01:25:06,543
Thank God.
Officers, thank God you're here.

1567
01:25:06,699 --> 01:25:08,680
These guys, they shot me.

1568
01:25:08,835 --> 01:25:10,542
- That's not true!
- That's bullshit!

1569
01:25:10,703 --> 01:25:13,479
I found out they murdered someone.
They tried to shut me up.

1570
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,552
Please protect me from them.
I have a wife and a cat!

1571
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:19,087
All right, take it easy.
Call for an ambulance.

1572
01:25:19,412 --> 01:25:23,122
- Hey, what is this?
-It's nothing. It's just a tape recorder.

1573
01:25:23,283 --> 01:25:24,819
Oh, shit! It's a tape recorder!

1574
01:25:24,984 --> 01:25:28,056
-A tape recorder. Did you turn that off?
- No, it's been recording!

1575
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:30,599
- So listen to us, officer.
- Hands up!

1576
01:25:30,756 --> 01:25:33,795
Listen to us for one second.
He confessed to killing Pellit.

1577
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,268
He said he shot him twice...

1578
01:25:35,429 --> 01:25:38,671
...and he was gonna shoot us once
or twice. He was unclear about that.

1579
01:25:38,832 --> 01:25:41,073
- You are insane.
- Just play the tape.

1580
01:25:43,804 --> 01:25:46,341
<i>But all those people are just right outside.</i>

1581
01:25:46,506 --> 01:25:48,247
<i>Your balls are so smooth.</i>

1582
01:25:48,608 --> 01:25:50,144
Wait a minute. Is that my wife?

1583
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:52,220
No, no. Of course not, no.
Let's move past that.

1584
01:25:52,378 --> 01:25:55,052
--<i>jam my skull</i>
<i>into the crack of your ass!</i>

1585
01:25:55,215 --> 01:25:57,661
<i>I'll dance on your boobies,</i>
<i>and jump up and down on your butt.</i>

1586
01:25:57,818 --> 01:25:58,853
What the fuck is this?

1587
01:25:59,019 --> 01:26:02,363
Don't judge. I have a thing with my boss.
It's none of your business.

1588
01:26:02,521 --> 01:26:04,024
If you could get to the end...?

1589
01:26:07,761 --> 01:26:08,864
There's nothing on here.

1590
01:26:09,029 --> 01:26:10,439
- Shit!
- What happened?

1591
01:26:10,596 --> 01:26:12,405
Thing must have stopped
when we crashed.

1592
01:26:12,565 --> 01:26:14,238
Before this guy
supposedly confessed?

1593
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,938
I told you, these guys are liars.
They cannot be trusted.

1594
01:26:17,104 --> 01:26:18,912
They shot me in the leg, killed a guy.

1595
01:26:19,072 --> 01:26:21,574
- He shot himself.
- I don't need to hear anything else.

1596
01:26:23,777 --> 01:26:25,586
-Cuff them.
- Oh, my God.

1597
01:26:25,746 --> 01:26:28,521
- You don't need to cuff us.
- My God, we're going to jail.

1598
01:26:28,681 --> 01:26:30,319
We're going to jail. Unbelievable.

1599
01:26:30,484 --> 01:26:31,895
It hurts. It hurts so much.

1600
01:26:32,051 --> 01:26:33,860
<i>Excuse me? Officers?</i>

1601
01:26:34,054 --> 01:26:36,193
<i>I should mention</i>
<i>that it is Nav Guide policy...</i>

1602
01:26:36,355 --> 01:26:39,199
<i>...to record all conversations</i>
<i>for quality assurance.</i>

1603
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:41,668
- Who the hell's that?
- That's our Nav Guide rep.

1604
01:26:41,828 --> 01:26:43,398
-His name is Almonan.
- Hands up!

1605
01:26:43,563 --> 01:26:45,132
- Atmanad.
- Almondmond.

1606
01:26:45,297 --> 01:26:47,641
-Atmanad is what it was!
- <i>Atmanand.</i>

1607
01:26:47,801 --> 01:26:50,610
Atmand-- Gregory, uh, play what he said.

1608
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:53,411
-Play it just after the crash.
- <i>Very good, sir.</i>

1609
01:26:53,573 --> 01:26:56,280
You're not gonna listen to this.
This isn't evidence.

1610
01:26:56,443 --> 01:26:58,514
<i>I got six bullets in this gun.</i>

1611
01:26:58,677 --> 01:27:01,658
<i>Which means I can shoot all of you</i>
<i>twice, just like that bastard Pellit...</i>

1612
01:27:01,814 --> 01:27:04,261
<i>...if I really wanted to,</i>
<i>but I'm not gonna.</i>

1613
01:27:04,417 --> 01:27:05,896
- That's it.
- So it was you.

1614
01:27:08,421 --> 01:27:11,835
That is not proof. That's just a car.
You're not gonna listen to a car.

1615
01:27:11,992 --> 01:27:14,563
Looks like I'm getting that promotion
after all. Yeah.

1616
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:16,962
To answer your question,
that was your wife.

1617
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:19,269
- You fucked my wife?
- I fucked your wife.

1618
01:27:19,432 --> 01:27:20,467
Nobody fucks my wife!

1619
01:27:23,569 --> 01:27:24,877
Ah.

1620
01:27:26,038 --> 01:27:27,484
How you like them nipples?

1621
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,279
Did you just do the catchphrase?

1622
01:27:29,443 --> 01:27:31,649
-<i>Good Will Hunting.</i>
- <i>Good Will Hunting.</i>

1623
01:27:31,811 --> 01:27:33,449
- That's so great.
- Caught it, yeah.

1624
01:27:33,613 --> 01:27:36,752
<i>Good Will Hunting</i> rip. Instead of
saying "apples" he said "nipples."

1625
01:27:36,917 --> 01:27:38,988
- Felt like a moment.
- And happy birthday.

1626
01:27:39,152 --> 01:27:41,564
<i>So in the end,</i>
<i>we didn't wind up going to jail.</i>

1627
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,327
<i>Actually, we did later that night</i>
<i>when they booked us.</i>

1628
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:46,528
<i>But since we led the cops to Harken...</i>

1629
01:27:46,693 --> 01:27:49,572
<i>...they ultimately agreed</i>
<i>to let our other offenses slide.</i>

1630
01:27:49,729 --> 01:27:51,367
<i>Strangely enough, lucky for Kurt...</i>

1631
01:27:51,832 --> 01:27:55,541
<i>...there's no laws on the books against</i>
<i>putting people's toiletries up your ass.</i>

1632
01:27:55,702 --> 01:27:57,806
<i>Anyway,</i>
<i>with Harken in his new position...</i>

1633
01:27:57,970 --> 01:28:03,250
<i>...on all fours in prison for 25 to life,</i>
<i>Comnidyne made me acting president.</i>

1634
01:28:03,944 --> 01:28:07,618
<i>It's a great job, I got a solid raise</i>
<i>and I'm actually my own boss.</i>

1635
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:09,088
<i>Well, except for the CEO.</i>

1636
01:28:09,248 --> 01:28:12,957
- Morning.
- Oh, morning. You, uh, must be Nick.

1637
01:28:13,118 --> 01:28:15,895
- I am.
- Well, it's great to finally meet you.

1638
01:28:16,055 --> 01:28:19,037
- You too, Mr. Sherman.
- Please. Lou.

1639
01:28:19,725 --> 01:28:21,636
Okay. Lou.

1640
01:28:21,795 --> 01:28:24,900
I appreciate the opportunity
you've given me. I won't let you down.

1641
01:28:25,231 --> 01:28:26,734
Yeah, I'm sure you won't, son.

1642
01:28:26,899 --> 01:28:29,573
<i>From what I hear, people say</i>
<i>he's the nicest guy in the world.</i>

1643
01:28:30,936 --> 01:28:32,847
Mr. Sherman,
I'm sorry your coffee was cold.

1644
01:28:33,006 --> 01:28:34,041
Uh, Lou?

1645
01:28:34,207 --> 01:28:35,447
<i>Most people.</i>

1646
01:28:35,609 --> 01:28:38,590
Mr. Sherman, I'm hungry!

1647
01:28:38,744 --> 01:28:40,690
Can I come out now, please?

1648
01:28:40,846 --> 01:28:43,225
- You hear that?
- No.

1649
01:28:43,382 --> 01:28:45,488
Sounds like there's someone
in your trunk.

1650
01:28:45,685 --> 01:28:50,064
Why don't we let this
be, uh, our little secret?

1651
01:28:50,222 --> 01:28:51,634
I need a shower.

1652
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:54,067
<i>Yeah. Turns out my new boss...</i>

1653
01:28:54,226 --> 01:28:56,434
<i>...is a twisted old fuck.</i>

1654
01:28:57,730 --> 01:29:01,610
<i>Meanwhile, the Pellit family put the most</i>
<i>senior person in charge of the company...</i>

1655
01:29:01,768 --> 01:29:04,771
<i>...which wasn't Kurt.</i>
<i>But he was okay with that.</i>

1656
01:29:04,938 --> 01:29:08,851
<i>Because he realized that when you're</i>
<i>the boss, sometimes people want you dead.</i>

1657
01:29:09,009 --> 01:29:12,387
- Hey, Kurt. Come in.
- Margie, I wanted to congratulate you.

1658
01:29:12,546 --> 01:29:13,581
Thank you.

1659
01:29:13,747 --> 01:29:17,524
If there's anything I can do to help out
before the baby gets here, let me know.

1660
01:29:17,684 --> 01:29:19,856
- What baby?
- Your baby.

1661
01:29:20,921 --> 01:29:23,925
- I'm not pregnant.
- So I'm just touching you?

1662
01:29:25,425 --> 01:29:26,563
Ay.

1663
01:29:26,926 --> 01:29:28,497
Julia.

1664
01:29:29,029 --> 01:29:33,478
I was thinking perhaps
we could drill the patient first.

1665
01:29:33,632 --> 01:29:34,667
<i>And Dale?</i>

1666
01:29:35,034 --> 01:29:38,608
<i>Ultimately, he decided his only choice</i>
<i>was to screw Julia after all.</i>

1667
01:29:38,771 --> 01:29:42,777
You just continue to surprise me...

1668
01:29:42,943 --> 01:29:45,115
...you dirty, dirty little man.

1669
01:29:45,545 --> 01:29:47,490
Just you wait.

1670
01:29:49,114 --> 01:29:50,719
You like that, Dale?

1671
01:29:50,884 --> 01:29:52,488
- You like that, Dale?
- Oh, my God, yeah.

1672
01:29:52,652 --> 01:29:54,494
Oh.

1673
01:29:55,689 --> 01:29:59,636
Oh, gosh, do I wish
I could have sex with Julia.

1674
01:30:02,494 --> 01:30:03,734
What?

1675
01:30:03,896 --> 01:30:06,672
I'm so sorry, but I couldn't keep it
together! It's amazing!

1676
01:30:06,832 --> 01:30:09,006
- She was talking to your penis!
- Who are you?

1677
01:30:09,168 --> 01:30:12,912
Julia, this is my good friend,
Kenny Sommerfeld.

1678
01:30:13,073 --> 01:30:14,746
Most Likely to Succeed.

1679
01:30:14,908 --> 01:30:16,979
- Give me some of that.
- Don't you touch me.

1680
01:30:17,143 --> 01:30:19,850
Now, Kenny here, he'll do
just about anything for 50 bucks.

1681
01:30:20,012 --> 01:30:22,083
- Yeah, it's true.
- Yeah, and it's not pretty.

1682
01:30:22,247 --> 01:30:24,989
But that's why I asked him
to help me frame you.

1683
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:29,292
Really? Is this all you've got?
Your word against mine?

1684
01:30:29,456 --> 01:30:31,025
Don't forget about that guy.

1685
01:30:31,190 --> 01:30:34,764
Say hi to my cameraman.
He's filmed a lot of Hollywood hits.

1686
01:30:34,927 --> 01:30:36,668
You are a sick little bastard.

1687
01:30:36,829 --> 01:30:38,639
You are a sick little bastard.

1688
01:30:38,797 --> 01:30:40,243
Shut the fuck up for a second.

1689
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:43,381
Julia, shut the fuck up for a second,
all right?

1690
01:30:43,536 --> 01:30:45,481
Now, here's what's gonna happen, okay?

1691
01:30:45,639 --> 01:30:50,917
I'm going to take a very nice, very expensive
two-week vacation with my fiancée.

1692
01:30:51,077 --> 01:30:54,216
Let's call it a honeymoon, all right?
And you are gonna pay for it.

1693
01:30:54,413 --> 01:30:59,453
Then I'm going to return
to a rape-free workplace, all right?

1694
01:30:59,618 --> 01:31:04,568
Because if you so much as look
at my sexy little ass, Julia...

1695
01:31:04,724 --> 01:31:07,466
...I will have yours locked the fuck up...

1696
01:31:07,627 --> 01:31:13,542
...you crazy bitch whore!

1697
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,006
Ah, that felt good.

1698
01:31:24,911 --> 01:31:28,756
How's the hair? Is it good, is it great?
It's not as bad as his, is it?

1699
01:31:30,382 --> 01:31:35,798
I had no idea that you called
your grandmother "Gam Gam."

1700
01:31:38,891 --> 01:31:40,462
Calm down!

1701
01:31:41,895 --> 01:31:43,033
Oh!

1702
01:31:46,198 --> 01:31:49,408
Holy shit. He went out the door.

1703
01:31:49,735 --> 01:31:52,944
This place is awful. It's like
The Sharper Image took a shit in here.

1704
01:31:53,105 --> 01:31:54,311
Five. Forty, with the briefcase.

1705
01:31:54,474 --> 01:31:57,079
Oh, shut up about the briefcase.

1706
01:31:57,243 --> 01:32:01,055
Gonna put that "briefcabe" up my ass.

1707
01:32:02,414 --> 01:32:04,292
I'm gonna put that briefcase up my ass!

1708
01:32:11,757 --> 01:32:12,792
<i>A dancin' girl</i>

1709
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:14,904
- You're good? He's good.
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1710
01:32:15,261 --> 01:32:17,797
Or else little Stacy here's
gonna get a little peek...

1711
01:32:17,963 --> 01:32:21,377
...at my photo album.

1712
01:32:24,136 --> 01:32:26,743
One more. Let's fix this.

1713
01:32:28,608 --> 01:32:31,315
Have you ever in your life
seen this much co--?

1714
01:32:34,046 --> 01:32:36,823
<i>Pee, pee, pee, pee on the--</i>

1715
01:32:38,283 --> 01:32:39,489
Let's--

1716
01:32:44,023 --> 01:32:46,594
Now I'm sneezing dust bunnies.
Is that diabetes?

1717
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,761
I'm a pharmacist, not a doctor.

1718
01:32:48,927 --> 01:32:50,668
Is that my brain?
Take my temperature.

1719
01:32:50,829 --> 01:32:52,274
Have you any, uh, roofies?

1720
01:32:52,431 --> 01:32:54,274
I want a lollipop.
Do you like karaoke?

1721
01:32:54,434 --> 01:32:57,210
Do you have MDMA?
I'll suck your d--

1722
01:33:02,509 --> 01:33:04,351
Shit happens.

1723
01:33:06,011 --> 01:33:10,893
What is your projected outside date
of completion, Motherfucker?

1724
01:33:19,692 --> 01:33:21,432
Give me that again.

1725
01:33:23,997 --> 01:33:26,306
-Oh, hi! Hi! Hello.
- Hi.

1726
01:33:26,466 --> 01:33:27,706
Come on, what are you--?

1727
01:33:29,502 --> 01:33:32,744
Wouldn't mind bending her over a barrel
and showing her the 50 states.

1728
01:33:32,905 --> 01:33:34,317
I don't know what that means.

1729
01:33:34,474 --> 01:33:36,453
- It's a phrase.
- I don't think so.

1730
01:33:36,609 --> 01:33:40,454
Yeah, it is. It certainly is.
Yeah, it definitely is.

1731
01:33:40,613 --> 01:33:42,889
- Really?
- Yeah, it's from a movie.

1732
01:33:43,048 --> 01:33:44,083
Uh-uh.

1733
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:45,922
It is now.

1734
01:33:46,219 --> 01:33:47,926
Beautiful.
