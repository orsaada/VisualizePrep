1
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,359
- Come here.
- What?

2
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,673
- Good morning, Mrs. Staples.
- Good morning, madam.

3
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,353
Late!
Late!

4
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,899
Thomas!

5
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,037
Oh, fuck!
Fuck!

6
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,043
Fuck!

7
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,183
- Fuck! Right, we take yours.
- It only goes 40 miles an hour.

8
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,779
What turn-off?

9
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,075
- Better not be the B359.
- It's the B359!

10
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,660
Fuck it!

11
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,166
Fuck!

12
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,172
Fuck.

13
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,185
Fuck.

14
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,822
Fuck.

15
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,323
Fuckity fuck.

16
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,788
Bugger.

17
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,462
- Look at you!
- Is it twisted?

18
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,216
Hello, Charles.

19
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,901
There's a greatness to your lateness.

20
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,737
It's not achieved without real suffering.

21
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,992
I am so, so sorry.

22
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,329
I'll be killing myself after the
service, if that's any consolation.

23
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,874
- Doesn't matter. Tom was standing by.
- Thanks, Tom. You're a saint.

24
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,710
Disastrous haircut.

25
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,759
- You haven't forgotten the rings?
- No.

26
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,863
Hate people being late!
Hate it!

27
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,459
Here we go.

28
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,109
Isn't she lovely?

29
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,404
Scarlett, you're blind.
She looks like a big meringue.

30
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,916
Dear friends, what a joy it is
to welcome you to our church...

31
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,670
...on this wonderful day
for Angus and Laura.

32
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:07,217
Before we start the service, let us
all join together in the first hymn.

33
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,365
Scarlett...

34
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,623
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God...

35
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,958
...and in the face
of this congregation...

36
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:26,338
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony...

37
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,173
...which is an honorable estate...

38
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,009
...instituted in the time
of man's innocency.

39
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,177
Back in a sec.

40
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,888
Therefore, if any man can show
any just cause or impediment...

41
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,307
...why they may not
be lawfully joined together...

42
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,936
...let him speak now
or for ever hold his peace.

43
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,814
Do you promise to love her,
comfort her...

44
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,026
...honor and keep her,
in sickness and in health...

45
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,322
...and, forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto her...

46
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,158
- ...for as long as ye both shall live?
- I do.

47
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,494
To love and to cherish...

48
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,539
- ...till death us do part.
- ...till death us do part.

49
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:05,835
- And thereto I pledge thee my troth.
- And thereto I pledge thee my troth.

50
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,922
Do you have the ring?

51
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:20,892
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.

52
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:27,023
With my body, I thee worship.

53
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,734
And with all my worldly goods
I do thee endow.

54
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,947
And with all my worldly goods
I thee endow.

55
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:44,416
"If I speak with the tongues of men
and of angels, but have not love...

56
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,544
...I am become as sounding brass,
or a clanging cymbal."

57
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,337
Good point.

58
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,523
- Great hat.
- Thanks. I bought it specially.

59
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,237
There.

60
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,830
Right... Get in position, please.

61
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,999
Thank you.
Smile.

62
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,294
Splendid, I thought.
What did you think?

63
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,172
I thought splendid.
What did you think?

64
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,465
Splendid, I thought.

65
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,093
Scarlotta, fabulous dress!

66
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,762
The ecclesiastical purple
and the pagan orange...

67
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,014
...symbolizing the symbiosis
in marriage...

68
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,016
...between the heathen
and Christian traditions?

69
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,434
That's right.

70
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,522
Lovely.
And again.

71
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,025
Any idea who the girl
in the black hat is?

72
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,027
Name's Carrie.

73
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,822
- She's pretty.
- American.

74
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,156
Interesting.

75
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,449
Slut.

76
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,576
Really?

77
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,955
Used to work at Vogue.
Lives in America now.

78
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,916
Only goes out with very glamorous people.

79
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,334
Quite out of your league.

80
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,963
Well, that's a relief.
Thanks.

81
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,967
- See you there.
- Off you go. Off you go.

82
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,096
Right!
Reception!

83
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,476
Bye!

84
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,819
Anyone else tread in a cowpat?

85
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,322
No, thought not.
See you in a mo.

86
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,992
Do you think I'd hate him as much
if he wasn't my brother?

87
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,623
Don't want to blow my chances
for romance by smelling of dung!

88
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,256
I never know what to say
in these wretched line-ups.

89
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:43,094
It's a cinch. Just give a big, warm hug
and say the bride looks... pregnant.

90
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:47,724
- Or go for "you must be very proud".
- Heaven preserve us.

91
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,518
- You must be very proud.
- Indeed.

92
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,104
- Hello.
- Hello.

93
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,355
Hello.

94
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,616
- Hi. We've met. It's Richard Maples.
- Oh, yes.

95
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,118
Bastard.

96
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,127
Hello, Bern.

97
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,629
Two, please.

98
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,881
- You have fun.
- Take care.

99
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,221
- Hello!
- Hi.

100
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,766
- Do you want one of these?
- Thank you.

101
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,310
Hello, Charles!

102
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:36,064
Hello, dear John.
How are you? How are you?

103
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,399
- Good. This is...
- Carrie.

104
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,110
- Delighted. I'm John.
- Hi, John.

105
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,825
- How's your gorgeous girlfriend?
- She's no longer my girlfriend.

106
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:50,495
Ah! I wouldn't get too gloomy about it.
Rumor has it she never stopped

107
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,664
booking Toby de Lisle
in case you didn't work out.

108
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,417
She is now my wife.

109
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,213
Excellent!
Excellent! Congratulations!

110
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,714
Excuse me.

111
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,677
Any kids or anything, John?

112
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:09,430
Do we hear the patter of tiny... feet?

113
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,350
No.

114
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,603
Well, there's plenty of time for that,
isn't there? No hurry.

115
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,073
Hi.
How are you?

116
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,801
- My name's Fiona.
- I'm Gerald.

117
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:51,222
- What do you do?
- I'm training to be a priest.

118
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,807
Good Lord.

119
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,728
- Do you do weddings?
- No. No, not yet.

120
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,355
I will, of course.
Jolly nerve-racking.

121
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,108
Yes, rather like the first time
one has sex.

122
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,487
Well, I suppose so.

123
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,991
Though rather less messy, of course,
and far less call for condoms.

124
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:39,187
- Who's that boy over there in the grey?
- His name's David.

125
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,606
Something of a dish, isn't he?

126
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,150
Well, I've always thought so.

127
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,528
- Why are they?
- The dish can't hear.

128
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,907
Oh, Gosh.

129
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,992
Yeah, silent...

130
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,911
...but deadly attractive.

131
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,122
Bang, bang, bang.
That's it.

132
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,042
Into the marquee, please.
Dinner is served.

133
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,757
- How do you do?
- Hello. Tom. Splendid to meet you.

134
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,175
Very exciting.

135
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,064
Hi.

136
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,900
My name's Scarlett.

137
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,820
Don't let me drink too much
'cause I'll get really flirty.

138
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,994
- How do you do? My name's Charles.
- Don't be ridiculous!

139
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:41,582
- Charles died 20 years ago.
- Must be a different Charles, I think.

140
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,835
Are you telling me
I don't know my own brother?

141
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,919
No, no.

142
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,647
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry
to drag you from your desserts.

143
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,943
There are just one or two little things
I feel I should say, as best man.

144
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:14,824
This is only the second time I've been
a best man. I hope I did OK that time.

145
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,285
The couple in question
are at least still talking to me.

146
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,791
Unfortunately, they're not
actually talking to each other.

147
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,544
The divorce came through
a couple of months ago.

148
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,591
But I'm assured it had
absolutely nothing to do with me.

149
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,636
Paula knew Piers
had slept with her sister

150
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,139
before I mentioned it in the speech.

151
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,519
The fact that he'd slept with her mother
came as a surprise...

152
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:48,983
...but, I think, was incidental
to the nightmare of recrimination...

153
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,402
...and, violence...

154
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,654
...that became their two-day marriage.

155
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,950
Anyway, enough of that!
My job today is to talk about Angus.

156
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,078
There are no skeletons in his cupboard.

157
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,415
Or so I thought!

158
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,376
I'll come on to that in a minute.
I would just like to say this.

159
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,591
I am...

160
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:18,471
...as ever, in bewildered awe...

161
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,765
...of anyone who makes
this kind of commitment...

162
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,017
...that Angus and Laura have made today.

163
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,354
I know I couldn't do it and...

164
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,524
...I think it's wonderful they can.

165
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,861
So, back to Angus and those sheep!

166
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,201
So, ladies and gentlemen,
if you'd raise your glasses.

167
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,537
The adorable couple.

168
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,582
The adorable couple.

169
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,543
The adorable couple.

170
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,523
I remember the first time
I saw Gareth dancing.

171
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,442
I feared lives would be lost!

172
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,698
She's a pretty girl...
the one you can't take your eyes off.

173
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,491
Is it love at first sight?

174
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,954
Good Lord, no!
It's the bloke she's dancing with.

175
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,124
I played rugby with him at school.
I'm wondering what position he played.

176
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,963
Though, let's say,
for the sake of argument...

177
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,467
...one did take a fancy
to someone at a wedding.

178
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,553
Do you think there really
are people who can say...

179
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,681
..."Hi, babe. My name's Charles.
This is your lucky night"?

180
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,518
Well, if there are, they're not English.

181
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,686
Quite.

182
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,107
Three weeks is about
my question-popping minimum.

183
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:40,404
You know I love you, Jean, don't you?
I love you. I love you.

184
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,033
And, Mike, I've never met you before...

185
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,327
...but I love you very much.
I really do.

186
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,997
Ignore her.
She's drunk.

187
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,002
At least I hope she is.
Otherwise, I'm in real trouble.

188
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,508
- How's it going, Lyds?
- Bloody awful.

189
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,052
Oh, dear!
What's the prob?

190
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,139
I was promised sex.
Everybody said it.

191
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:11,102
"You be a bridesmaid, you'll get sex.
You'll be fighting them off."

192
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:14,522
But not so much as a tongue in sight.

193
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:20,027
Well, I mean, if you fancy...
anything...

194
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:24,448
- ...I could always...
- Don't be ridiculous, Bernard.

195
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,451
- I'm not that desperate.
- No, right. Of course.

196
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,496
Fair enough.
It's a good point.

197
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,390
Bye!

198
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,145
Have a lovely, lovely time!
Bye!

199
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,262
Where are you staying tonight, Charles?

200
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,390
Scarlett and I are at some pub.

201
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,186
The Lucky Boat, something like that.
Aren't we all?

202
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,731
Ah, no.
Slight change of plan.

203
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:42,151
The others are coming back to my place.
Nansy's in residence.

204
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:45,571
Might knock us up a plate of eggs
and bacon over a late-night Scrabble.

205
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:49,867
- I wondered if you'd like to join.
- Oh, yeah! Thanks very much.

206
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,745
- Is there room for Scarlett?
- Absolutely.

207
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,955
137 rooms, actually.

208
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,460
Right.
Tommy, are you the richest man in England?

209
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,296
Oh, no, no!

210
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,801
I believe we're about... seventh.

211
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,344
The Queen, obviously...

212
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:12,181
...and, that Branson bloke's
doing terribly well.

213
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,103
Well, excellent news.
I'll go and tell Scarlett.

214
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,063
Yeah.

215
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:22,233
That's... unless you get lucky first.

216
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,908
Hi.

217
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,912
Hi. Hi.
I thought you'd gone.

218
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:39,041
No, not yet. I was just wondering
where you were staying tonight.

219
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,086
Well...

220
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,257
I was staying at some pub
called The Lucky...

221
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,221
- ...The Boat or something like that.
- Boatman.

222
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,847
Right. But now I'm going to stay
at some friends' house...

223
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,433
...with, some friends.

224
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,270
Well, I think "enormous castle"
is a more accurate description.

225
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,439
That's too bad,
because I'm at The Boatman.

226
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:08,571
Well, it was...
nice not quite meeting you.

227
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,408
- It was a great speech.
- Thanks.

228
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:24,044
- Well, I'm going now.
- No! No, no. Don't go. We can meet now.

229
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,339
- The evening's just getting going.
- We both know that's a big lie.

230
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,221
Fuck.

231
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,750
The castle beckons, Tom.
Are you sober?

232
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,543
Absolutely.
Orange juice all night.

233
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,298
Come on.

234
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,305
- Bye, everybody!
- All together now!

235
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,524
Bernard!

236
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,254
Stand by...

237
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,548
Tom, Tom, can you stop the car?

238
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,132
Stop the car!

239
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:58,305
Sorry. Sorry. I just think I might,
stay in that pub after all.

240
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,683
Why on earth...?

241
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,235
No, seriously.

242
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:15,239
I'm doing some research into pubs
with the word "boat" in the title.

243
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,866
- Oh, well. Please yourself.
- It's a silly thing.

244
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,666
Right.

245
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,671
Odd decision.

246
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,215
Hello.

247
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,052
- Hi.
- Hi.

248
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,138
In the end there wasn't
room for all of us.

249
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,598
You said it was a castle.

250
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,227
Yes, it is a castle.
It's, just a very, very small one.

251
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,856
Tiny, in fact.
Just one up, one down, which is rare.

252
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,816
Drink, sir?

253
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,653
Yeah. I'd like a glass of whisky, please.
Thanks.

254
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,572
- Do you want...?
- Yeah, sounds good.

255
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,991
- Another for the lady.
- Doubles, sir?

256
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,159
Thanks.

257
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,705
Ah! You here, too?
How are you?

258
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,251
- Hello. I'm fine.
- Haven't seen Carrie, have you?

259
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:55,089
- Who?
- Carrie. American girl. Lovely legs.

260
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,383
Wedding guest.
Nice smell.

261
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,636
- No. Sorry.
- Damn!

262
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,806
Blast!
I think I was in there.

263
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,228
If you do see her,
could you tell her I've gone to my room?

264
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,312
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,815
- Your whisky, sir.
- Thank you.

266
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,317
- And one for the...
- Road. Lovely.

267
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:19,071
I think I might have one of those.
Do you mind if I join you?

268
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:22,700
- No. It'd be lovely.
- Another glass of whisky and a cigar.

269
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:27,079
Hold on. Make that a bottle.
We might as well settle in?

270
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,039
Let's see if we can push on till dawn.

271
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,584
- Lovely wedding.
- Yes, yes.

272
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,879
I was at school with his brother Bufty.
Tremendous bloke.

273
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,841
He was head of my house.
Buggered me senseless.

274
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,052
Still, it taught me about life.

275
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,887
Where do you know him from?

276
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,558
- University.
- Splendid.

277
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,768
Splendid.
Yep.

278
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,397
I didn't go myself.
I couldn't see the point.

279
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:57,359
When you work in the money markets,
what use is Wordsworth, eh?

280
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:01,363
Excuse me, sir. Your wife says
could you come upstairs at once?

281
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,991
Room 12, in case you're so drunk
you can't remember.

282
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,243
- My wife?
- Yes, sir.

283
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,246
Oh, my wife!
My wife!

284
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,708
God! You are drunk if you can't
remember you've got a wife!

285
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,293
Yeah, yeah!

286
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,922
- Do you mind if I...
- No, no. Off you go. Best of luck.

287
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:23,469
Lucky bachelor, me. I'll have
another search for that Katie creature.

288
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,388
- Carrie.
- That's the one. Damn fine filly.

289
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,183
I think I'm in there.

290
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,576
- Hi.
- Hello.

291
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,288
- Sorry about that.
- He was hard to get rid of.

292
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,539
Yeah.

293
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,626
So...

294
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,302
Maybe we could just...
skulk around here for a bit...

295
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,138
...and then... go back down.

296
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,934
That's a thought.
I don't usually skulk...

297
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:15,229
...but I suppose I could skulk
if skulking were required.

298
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,565
Do you skulk regularly?

299
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:24,905
No. No, I don't normally think
of myself as a skulker, but...

300
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,288
Well, why don't you come in
and skulk for a while...

301
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,415
...and we'll see?

302
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:47,219
I noticed the bride and groom
didn't kiss in the church...

303
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,012
...which is kind of strange.

304
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,390
Where I come from, kissing is very big.

305
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:55,936
Is it? Well, I think you're right.
We are probably more reserved.

306
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,148
"You may kiss the bride" isn't
actually in the Book of Common Prayer.

307
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,652
I always worry I'll go too far
in the heat of the moment.

308
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,158
How far do you think too far would be?

309
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,535
I don't know.

310
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,289
Maybe...

311
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,209
...that would be all right.

312
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:24,131
- I think that would be fine.
- In fact, it might be a bit dismissive.

313
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,593
Maybe this...

314
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,138
...would be better.

315
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,977
Yeah, I think it would be dangerous
to take it any further.

316
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,063
I mean...

317
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,692
You know...

318
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,787
That might be taking it a little far.

319
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,712
What about this?

320
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,355
Do you think the vicar would think...

321
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,592
...things had slipped
a little out of his control?

322
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,262
I think he might. This kind of thing
is really better suited...

323
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:16,391
...to the honeymoon
than to the service itself.

324
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,186
Why do you think it's called a honeymoon?

325
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,606
I don't know.

326
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,526
I suppose it's... "honey"
'cause it's sweet as honey...

327
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,822
...and... "moon" because
it was the first time...

328
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:34,409
...a husband got to see
his wife's bottom.

329
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,785
What's happening?

330
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,331
I have to go.

331
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,960
- Where?
- America.

332
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,589
That is a tragedy.

333
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,592
Just before I go...

334
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,762
...when were you thinking of
announcing the engagement?

335
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,728
Sorry.
Whose engagement?

336
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,480
Ours.

337
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,734
I assumed since we slept together
and everything, we'd be getting married.

338
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,070
What did you think?

339
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,289
Gosh!
You know, that...

340
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,542
...takes a lot of thinking about,
that kind of thing.

341
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,421
Obviously, I'm...

342
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,008
You're joking.

343
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:20,057
God! For a moment there,
I thought I was in Fatal Attraction.

344
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:24,978
You were Glenn Close and I was
gonna find my pet rabbit on the stove.

345
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,564
No.

346
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,319
But I think we both missed
a great opportunity here.

347
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,285
Bye.

348
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,896
Oh, fuck!

349
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Fuck!

350
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:18,073
- Fuck! Fuckity fuck!
- Oh, fuck!

351
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,368
- Car or taxi?
- Taxi. We could never park.

352
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,212
Car seems a good idea.

353
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,382
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

354
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,895
- Hey...
- Leave it. No one will notice.

355
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,752
Well...

356
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,630
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic.

357
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,553
Yeah...
Who is it today?

358
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,185
One more, please.

359
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,296
They're ready.

360
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,728
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

361
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,147
- Amen.
- Amen.

362
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,358
Let us pray.

363
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:03,655
Father, you have made
the bond of marriage a holy mystery...

364
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,701
...a symbol of Christ's love
for his church.

365
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,955
Hear our prayers for Bernard and Lydia...

366
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:17,127
...through your Son,
Jesus Christ our Lord...

367
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:21,131
...who lives and reigns
with you and the Holy Goat...

368
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,049
Ghost.

369
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:27,053
One God, for ever and ever.

370
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,805
Amen.

371
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,308
It's his first time.
He's a family friend.

372
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:35,020
- Ah, excellent!
- Bernard and Lydia...

373
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:39,858
...I shall now ask if you freely
undertake the obligations of marriage.

374
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,694
Bernard, repeat after me.

375
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:47,490
- I do solemnly declare...
- I do solemnly declare...

376
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:53,788
...that I know not
of any lawful impediment...

377
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,665
...why I, Lydia...

378
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,668
...why I, Bernard...

379
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,755
Sorry.

380
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,007
...why I,

381
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:09,471
Bernard Godfrey Saint John Delaney...

382
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:15,477
...why I, Bernard Geoffrey
St.. John Delaney...

383
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,022
...may not be joined in matrimony

384
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,525
to Lydia John Hibbott.

385
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:27,238
...may not be joined in matrimony
to Lydia Jane Hibbott.

386
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,619
Lydia, repeat after me.

387
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,790
- I do solemnly declare...
- I do solemnly declare...

388
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:42,712
...that I know not
of any lawful impediment...

389
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:50,220
...why I, Lydia Jane Hibbott...

390
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,597
...may not be johned in matrimony...

391
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:56,601
...may not be joined in matrimony...

392
00:39:56,685 --> 00:40:02,482
...to Bernard Geoffrey Sidd...
Siddun... Delaney.

393
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:08,488
...to Bernard Geoffrey St. John Delaney.

394
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:19,374
I call upon those persons
here present to witness...

395
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,501
...that I, Bernard...

396
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,135
...Delaney...

397
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,014
...that I, Bernard Delaney...

398
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:41,062
...do take thee, Lydia Jane Hibbott...

399
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,981
...to be my awful wedded wife.

400
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,444
...to be my lawful wedded wife.

401
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,612
That's right.

402
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,323
May Almighty God bless you all.

403
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:56,286
The Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spigot... Spirit.

404
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,788
- Amen.
- Bravo!

405
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,187
Thanks.

406
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,897
- Coming, Bernie!
- Come here!

407
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,065
Sorry.

408
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,651
Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry.

409
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,903
That way?

410
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,156
Sorry.
Could you two... Sorry.

411
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,200
Sorry!

412
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,885
I've got a new theory about marriage.

413
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,763
Two people are in love,
they live together,

414
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,934
and one day they run out of conversation.

415
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,938
Totally. They can't think of a single
thing to say to each other.

416
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,273
That's it!
Panic!

417
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,108
Then suddenly,

418
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:13,613
it occurs to the chap
that there is a way out of the deadlock.

419
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:18,201
- Which is?
- He'll ask her to marry him.

420
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,370
Brilliant!
Brilliant!

421
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,498
They've got something to talk
about for the rest of their lives!

422
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,378
So it's just a way out of
an embarrassing pause in conversation.

423
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,381
The definitive icebreaker!

424
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:35,843
- Tom! How's the speech coming along?
- It's pretty good, I think.

425
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,930
Something for everyone.
Tears, laughter...

426
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,310
- Excellent!
- It's a very good theory, Gareth.

427
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,895
There is another argument, of course,

428
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,314
that it has something to do
with true love.

429
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:50,984
Well, there's a thought.

430
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:59,367
- Can I help you, sir?
- Can I have three brandies, please?

431
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,452
Hi.

432
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,330
Hello!

433
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,250
- How are you?
- Fine! Fine!

434
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,170
Sorry. I'm...
I'm overwhelmed to see you.

435
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:15,967
Look, don't go back to America.
Please.

436
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,261
- I'll be back in two secs, OK?
- OK.

437
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:21,848
Hi, Fi.

438
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:25,184
Those are yours.
See you in five hours.

439
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,936
- Something happened?
- It has.

440
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,314
This is a bloody great wedding!

441
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,154
Hi.

442
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:40,241
Well, you look perfect.
In fact, you probably are perfect.

443
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,328
- Well, how are you?
- I'm really well.

444
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,664
Charles, I'd like you
to meet Hamish, my fiancé.

445
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,795
Excellent!
Excellent.

446
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,882
How do you do, Hamish?
Delighted to meet you.

447
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,759
Charming surprise to find Carrie back.

448
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,345
Took a lot of persuading, I can tell you.

449
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,680
Darling, I told James
I was going to get you.

450
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,683
He'll think I've totally
lost control of you already.

451
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,144
I'll see you later.

452
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,780
How are you doing, Charles?

453
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,575
Not great, actually... suddenly.

454
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,747
I don't know...

455
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:34,003
I mean, what the hell's going on here?

456
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:38,049
Why am I always at weddings and
never actually getting married, Matt?

457
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,802
It's probably because
you're a bit scruffy.

458
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,224
Or it could also be
'cause you haven't met the right girl.

459
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,185
Ah, but you see, is that it?

460
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:52,939
Maybe I have met the right girls.
Maybe I meet the right girls all the time.

461
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,318
- Maybe it's me.
- Nonsense.

462
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,321
My lords, ladies and gentlemen...

463
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,281
...dinner is served.

464
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,452
Come on.
Odds on, you meet your wife at dinner.

465
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,455
Yes!

466
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,467
Oh, my God!

467
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,639
Charles?

468
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,816
- Hi.
- Hello. I'm Alistair.

469
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,900
Great.

470
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,611
- I believe you know Veronica.
- Yeah. Hi, Vee. Hi.

471
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,739
Nicki.

472
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,617
Great.

473
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,834
Tell me, are you married?

474
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,878
No.

475
00:45:56,962 --> 00:46:00,047
- Are you a lesbian?
- Good Lord!

476
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,426
Well, what made you say that?

477
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,012
It's one of the possibilities
for unmarried girls.

478
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:11,267
It is a bit more interesting than saying
"just never found the right chap", eh?

479
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:15,605
- Quite right. Why be dull?
- Thank you.

480
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:24,489
The truth is... I have met the right
person, only he's not in love with me.

481
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,033
And until I stop loving him,
no one else stands a chance.

482
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,244
- Bad luck!
- Yes, isn't it?

483
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,125
I was a lesbian once at school,
but only for 15 minutes.

484
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,794
I don't think it counts.

485
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,054
There are 400 different kinds of tea...

486
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,974
...and that's not including
all these so-called fruit teas.

487
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:55,895
I took Veronica out to India at
Christmas to look at the plantations.

488
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,023
- You and her went there once.
- That's right.

489
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:03,402
Charles was vile. He insisted on
cracking jokes all the time I was ill.

490
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,989
- Trying to cheer you up.
- Oh, you're that Veronica!

491
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,659
Which Veronica?
Charlie?

492
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,912
- Remember Bombay?
- When Charles and I were going out...

493
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,791
...he told me he'd had this...
interesting journey round India...

494
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:20,169
...with Vomiting Veronica.
I think that was it.

495
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,506
I don't remember ever mentioning it.
Maybe I did.

496
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:28,177
Come on, Charles! I don't think I've
ever been out with anyone less discreet.

497
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,972
That's a bit of an exaggeration,
isn't it?

498
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,223
It is not!

499
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,184
I remember you going on
about this girl Helena...

500
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,688
- ...whose mother made a pass at you.
- I remember this!

501
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:43,317
You couldn't work out whether it would
be impolite not to accept her advances!

502
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,320
That's right. Mrs. Piggy!
Helena was Miss Piggy...

503
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,865
...so her mother was Mrs. Piggy!

504
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,742
I think perhaps it was a...

505
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,120
We've both lost a lot of weight
since then.

506
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,879
Ah, great!
The speeches.

507
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:07,049
My lords, ladies and gentlemen...

508
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,343
...pray silence for the best man.

509
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,818
When Bernard told me
he was getting engaged to Lydia...

510
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,236
...I congratulated him

511
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,531
because all his other girlfriends
were such complete dogs!

512
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,330
Although may I say how delighted we are
to have so many of them here today.

513
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,418
I'm particularly delighted
to see Camilla,

514
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,212
who many of you will remember...

515
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,507
...as the first person
Bernard asked to marry him.

516
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,930
If I remember rightly,
she told him to sod off!

517
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,602
And lucky for Lydia that she did.

518
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,485
It's very disappointing!

519
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:15,493
We had the most adorable girl
at our table called Carrie.

520
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:19,789
Apparently her fiancé's awfully grand
and he owns half of Scotland.

521
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:23,292
- How are you?
- I'm stuck in the wedding from hell.

522
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,378
Ghosts of girlfriends past at every turn.

523
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,714
If I meet Henrietta,
the horror will be complete.

524
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,091
Hello, Charles.

525
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,677
Hello, Hen.
How are you?

526
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:35,763
Oh, Hen...

527
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:38,724
Why can't you leave her alone?
Haven't you hurt her enough?

528
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,148
Excuse me. I think I'd better be
where other people are not.

529
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:55,908
Hello.

530
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,440
Yes.

531
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,644
Taxi!

532
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,488
Good night, sir.

533
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,281
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

534
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,571
It's all right.
Oh, God! This is wonderful.

535
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,668
Please!

536
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:21,720
Wait a minute. This is no fun!
I want to see my lovely husband!

537
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:51,292
Who's a very bad bridegroom indeed?

538
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,684
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- Yes.

539
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:11,812
- What's his name?
- Dolph. He's good at table tennis.

540
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:16,192
- What about you?
- No. Afraid not.

541
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,568
Why not?

542
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,862
Don't know.

543
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:26,702
Because most of the blokes I fancy
think I'm stupid and pointless...

544
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:29,455
...so they just bonk me
and then leave me...

545
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,791
...and the kind of blokes
that do fancy me, I think are drips.

546
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,378
I can't even be bothered to bonk them...

547
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,797
...which does sort of
leave me a bit nowhere.

548
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,218
What's booking?

549
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,430
Well, it's kind of like table tennis...

550
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,100
...only with slightly smaller balls.

551
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,084
So good!

552
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:32,059
- I love my wife!
- And I love my husband!

553
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:39,441
- Do you think we'd better get back?
- We could just wait a few minutes...

554
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,110
...and have another go!

555
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:46,657
Naughty, naughty little rabbit!

556
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:52,830
Found it.

557
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,254
Charles!
Charles, we must talk.

558
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,633
Right.
Right.

559
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:08,554
The thing is, Charlie,
I've spoken to lots of people about you.

560
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,638
Oh, God!

561
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:13,100
Everybody agrees
you're in real trouble, Charles.

562
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,310
Am I?

563
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:18,647
You see, you're turning into
a kind of serial monogamist.

564
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:23,068
One girlfriend after another, yet
you never really let anyone near you.

565
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,070
On the contrary...

566
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,324
You're affectionate to them
and sweet to them.

567
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,160
Even to me,
although you thought I was an idiot.

568
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,037
- I did not.
- You did.

569
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,874
- I thought U2 was a type of submarine.
- In a way, you were right.

570
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:40,210
- Their music has a naval quality.
- Be serious, Charles!

571
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:44,006
Give people a chance! You don't
have to think "I must get married"...

572
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:47,676
...but you mustn't start relationships
thinking "I mustn't get married".

573
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:52,014
Most of the time I don't think at all.
I just potter along.

574
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,766
Oh, Charlie!

575
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,977
Oh, God!
The way you used to look at me!

576
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,855
I just misread it, that's all.

577
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,691
I thought you were going to propose...

578
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,527
...and you were just working out
how to leave!

579
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:09,198
- No, no. I wasn't.
- Oh, God, this is ridiculous!

580
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,657
- Hen...
- No.

581
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:13,786
- Hen... Hen...
- No.

582
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,830
- Having a good night?
- Yes,

583
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:19,583
It's... it's right up there
with my father's funeral

584
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,543
for sheer entertainment value.

585
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:26,465
- I thought you'd gone.
- No. Hamish took the Edinburgh sleeper.

586
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,634
I'm off now.
Keep me company?

587
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,150
Here, please.

588
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,278
You wanna come up for a nightcap?

589
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:54,618
- You sure?
- Well, yes. I think we can risk it.

590
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,830
I'm pretty sure I can resist you.
You're not that cute.

591
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,166
Sorry... Yeah, great.

592
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,910
Morning, Charles.
Breakfast's up.

593
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:22,998
- It's a bit burnt.
- Excellent.

594
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,002
What are you up to today?

595
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,712
Oh, yeah...

596
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:34,968
I'm taking advantage of the fact that,
for the first time in my entire life...

597
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,304
...it's Saturday
and I don't have a wedding to go to.

598
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,182
All I have to do
is not be late for David.

599
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,684
I was going to go for a job.

600
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:47,773
This new shop called Spank wants
a sales assistant. I think I'd be great.

601
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,943
- They sell all this funny rubber stuff.
- Oh, no!

602
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,153
Another wedding invitation...

603
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,073
...and a list.
Lovely!

604
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,576
They say rubber's mainly for perverts.

605
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:02,871
Don't know why.
I think it's very practical, actually.

606
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,541
You spill anything on it
and it just comes off.

607
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,960
That could be why the perverts like it.

608
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,295
You all right?

609
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,465
Yeah, yeah.

610
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:18,554
It's that girl... Carrie.
You remember the...

611
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,889
The American.

612
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,444
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt.

613
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,090
Do you have the wedding list for Banks?

614
00:59:36,147 --> 00:59:37,322
Certainly, sir.

615
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,826
Lots of beautiful things
for around about the 1,000 pound mark.

616
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:47,499
What about things around the sort of
50 pound mark? Is there much?

617
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,295
Well, you could get
that Pygmy warrior over there.

618
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,923
This?
Excellent!

619
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,051
If you could find someone
to chip in the other 3,950.

620
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:01,430
Or our carrier bags are 1 .50 each.

621
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,599
Why don't you just get 33 of them?

622
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,061
Well, I...
I think I'll probably leave it.

623
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,690
Thanks very much.
You've been very...

624
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,611
- What did you get?
- Blimey!

625
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,030
Well, I never!

626
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:21,158
Nothing yet.
I'm just, you know, deciding.

627
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,870
- It's nice to see you.
- It's nice to see you.

628
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:30,500
This present thing is great.
I should've gotten married years ago.

629
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,503
- Anybody get the Pygmy?
- The young man thought about it...

630
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,340
Oh, no!

631
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,842
Just... just get me an ashtray.

632
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:42,763
Are you free for about a half-hour?

633
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,640
Yeah, yeah.

634
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,851
I'm meeting my brother,
but... I can be a bit late.

635
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:51,313
Oh, good!
You have an important decision to make.

636
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:54,858
- Now, you mustn't laugh!
- OK. Right.

637
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,784
What do you think?

638
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,664
Divine.

639
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,667
Bit of a meringue?

640
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,504
Don't worry.
We've only just begun!

641
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,217
What do you think?

642
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,388
- You're kidding.
- But it would be wonderful.

643
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,014
Maybe next time.

644
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,185
What do you think?

645
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,650
I knew it.

646
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:39,361
With a staff, you could look after sheep!

647
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,737
Don't be rude!

648
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,490
It's a bit sexy, this.

649
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,284
Well...

650
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,870
If I were your husband,
I would die of pride.

651
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:52,541
You may be right.
It is dangerous.

652
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,669
There's nothing worse at a wedding
than a priest with an erection.

653
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:05,262
It's strange thinking
you'll never sleep with anyone else.

654
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:09,933
- You don't think you'll be unfaithful?
- No. Not once I'm married.

655
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:13,145
I told Hamish I'll kill him if he does,
so I'd better stick to that.

656
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,813
Quite right.

657
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,816
Anyway, I reckon I've had
my fair run at it.

658
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:22,070
What is a fair run these days,
down your way?

659
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,030
I don't know.

660
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,075
More than one.

661
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,661
Well, come on!
Tell me.

662
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,539
I've seen the dress.
We have no secrets.

663
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,337
Well...

664
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,257
The first one...

665
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:46,344
...of course not easily forgotten,
was kinda nice.

666
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:51,391
Two... hairy back.

667
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,976
Three, four, five...

668
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:57,272
Six, was on my birthday
in my parents' room.

669
01:02:57,356 --> 01:03:00,025
- Which birthday?
- 17th.

670
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,278
- We've only reached 17?
- I grew up in the country.

671
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:05,238
Lots of rolling around in haystacks.

672
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,950
OK.
Seven...

673
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:12,913
Eight... unfortunately, was quite a shock.

674
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:17,667
Nine, against a fence.
Very uncomfortable. Don't try it.

675
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:18,794
I won't.

676
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:22,631
10, was gorgeous.
Just heaven, just...

677
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,717
- He was wonderful!
- I hate him.

678
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:31,056
11, obviously after 10, disappointing.

679
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,975
12 through 17, the university years.

680
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,603
Sensitive, caring, intelligent boys.

681
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:38,772
Sexually speaking, a real low patch.

682
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:43,485
18, broke my heart.

683
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:46,238
- Years of yearning.
- I'm sorry.

684
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:49,407
20... Oh, my God!
I can't believe I've reached 20.

685
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:53,370
21, elephant tongue.

686
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,750
22 kept falling asleep.
That was my first year in England.

687
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:02,003
- I do apologize.
- 23 and 24 together.

688
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,505
- That was something!
- Seriously?

689
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:05,882
27... That was a mistake.

690
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:11,012
- Suddenly at 27 you make a mistake?
- Yes, he kept screaming.

691
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,598
Very off-putting.
I nearly gave up on the whole thing.

692
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:17,060
But Spencer changed my mind.
That's 28.

693
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:20,188
- His father, 29.
- With his father?

694
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,482
30...

695
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:25,068
31... oh, my God.

696
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:29,739
32... was lovely.

697
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:34,244
And then my fiancé, that's 33.

698
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:41,835
So, I... came after your fiancé?

699
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,628
No, you were 32.

700
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:48,508
So there you go.

701
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:51,136
Less than Madonna,
more than Princess Di - I hope!

702
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,140
And how about you?
How many have you slept with?

703
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,976
Christ! Nothing like that many.
I don't know...

704
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:01,980
I don't know what the fuck
I've been doing with my time.

705
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:06,192
Work, probably. Yeah, work.
I have been working late... a lot.

706
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,411
I wish I'd rung you.

707
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:20,415
But then you never rang me.

708
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:24,753
You ruthlessly slept with me twice
and never rang me.

709
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:32,093
Oh, bollocks!

710
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:34,429
Help me, please!
Please!

711
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:50,737
Carrie, this is David, my brother.

712
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,408
Hi.

713
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:13,176
I was just telling him about
you marrying Hamish...

714
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,595
...and he said it couldn't have happened
to a nicer fellow.

715
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,769
- Where are you doing it?
- Scotland.

716
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:31,069
He says that's a beautiful place.
Hilly.

717
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,656
You should come to the wedding, too.

718
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:38,493
I want lots of friends to make up for
the gruesome stiffs that Hamish knows.

719
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,706
Well, you'd better go in.

720
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,499
Bye.

721
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,668
- Bye.
- Bye.

722
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:58,805
Fuck it!

723
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,487
Look.
Sorry.

724
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:17,490
Sorry.
I just, well...

725
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,100
This is a really stupid question...

726
01:07:19,184 --> 01:07:22,120
...particularly in view
of our shopping excursion...

727
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:26,124
...but, I just wondered if by any chance...

728
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:31,296
I mean, obviously not, because
I've only slept with nine people.

729
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,715
But I just wondered...

730
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:36,468
I really feel...

731
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,471
In short, to recap
in a slightly clearer version...

732
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:45,393
...in the words of David Cassidy, while
still with the Partridge Family...

733
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:48,730
...I think I love you.
And...

734
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:54,069
I just wondered whether by
any chance you wouldn't like to...

735
01:07:57,073 --> 01:08:00,033
No. No.
No, of course not.

736
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,620
I am an idiot.
He's not.

737
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:06,331
Excellent. Excellent.
Fantastic.

738
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:09,667
Lovely to see you.
Sorry to disturb. Better get on.

739
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:12,879
- Fuck!
- That was very romantic.

740
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:19,377
Well, I thought it over a lot, you know.
I wanted to get it just right.

741
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,682
Important to have said it, I think.

742
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,811
Said what, exactly?

743
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:33,942
Said, you know, what I just said about...

744
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,195
...David Cassidy.

745
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,242
You're lovely.

746
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:40,175
It was ordained for lifelong faithful
relationships and conjugal love.

747
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,928
It was ordained for the
welfare of human society...

748
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,805
...which can be strong and happy...

749
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,850
...only when the marriage bond
is held in honor.

750
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:54,814
Into this holy estate
these two persons now desire to enter.

751
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:59,068
Wherefore, if anyone can show
any just cause...

752
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:02,363
...why they may not lawfully
be joined together in marriage...

753
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,532
...let him now declare it.

754
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,330
Sorry.

755
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:12,290
Please rise.

756
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:21,174
Do you, Hamish, take this woman
Caroline to be your wedded wife...

757
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:24,844
...and do you, in the presence of God
and before this congregation...

758
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:29,682
...promise and covenant to be to her
a loving and faithful husband...

759
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,268
...until God shall separate you by death?

760
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,145
I do.

761
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:39,317
Do you, Caroline, take this man Hamish
to be your wedded husband...

762
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:42,946
...and do you, in the presence of God
and before this congregation...

763
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:47,075
...promise and covenant to be to him
a loving and faithful wife...

764
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,577
...until God shall separate you by death?

765
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:50,912
I do.

766
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:53,289
As a token of the covenant...

767
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,124
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!

768
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,418
...these rings are given and received.

769
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,212
By these signs...

770
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,944
- How awfully nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

771
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:25,822
How do you do?

772
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,199
- Hello.
- Fred...

773
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:33,079
You look beautiful.
Not a meringue in sight.

774
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:34,414
Thanks.

775
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,964
Blimey!

776
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:46,718
It's Brigadoon!
It's bloody Brigadoon!

777
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:01,065
Dear old things, as you know,
I've always been proud...

778
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:04,319
...that there's not a wedding ring
between the lot of us.

779
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:08,281
Over the passing of the years,
it's beginning to distress me.

780
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:12,410
I'd like to go to the wedding
of someone I really loved for a change.

781
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:15,663
Don't blame me.
I've asked practically everyone I know.

782
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,333
- You haven't asked me.
- Haven't I?

783
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,377
Scarlett... Well, would you like to?

784
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:24,505
No, thank you.
It was very nice of you to ask.

785
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,174
Well... Any time.

786
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:29,135
Quite right, Tom, quite right.
That's the spirit.

787
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:32,305
Tonight, these are your orders.

788
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:36,851
Go forth and conjugate.
Find husbands and wives.

789
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:40,563
Excellent. What do you think, Fifi?
Spot a potential hubby?

790
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:42,648
- Bugger off, Tom.
- Quite right.

791
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,860
A toast... before we go into battle.

792
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:48,905
True love.

793
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:51,407
In whatever shape or form it may come.

794
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:57,163
May we all in our dotage be proud to say
"I was adored once, too."

795
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,750
- True love.
- True love!

796
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:12,595
Apparently, an enormous number of people...

797
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:15,932
...actually bump into
their future spouses at weddings...

798
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:17,934
...which is interesting.

799
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:21,145
- Yes, I met my husband at a wedding.
- Ah.

800
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:31,697
Good Lord, I seem to have finished
my drink. If you'll excuse me.

801
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,790
Hello.
My name's Scarlett.

802
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:43,668
Named after Scarlett O'Hara,
but much less trouble.

803
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,629
- What's your name?
- My name's Rhett.

804
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:48,965
No...

805
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:51,342
- Not really?
- No, not really.

806
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,429
- In fact, it's Chester.
- You kidder!

807
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:59,100
I always imagine Americans
are gonna be dull as shit.

808
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:00,852
Of course you're not, are you?

809
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:03,187
Steve Martin's American, isn't he?

810
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,566
Yes, he is.

811
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:08,734
You're lovely!

812
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,446
Come on!

813
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:19,370
Hello, Charles.

814
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,832
Oh, Hen.
Hi.

815
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:26,043
Look, I couldn't really bear a scene today.

816
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,296
I know we've probably
got tons to talk about...

817
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:31,382
Did I behave that atrociously last time?

818
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:36,012
Well, you remember
the shower scene in Psycho?

819
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:37,430
Scarier.

820
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:41,267
God, I'm depressed, Hen!
How are you?

821
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:45,813
I'm cheerful! I weigh almost nothing
and I've got a divine new boyfriend.

822
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,068
Perhaps you were right.
We should've got married.

823
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,404
No!
I'd have had to marry your friends...

824
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:57,283
- ...and I'm not sure I could take Fiona.
- Fiona loves you.

825
01:14:57,367 --> 01:15:01,287
- Fiona calls me Duckface.
- Well, I never heard that.

826
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:04,749
Look, darling, come to lunch soon.
Give me a ring.

827
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,584
Still cute!

828
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,424
How's Duckface?

829
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,801
Good form, actually. Not too mad.

830
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:19,847
Ladies and gentlemen...

831
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,974
...the bride and groom!

832
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:01,639
You like this girl, don't you?

833
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:06,310
Yes.

834
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:10,815
Yes, it's...

835
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:14,569
It's a strange thing
when at last it happens.

836
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,321
And...

837
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,532
...she's marrying someone else.

838
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:32,378
How about you, Fifi? Have you identified
a future partner for life yet?

839
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,006
No need, really.

840
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:39,427
The deed is done.

841
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,679
I've been in love
with the same bloke for ages.

842
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:46,475
Have you?
Who's that?

843
01:16:47,811 --> 01:16:49,020
You, Charlie.

844
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,207
It's always been you.

845
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:13,794
Since first we met...

846
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:17,048
...so many years ago.

847
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,134
I knew the first moment.

848
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:24,055
Across a crowded room!
A lawn, in fact.

849
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:31,187
Doesn't matter.

850
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:36,192
Nothing either of us can do on this one.
Such is life.

851
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:44,825
Friends isn't... bad, you know.

852
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,702
Friends... is quite something.

853
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:50,414
Oh, Fi...

854
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:55,753
Fi...

855
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,928
It's not all easy, is it?

856
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:06,847
No.

857
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:11,477
Just forget this business.
Not to be.

858
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:17,108
Matthew, darling.

859
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:21,529
- Where's Gareth?
- Torturing Americans.

860
01:18:21,613 --> 01:18:23,489
How thoughtful of him.

861
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:30,496
Do you actually know Oscar Wilde?

862
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:33,124
Not personally, no.

863
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:38,629
But I do know someone
who could get his fax number for you.

864
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,589
Shall we dance?

865
01:19:26,344 --> 01:19:28,345
Well?
Any rings on fingers?

866
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,182
Gareth, you don't know how lucky you are.

867
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,768
Finding someone to marry
is a tricky business.

868
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:38,481
It's hell out there! Matthew's trapped
with an evangelist from Minnesota.

869
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:41,233
Sweet Jesus, cast out the devil!

870
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:46,906
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
please charge your glasses.

871
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:51,202
First, and rather unusually,
we have the bride.

872
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,830
Excellent.
I love this girl.

873
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:57,792
Thank you.

874
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:03,589
First of all, I'd like to thank all of
you who've flown in from the States.

875
01:20:05,425 --> 01:20:06,425
As for the rest of you,

876
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,969
I'd have thought that lots
of frightful Americans flying in...

877
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:12,014
...was an excuse for staying away.
So I thank you, too.

878
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:20,481
If my darling dad had been here today,
he would have been speaking now...

879
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:22,942
...and I know what he would have said:

880
01:20:23,026 --> 01:20:24,401
"Great dress, babe,

881
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:27,154
but why in the hell are you
marrying the stiff in the skirt?"

882
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,995
And I would have given him
the same answer that I give you:

883
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:37,498
"Because I love him."

884
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:41,043
As John Lennon said,
who died the same year as my dad...

885
01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:44,880
..."Love is the answer,
and you know that for sure."

886
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:53,472
And, one more thing.

887
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:55,850
Someone told me here that,

888
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:58,310
if things with Hamish didn't work out,
he would step in.

889
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:00,771
Thanks, and I'll keep you posted.

890
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:07,486
Bravo!

891
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:11,532
Now, my lords, ladies and gentlemen,
Sir Hamish Banks.

892
01:21:18,164 --> 01:21:21,041
Anyone involved in politics
for the last 20 years...

893
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,794
...has got used to being
upstaged by a woman!

894
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:28,215
I didn't expect it to happen to me
on my wedding day!

895
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:32,803
However, I must also say
that I'm quite happy...

896
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:36,682
...to be upstaged by this woman
for the rest of my life.

897
01:21:36,766 --> 01:21:40,477
Is that some barracking at the back?
We politicians are used to that.

898
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:44,315
- Shit! Find a... find a doctor!
- Right. OK.

899
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,234
First of all,
my compliments to the bridesmaids.

900
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:49,069
You did your duties superbly.

901
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:53,908
And obviously I intend to use you
every time I get married from now on!

902
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:04,001
I want to thank all those
wonderful ladies of the parish...

903
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:05,794
...who did the flowers in the church.

904
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:10,591
The stern old building took on
a look of flushed youth today.

905
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:22,853
I remember the first time
I laid eyes on Caroline.

906
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:27,149
"If by any chance
she's short-sighted...

907
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:31,070
...I might just be happy
for the rest of my life."

908
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:35,783
I thought I could see my future
for the first time.

909
01:22:35,867 --> 01:22:41,288
It was a joyful one
for years and years to come.

910
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:51,131
<i>For they are jolly good fellows</i>

911
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:59,098
<i>For they are jolly good fellows</i>

912
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:01,433
<i>And so say all of us</i>

913
01:24:12,505 --> 01:24:16,884
Good morning, and a warm welcome
to you all on this cold day.

914
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:19,970
Our service will begin in a few minutes.

915
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:24,892
But first we have asked Matthew,
Gareth's closest friend...

916
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:26,643
...to say a few words.

917
01:24:35,945 --> 01:24:38,614
Gareth used to prefer funerals
to weddings.

918
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:42,326
He said it was easier to get
enthusiastic...

919
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:45,746
...about a ceremony one had an outside
chance of eventually being involved in.

920
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:52,127
In order to prepare this speech,
I rang a few people...

921
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:55,422
...to get a general picture of how Gareth
was regarded by those who met him.

922
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:01,804
"Fat" seems to have been a word
people most connected with him.

923
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:07,434
"Terribly rude" also rang a lot of bells.

924
01:25:09,562 --> 01:25:11,438
So "very fat" and "very rude"...

925
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,732
...seems to have been
the stranger's viewpoint.

926
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:19,446
But some of you have rung me
and let me know that you loved him...

927
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,657
...which I know he would have been
thrilled to hear.

928
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:28,747
You remember his fabulous hospitality,
his strange experimental cooking.

929
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:35,587
The recipe for duck a la banana
fortunately goes with him to his grave.

930
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:42,511
Most of all, you tell me of
his enormous capacity for joy.

931
01:25:42,595 --> 01:25:45,889
And, when joyful...

932
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:48,892
...when joyful,
for highly vocal drunkenness.

933
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:54,064
I hope joyful is how
you will remember him.

934
01:25:56,901 --> 01:25:59,069
Not stuck in a box in a church.

935
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:06,034
Pick your favorite of his waistcoats
and remember him that way.

936
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:11,081
The most splendid, replete...

937
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:14,001
...big-hearted...

938
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:17,963
...weak-hearted, as it turned out...

939
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:21,967
...and jolly bugger most of us ever met.

940
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:27,806
As for me, you may ask
how I will remember him.

941
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:31,727
What I thought of him.

942
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:38,692
Unfortunately, there I run out of words.

943
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:45,365
Forgive me
if I turn from my own feelings...

944
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:49,995
...to the words of another
splendid bugger, W.H. Auden.

945
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,207
This is actually what I want to say:

946
01:26:57,295 --> 01:27:00,881
Stop all the clocks,
cut off the telephone,

947
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:05,135
Prevent the dog from barking
with a juicy bone,

948
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:10,599
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum

949
01:27:10,683 --> 01:27:15,395
Bring out the coffin,
let the mourners come.

950
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:20,275
Let the airplanes circle moaning overhead

951
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:24,446
Scribbling on the sky the message
He Is Dead.

952
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:29,826
Put crepe bows round the white necks
of the public doves,

953
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:35,332
Let traffic policemen
wear black cotton gloves.

954
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:41,380
He was my North, my South,
my East and West.

955
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:46,218
My working week and my Sunday rest,

956
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:52,266
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;

957
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:57,271
I thought that love would last for ever:

958
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:00,691
I was wrong.

959
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:06,905
The stars are not wanted now:

960
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,033
Put out every one;

961
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:14,538
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;

962
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:20,085
Pour away the ocean
and sweep up the wood;

963
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:25,549
For nothing now
can ever come to any good.

964
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:07,507
It was good of you to come. Must have
been the shortest honeymoon in history.

965
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:10,302
No, it's fine.
We'll do it some other time.

966
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:17,451
You know, what you said in the street...

967
01:29:17,535 --> 01:29:20,829
- Yes, I'm sorry about that.
- No, I liked it.

968
01:29:21,647 --> 01:29:22,856
I liked you saying it.

969
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:37,037
Charlie, I'll take Scarlett home,
all right?

970
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:40,165
Yeah.
Darling Fi.

971
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:54,221
- Walk, Charlie?
- Yeah. Yeah, that would be grand.

972
01:29:57,475 --> 01:30:01,144
Never felt like that.
I mean, something vaguely similar...

973
01:30:01,813 --> 01:30:04,523
...for Jilly... when I was young.

974
01:30:04,607 --> 01:30:07,484
- Jilly?
- Labrador.

975
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:11,530
Yes, it's odd, isn't it?

976
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:14,783
All these years
we've been single and proud of it...

977
01:30:14,867 --> 01:30:19,079
...and never noticed that two of us were,
in effect, married all this time.

978
01:30:19,997 --> 01:30:21,748
Traitors in our midst.

979
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:30,382
You know, I think death is hardest
for the parents, don't you?

980
01:30:30,466 --> 01:30:32,384
I hope I die before my children.

981
01:30:32,468 --> 01:30:37,514
Tom...
There's one thing I find really...

982
01:30:40,476 --> 01:30:44,729
Well... It's your total confidence
that you will get married.

983
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:47,566
I mean, what if
you never find the right girl?

984
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:49,901
Sorry?

985
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:51,862
Surely, if that service shows anything...

986
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:56,116
...it shows that there is such a thing
as a perfect match.

987
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:02,205
If we can't be like Gareth and Matthew,
then maybe we should just let it go.

988
01:31:02,915 --> 01:31:05,459
Some of us are not gonna get married.

989
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:07,377
Well, I don't know, Charlie.

990
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:13,592
The truth is, unlike you,
I never expected the thunderbolt.

991
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:18,472
I always just hoped that I'd meet
some nice, friendly girl...

992
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:22,809
...like the look of her, hope the look of
me didn't make her physically sick...

993
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:28,565
...then pop the question and...
settle down and... be happy.

994
01:31:29,775 --> 01:31:33,153
It worked for my parents.
Well, apart from the divorce...

995
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:36,072
I'll give you six months
at the outside, Tom.

996
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:39,284
Yeah, maybe you're right.

997
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:44,831
Maybe all this waiting
for one-true-love stuff...

998
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,583
...gets you nowhere.

999
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:06,645
What the fuck is going on?

1000
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:13,944
I thought we'd better make
absolutely sure we weren't late.

1001
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:17,489
Excellent wedding hairstyle.

1002
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:24,913
Matthew... the best-looking
best man in the world.

1003
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:29,626
Listen...
Thank you for doing this today.

1004
01:32:30,127 --> 01:32:31,461
Of course.

1005
01:32:34,757 --> 01:32:36,258
I wish Gareth was here.

1006
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:39,135
Bet he does, too.

1007
01:32:42,431 --> 01:32:45,976
I'm sorry we're so late.
The others are just parking the car.

1008
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,561
I thought we'd all go with Tom.

1009
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:52,232
- Late? So late?
- Yeah. It's 9:45.

1010
01:32:52,316 --> 01:32:56,403
- 9:45?
- Yep. 45 minutes till "I do".

1011
01:32:56,487 --> 01:32:59,781
Bloody Tom!
I told him to set the alarm for eight!

1012
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:02,659
Fuck it!
Fuck!

1013
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:09,916
- Scarlett.
- Hi!

1014
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:13,336
- You ready?
- Absolutely. Give me 20 seconds.

1015
01:33:23,472 --> 01:33:24,556
- Time.
- Honestly?

1016
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:28,101
- Yes! Time!
- It's about ten to nine.

1017
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:48,038
Bastards.

1018
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:53,543
Jessica, stop jumping up and down, please.

1019
01:33:57,381 --> 01:34:00,884
One, two, three, smile!

1020
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:04,804
This is splendid tuck.

1021
01:34:04,889 --> 01:34:06,890
Yes, I think I might say a little word.

1022
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:13,188
As you know, I've been a close observer
of Charles's love life for many years.

1023
01:34:13,272 --> 01:34:16,524
But recently I'd started
to despair and fear

1024
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:18,318
that really he was married to us...

1025
01:34:18,402 --> 01:34:21,029
...except that we
won't have his babies.

1026
01:34:21,113 --> 01:34:22,614
I don't know about that.

1027
01:34:22,698 --> 01:34:26,284
But it's all turned out splendidly.
The girl is sadly crazy...

1028
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:28,578
...but perhaps that's why he loves her.

1029
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:32,040
I'd like to propose a toast
to my Charlie and his beautiful girl

1030
01:34:32,124 --> 01:34:33,708
on this tragic day.

1031
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:37,504
- So, be happy and don't forget us.
- Thank you.

1032
01:34:37,588 --> 01:34:41,383
- To Charles and Duckface.
- Charles and Duckface!

1033
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:49,849
- What do you think?
- You look divine.

1034
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:53,144
It does work, doesn't it?
Yes.

1035
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:59,192
I'd like to thank Fiona for those
charming words about my future wife.

1036
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:04,114
I'd like to take this opportunity
to read a message from her to you all.

1037
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:05,865
This is exciting!

1038
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:09,869
She says "Any of you come near
the house, I'll set the dogs on you."

1039
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:12,539
I think that's a nice touch.

1040
01:35:12,623 --> 01:35:14,416
Sweet!
Sweet.

1041
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,626
"Set the dogs on you"!

1042
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:20,422
John, hi.

1043
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:23,550
- John, you made it.
- Oh, yes.

1044
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:27,387
I hope me damn sister turns up.
Not much of a wedding without a bride.

1045
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:30,014
- Tom!
- Hello, John.

1046
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:32,350
Bit of a poor show
you not having a stag night.

1047
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:34,185
We did!
We did!

1048
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:37,981
We didn't think it was a very good idea
in this day and age.

1049
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:41,067
Really?

1050
01:35:59,795 --> 01:36:01,713
Fi, you do look lovely today.

1051
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:07,927
- I've abandoned my traditional black.
- Yes, so you have.

1052
01:36:08,012 --> 01:36:10,597
From now on, I shall be
all the colors of the rainbow...

1053
01:36:10,681 --> 01:36:13,183
...and fall in love with someone
who fancies me for a change.

1054
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:16,728
Darling Fi!

1055
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:26,279
- Look.
- What?

1056
01:36:26,363 --> 01:36:28,823
Lipstick everywhere.
That won't do at all.

1057
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:33,787
- Hi.
- Hi.

1058
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:52,388
Good luck.

1059
01:36:57,728 --> 01:37:00,563
Hello.
Glad you could come.

1060
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:04,275
Groom's on the right.
Bride's on the left.

1061
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:11,407
- Groom on the right. Bride on the left.
- Oh, my God!

1062
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,956
I thought you'd gone back to Texas!

1063
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,875
Without you, never.

1064
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:26,756
Good luck.

1065
01:37:31,387 --> 01:37:37,058
Bride or groom?

1066
01:37:37,142 --> 01:37:42,564
It should be perfectly obvious I'm neither.
Great God!

1067
01:37:43,607 --> 01:37:46,401
- Bride or groom?
- Bride.

1068
01:37:56,453 --> 01:37:59,706
Yes...
I'm fine.

1069
01:38:03,085 --> 01:38:05,545
You know, I've a feeling
we've met before.

1070
01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:08,673
We have.
About 25 years ago.

1071
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,844
I'm second cousin Harold's
daughter Deirdre. You're Tom.

1072
01:38:12,928 --> 01:38:14,387
Good Lord!

1073
01:38:14,471 --> 01:38:16,973
- So, you're family.
- Yes.

1074
01:38:17,975 --> 01:38:21,936
- Only very distant.
- Well, yes... of course.

1075
01:38:23,772 --> 01:38:26,900
You said you were bride?

1076
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:28,401
Yes.

1077
01:38:28,485 --> 01:38:30,737
Well, do sit.

1078
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:33,197
Do sit here, Deirdre.

1079
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:39,120
Golly!

1080
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:41,789
Thunderbolt city.

1081
01:38:43,208 --> 01:38:45,668
- Hello, Matthew.
- Nice to see you.

1082
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:47,962
- Hello, Charles.
- Bernard. How are you?

1083
01:38:48,839 --> 01:38:51,466
- Exhausted, actually.
- Oh, bunny!

1084
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:53,092
- Charles.
- Hello, Lyd.

1085
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:01,184
- Hi.
- Hi.

1086
01:39:03,187 --> 01:39:07,523
You look lovely. But then I always
did like you dressed for weddings.

1087
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:10,735
- And on time.
- Yeah! Extraordinary thing, isn't it?

1088
01:39:11,695 --> 01:39:16,115
- How's Hamish?
- He's fine... I believe.

1089
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:18,952
- You believe?
- Well, yes.

1090
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:21,037
He wasn't the man for me after all.

1091
01:39:24,583 --> 01:39:27,251
- You left him?
- We left each other.

1092
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:34,300
- When?
- A few months now.

1093
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:37,971
March was... hell.
By April, it was sordid.

1094
01:39:38,055 --> 01:39:40,807
That's the last time
I marry someone three times my age.

1095
01:39:40,891 --> 01:39:43,893
Charles, time to travel.

1096
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:46,479
Yeah.
Yeah.

1097
01:39:49,066 --> 01:39:51,401
Coming.
Good. Good...

1098
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:58,700
- So why didn't you get in touch, then?
- I did think about it.

1099
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:03,121
I wanted to, but, I was in a state.

1100
01:40:05,082 --> 01:40:08,042
So, anyway, I don't want to keep you.

1101
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:11,462
And... I'll see you afterwards.

1102
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:13,673
Yeah.
Fine.

1103
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:15,133
Wait!

1104
01:40:20,597 --> 01:40:22,807
I'll show you to your seat.

1105
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,644
Just showing her to her seat.

1106
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:41,617
Our timing's been really bad, hasn't it?

1107
01:40:42,244 --> 01:40:44,370
It's been bad, yes.

1108
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:46,289
It's been a disaster.

1109
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:48,875
It has, as you say, been...

1110
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:52,462
...very bad indeed.

1111
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,593
God, it's lovely to see you!

1112
01:41:01,638 --> 01:41:03,139
Well, good luck.

1113
01:41:04,141 --> 01:41:08,770
It's pretty easy. Just say "I do"
whenever anyone asks you a question.

1114
01:41:18,655 --> 01:41:20,907
Could you just give me a sec, Matthew?

1115
01:41:20,991 --> 01:41:24,452
Yes, of course.
Freshen up at will.

1116
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,098
Dear Lord...

1117
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,850
...forgive me for what I'm about to...

1118
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:54,816
...say in this magnificent
place of worship.

1119
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,527
Bugger.

1120
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:00,822
Bugger!

1121
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:04,283
Bugger! Bugger!
Bugger!

1122
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:05,827
Bugger!

1123
01:42:08,163 --> 01:42:09,914
Can I help at all?

1124
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:12,834
No.
Thanks.

1125
01:42:12,918 --> 01:42:14,669
Sorry.

1126
01:42:14,753 --> 01:42:18,422
Vocal exercises.
Big church.

1127
01:42:18,507 --> 01:42:20,591
Excellent.
Often do the same myself.

1128
01:42:20,676 --> 01:42:25,596
Not exactly the same vocab, obviously.
Rather more alleluias!

1129
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,266
I'll leave you.

1130
01:42:46,743 --> 01:42:48,995
- Bride's arriving.
- Fabulous!

1131
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:50,913
We seem to have lost the groom.

1132
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:54,417
Stall her and I'll see if I can find him.

1133
01:42:54,501 --> 01:42:55,918
Roger.
Wilco.

1134
01:43:03,635 --> 01:43:05,761
Charles.

1135
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:08,472
It's good to see you.

1136
01:43:11,768 --> 01:43:13,603
Yeah.
Yeah.

1137
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:19,775
Matt, what do we think about marriage?

1138
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:22,278
Well... Gosh!

1139
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:25,948
Well, I think it's really good...

1140
01:43:26,617 --> 01:43:28,659
...if you love the person
with all your heart.

1141
01:43:29,953 --> 01:43:33,164
Well, exactly.
Quite.

1142
01:43:36,793 --> 01:43:40,504
All these weddings.
All these... years.

1143
01:43:42,132 --> 01:43:44,800
All that blasted salmon and champagne.

1144
01:43:45,552 --> 01:43:51,474
Here I am on my own
wedding day and I'm still thinking.

1145
01:43:52,517 --> 01:43:54,143
Can I ask about what?

1146
01:43:57,481 --> 01:43:58,731
No.

1147
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:01,108
No, I think best not.

1148
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:05,738
I'm sorry, there's a delay.
A problem with the flowers.

1149
01:44:05,822 --> 01:44:07,156
Flowers?

1150
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:09,742
There seems to be
a staggeringly high proportion

1151
01:44:09,826 --> 01:44:11,202
of hay fever sufferers...

1152
01:44:11,286 --> 01:44:13,579
...and they're right next
to the damn flowers.

1153
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:16,415
So we're moving the congregation.

1154
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,918
Don't want the vows
obliterated by sneezing.

1155
01:44:19,002 --> 01:44:22,296
Charles, would it be out of place
for me to say that time is ticking by?

1156
01:44:44,903 --> 01:44:46,862
Should have started by now.

1157
01:44:49,032 --> 01:44:50,866
I think I've fooled them so far.

1158
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:54,412
When people think you're stupid,
they're less suspicious.

1159
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:19,061
Hello.

1160
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:21,981
Here you are!

1161
01:45:22,065 --> 01:45:23,566
Ready to face the enemy?

1162
01:45:25,902 --> 01:45:26,944
Are we?

1163
01:45:31,533 --> 01:45:32,742
Yes.

1164
01:45:34,911 --> 01:45:36,078
Excellent.

1165
01:46:31,259 --> 01:46:32,843
Not so tight, Dad!

1166
01:47:02,124 --> 01:47:06,627
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God...

1167
01:47:06,711 --> 01:47:09,296
...and in the face of this
congregation...

1168
01:47:09,381 --> 01:47:12,425
...to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony...

1169
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:14,760
...which is an honorable estate...

1170
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:18,764
...instituted of God
in the time of man's innocence...

1171
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:23,853
...signifying unto us the mystical union
that is betwixt Christ and his Church...

1172
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:27,523
...and therefore is not
by any to be enterprised...

1173
01:47:27,607 --> 01:47:31,944
...nor taken in hand unadvisedly,
lightly, or wantonly...

1174
01:47:32,028 --> 01:47:35,448
...but reverently, discreetly,
advisedly...

1175
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:36,991
...soberly...

1176
01:47:37,075 --> 01:47:39,076
...and in the fear of God.

1177
01:47:40,036 --> 01:47:42,746
Therefore, if any man
can show any just cause...

1178
01:47:42,831 --> 01:47:45,374
...why they may not
lawfully be joined together...

1179
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:50,045
...let him speak now or else hereafter
for ever hold his peace.

1180
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:58,053
I'm sorry.
Does someone have something to say?

1181
01:48:04,561 --> 01:48:06,061
Yes?
What is it?

1182
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:10,399
One second.

1183
01:48:21,244 --> 01:48:23,787
- What's going on, Charles?
- Charles, what?

1184
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:28,918
He wants me to...
translate what he's saying.

1185
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:31,295
What is he saying?

1186
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:36,008
He says "I suspect
the groom is having doubts.

1187
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:39,720
I suspect the groom would like to delay.

1188
01:48:41,723 --> 01:48:43,224
I suspect the groom...

1189
01:48:44,392 --> 01:48:45,768
I suspect the groom..."

1190
01:48:58,031 --> 01:48:59,782
What's he saying?

1191
01:49:03,245 --> 01:49:04,495
He says...

1192
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:07,164
...he suspects the groom...

1193
01:49:08,917 --> 01:49:10,834
...loves someone else.

1194
01:49:11,962 --> 01:49:13,629
Do you?

1195
01:49:13,713 --> 01:49:16,549
Do you love someone else?
Do you, Charles?

1196
01:49:28,311 --> 01:49:30,729
I do.

1197
01:49:36,069 --> 01:49:39,446
Get out of my way!
Let me kill him!

1198
01:49:48,373 --> 01:49:50,040
Blimey!

1199
01:49:51,876 --> 01:49:54,336
At least it's one we won't forget.

1200
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:57,506
A lot of weddings
just blend into each other, don't they?

1201
01:49:57,591 --> 01:50:01,343
- For God's sake!
- This one will stick out in the memory.

1202
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:03,846
For not actually including
a wedding service.

1203
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:07,016
Poor girl.
No, I mean it! Poor girl!

1204
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:08,559
She's not my favorite person,

1205
01:50:08,643 --> 01:50:11,270
but I think what you did today
was unforgivable.

1206
01:50:11,354 --> 01:50:12,980
I can't bear to think about it.

1207
01:50:14,858 --> 01:50:16,233
Poor Hen.

1208
01:50:16,318 --> 01:50:20,195
- Though... let's face facts.
- I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

1209
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:23,699
If you weren't sure you wanted
to marry her today of all days...

1210
01:50:23,783 --> 01:50:25,701
...i.e., your wedding day...

1211
01:50:27,412 --> 01:50:29,413
...then it must be the right decision,
mustn't it?

1212
01:50:31,791 --> 01:50:32,791
Quite right.

1213
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:36,086
It was a lovely dress.
I'm sure she'll find it useful for parties.

1214
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:44,136
- What did he say, Charles?
- Says he blames himself.

1215
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:47,222
- Absolutely not.
- No, you mustn't, David.

1216
01:50:51,561 --> 01:50:53,771
No, no.
If there's music to be faced...

1217
01:50:53,855 --> 01:50:55,564
...I should be facing it.

1218
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:06,450
Hello.

1219
01:51:07,744 --> 01:51:10,663
- Hi! You're soaking. Come in.
- No, no. I'm fine.

1220
01:51:10,747 --> 01:51:12,665
Comes a point when you can't get wetter.

1221
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:15,250
- OK, I'll come out.
- No, please don't. I...

1222
01:51:16,252 --> 01:51:18,420
I just wanted to check you're OK.

1223
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:22,174
Not busy killing yourself
or anything, but...

1224
01:51:24,052 --> 01:51:25,552
But you're fine, so...

1225
01:51:28,264 --> 01:51:31,433
I shouldn't have come to the church
this morning. I'm sorry.

1226
01:51:32,811 --> 01:51:33,852
No!
No!

1227
01:51:35,438 --> 01:51:39,942
Wait. It was all my fault.
I mean, I'm the bastard here.

1228
01:51:41,486 --> 01:51:43,237
And it sorted out one thing.

1229
01:51:43,321 --> 01:51:47,157
Marriage and me were...
very clearly not meant for one another.

1230
01:51:48,410 --> 01:51:50,202
It sorted out another big thing, too.

1231
01:51:50,286 --> 01:51:52,079
There I was,
standing there in the church...

1232
01:51:52,163 --> 01:51:55,249
...and for the first time
in my whole life I realized I...

1233
01:51:56,793 --> 01:51:58,961
...totally and utterly loved one person.

1234
01:52:00,547 --> 01:52:03,382
And it wasn't the person
next to me in the veil.

1235
01:52:03,466 --> 01:52:07,553
It's the person
standing opposite me now...

1236
01:52:09,055 --> 01:52:10,431
...in the rain.

1237
01:52:10,515 --> 01:52:12,850
Is it still raining?
I hadn't noticed.

1238
01:52:12,934 --> 01:52:17,479
The truth of it is, I've... loved you
from the first second I met you.

1239
01:52:19,482 --> 01:52:25,154
- You're not going away again, are you?
- No. I might drown. But otherwise, no.

1240
01:52:25,238 --> 01:52:27,072
OK... OK.
We'll go in.

1241
01:52:30,910 --> 01:52:33,120
But first let me ask you one thing.

1242
01:52:35,498 --> 01:52:39,168
Do you think...
after we've dried off...

1243
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:43,255
...after we've spent lots more
time together, you might agree...

1244
01:52:45,884 --> 01:52:47,676
...not to marry me?

1245
01:52:48,344 --> 01:52:49,845
And do you think...

1246
01:52:51,306 --> 01:52:55,058
...not being married to me might maybe
be something you could consider...

1247
01:52:56,519 --> 01:52:58,353
...doing for the rest of your life?

1248
01:53:03,943 --> 01:53:05,194
Do you?

1249
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:09,031
I do.
