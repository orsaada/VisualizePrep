I believe in America.

2
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,113
America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,233
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,150
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonour her family.

5
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,238
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,672
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,235
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,831
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,434
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,315
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,957
She resisted, she kept her honour.

12
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,436
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,390
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,196
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,350
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,039
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,594
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,236
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,398
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,476
Sorry.

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,594
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,716
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,596
The judge sentenced them to three years
in prison, but suspended the sentence.

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,238
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

25
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,031
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

26
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,552
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

27
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,437
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,398
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,879
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

30
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,829
What is that?

31
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,394
I want them dead.

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,558
That I cannot do.

33
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,036
I'll give you anything you ask.

34
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,633
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

35
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,799
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

36
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,269
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

37
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,190
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

38
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,915
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

39
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,192
I didn't want to get into trouble.

40
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,436
I understand.

41
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,878
You found paradise in America.

42
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,711
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

43
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,753
You didn't need a friend like me.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,436
But now you come to me and say,

45
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,598
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

46
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,393
But you don't ask with respect.

47
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,549
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

48
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:55,193
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

49
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,789
I ask you for justice.

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,673
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

51
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,559
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

52
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,793
How much shall I pay you?

53
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,074
Bonasera, Bonasera.

54
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,035
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

55
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,629
If you'd come in friendship,

56
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,789
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,757
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

58
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,638
And then they would fear you.

59
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,309

60
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,473

61
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,072
Good.

62
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,799
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

63
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,553
But until that day...

64
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,638
...accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

65
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,513

- Prego.

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,075
He offered him 10,000 dollars
to let Johnny go,

174
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,669
but the bandleader said no.

175
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,193
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

176
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,871
Within an hour,

177
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,712
he signed a release
for a certified cheque of 1,000 dollars.

178
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,919
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

179
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,956
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

180
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,228
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

181
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,911
That's a true story.

182

How are you, Fredo?

189
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,676
My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams.

190
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,069
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

191
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,957
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

192
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,118
Yeah. This is your friend?

193
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,914
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

194
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,790
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

195

But this... man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

- What's his name?
- Woltz.

197
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,832
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

198

- Sure I do.

Good.

217
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,389

grant Mr Woltz?

- Look at this.

- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

you work for Corleone?

Let's get something to eat.

269
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,150
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

270
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,478
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

271
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:17,073
I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything
else. This favour I can't give him.

272
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,955
He never asks a second favour
when he's been refused the first.

273
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:26,109
You don't understand.
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

274
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,755
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

275
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,238
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

276
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,110
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

277
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,269
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

278
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,871
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

279
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,514
Let me be even more frank.

280
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,396
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man, that it's not all dollars and cents.

281
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,990
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

282
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,149
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

283
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,230
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

284
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,908
And she runs off.

285
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,396
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

286
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:25,240
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

287
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,590
You get the hell out of here!

288
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,032
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

289
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,111
Yeah, I heard that story.

290
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,429
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

291
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,108
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

292
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,199
Mr Corleone insists
on hearing bad news immediately.

293
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,235
(HE SCREAMS)

294
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,119
(SCREAMS CONTINUE)

295
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,754
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

296
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,758
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

297
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,030
Now...

298
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:50,040
Sollozzo is known as the Turk. He's
supposed to be very good with a knife,

299
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,639
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

300
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,798
His business is narcotics.

301
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,992
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

302
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,954
In Sicily he has plants
to process them into heroin.

303
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,596
He needs cash, he needs protection
from the police.

304
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,315
He gives them a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.

305
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:18,470
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

306
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,958
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

307
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,628
He's known as a top narcotics man.

308
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,039
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

309
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,953
Tom?

310
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,914
Yes. There's more money
in narcotics than anything else.

311
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,511
If we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.

312
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,952
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

313
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,116
Then they come after us.

314
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:55,111
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

315
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,792
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in ten years' time.

316
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,831
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

317
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,635
Don Corleone.

318
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,151
I need a man who has powerful friends.

319
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,794
I need a million dollars in cash.

320
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,711
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

321
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,714
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30 per cent.

322
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,879
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

323
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,674
And then it would go up.

324
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,316
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

325
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,309
My compliments.

326
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,913
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

327
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,671
So I receive 30 per cent for finance,

328
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,031
political influence and legal protection?

329
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,800
That's right.

330
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,629
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

331
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,789
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

332
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,673
ti saluto, Don Corleone.

333
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,988
I said that I would see you
because I heard you were a serious man,

334
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,395
to be treated with respect.

335
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,270
But, I must say no to you.

336
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,674
And I'll give you my reason.

337
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,759
It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics.

338
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,397
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

339
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,833
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

340
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,431
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

341
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,668
But your business is...
a little dangerous.

342
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,759
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

343
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,919
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

344
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,756
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

345
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,509
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

346
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,669
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

347
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,758
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

348
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,909
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

349
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,231
Santino.

350
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,793
Come here.

351
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:15,633
What's the matter with you? Your brain
is going soft from playing with that girl.

352
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,197
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

353
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,871
Go on.

354
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,718
Tom, what's this nonsense?

355
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,595
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

356
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,118
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

357
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,678
And...

358
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,119
...tell Luca Brasi to come in.

359
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,676
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

360
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,519
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

361
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,160
Go to the Tattaglias.

362
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:04,319
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

363
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,478
and find out what you can.

364

(MUSIC: "HAVE YOURSELF
A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS")

365
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,671
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

366
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,351
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

367
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,519
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

(SONG CONTINUES)

369
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,877
Andiamo, Fredo.

370
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,356
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- OK, Pop.

371
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,519
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

372
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,350
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

373
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,351
Buon Natale, caro. Grazie.

374
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,478
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

375
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,751
Sue bequero Scotch? Pre-war.

376
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,916
Io no bib'.

377
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,397
- You know who I am?
- I know you.

378
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,596
(TRANSLATION) You've been talking
to the Tattaglia family, right?

379
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,396
I think you and I can do business.

380
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,349
I need someone strong like you.

381
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:41,237
I heard that you're not happy
with the Corleone family.

382
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,594
- Want to join me?
- What's in it for me?

383
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,119
50,000 dollars, to start with.

384
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,435
Not bad!

385
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,596
Agreed?

386
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,592
Grazie.

387
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,032
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

388
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,271
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

389
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,189
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

390
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,631
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

391
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,398
Get in.

392
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,708
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- OK, Pop.

393
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,557
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

394
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,993
Fredo...!

395
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,472
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

396
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,394
No.

397
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,912
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

398
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,518
Michael.

399
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,635
No, I wouldn't like you better if you were
Ingrid Bergman. What's the matter?

400
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,634
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

401
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,117
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?

402
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,834
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

403
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,511
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.

404
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,717
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

405
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,118
- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

406
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,836
No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?

407
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,876
Oh, my God.

(LOUD KNOCKING)

409
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,792
Sonny!

410
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,116
Stay back there.

411
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,357
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

412
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,152
There's more news about your old man.

413
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,954
Word is out that he's already dead.

414
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,630
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

415
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,912
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

416
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,554
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

417
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,309
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

418
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,752
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

419
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,555
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

423
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,315
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

424
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,239
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

425
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,671
In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.

426
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,997
Listen to all he has to say
before you do anything.

427
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,591
What's done is done. Don't lose
that famous temper of yours, Sonny.

428
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,870
I'll wait.

429
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,673
Your boss is dead.

430
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,629
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

431
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,868
I want you to help
the Corleones and me.

432
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,991
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

433
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,679
Drink it.

434
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,190
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

435
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,994
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

436
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,949
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

437
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:58,518
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

438
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,117
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

439
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,669
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

440
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,238
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

441
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,036
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

442
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,751
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

443
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:36,835
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

444
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,316
It's good business, Tom.

445
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,514
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

446
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,156
Yeah, well...

447
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,000
Let me worry about Luca.

448
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,711
You just talk to Sonny.

449
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,639
And the other two kids.

450
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,192
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

451
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,633
Now you can go.

452
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,469
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

453
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,318
Blood is a big expense.

454
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,836
He's still alive.

455
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,589
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

456
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,749
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

457
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,790
Your mother is at the hospital with
your father. Looks like he'll pull through.

458
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:56,749
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

459
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,753
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

460
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,793
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

461
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,151
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

462
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,589
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

463
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,395
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

464
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,151
- Hey, do me a favour...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

465
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:26,036
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

466
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:32,236
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

467
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:37,468
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

468
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,992
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed any more.

469
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,838
If your father dies...

470
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,632
...you make the deal.

471
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,356
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

472
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,995
What is it?

473
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,149
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

474
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,511
Tessio, go see what it is.

475
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,230
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

476
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,955
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

477
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,470
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

478
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,240
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

479
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,595
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

480
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,952
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

481
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,312
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

482
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,308
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

483
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,909
Hanging around the house
on the phone would be a big help.

484
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,755
Try Luca again.

485
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,753
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

486
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,589
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

487
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,070
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

488
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,475
Probably late.

489
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,475
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

490
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,997
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

491
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,835
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

492
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:43,273
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

493
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,836
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

494
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,476
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

495
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,511
Watch the kids.

496
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:08,158
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up

the guys will be there a long time.

- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

Exterminate! Watch out,

- Yeah.

- Some girl.

- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?

you love her?

I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

519
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,710
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

534
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,835
I'll ride in the cab.

They interfered with hospital service.

- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

592
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:27,472
What did he say... He wants us
to send Michael to hear the proposition.

593
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,672
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

- We should listen to them.

No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

597
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,792
No more meetings,
discussions, or Sollozzo tricks.

598
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,958
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

599
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,720
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

600
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,480
This is business, not personal!

601
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:58,151
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

602
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,796
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favour.

603
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,437
No more advice on how to
patch things up. Just help me win.

604
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:15,475
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

605
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:19,753
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

606
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:23,635
McCluskey has agreed
to be the Turk's bodyguard.

607
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,310
So when Sollozzo
is being guarded, he's invulnerable.

608
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,956
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

609
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:36,678
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

610
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,509
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

611
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,912
Do me a favour.
Take this into consideration.

612
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,390
All right, we'll wait.

613
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,236
We can't wait. We can't wait.

614
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,954
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

615
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,789
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

616
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,959
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

617
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:16,756
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

618
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,676
They want to have
a meeting with me, right?

619
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:29,590
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

620
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,674
Let's set the meeting.

621
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,079
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

622
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:44,155
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

623
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:48,194
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

624
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,193
They'll search me
when I meet them, right?

625
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,153
So I can't have a weapon on me.

626
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:04,079
But if Clemenza can figure a way
to have a weapon planted there for me...

627
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,079
...then I'll kill them both.

628
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:26,796
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

629
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,390
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

630
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:36,755
This isn't the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

631
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,599
You're taking this very personal.

632
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,997
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

633
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,795
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

634
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,189
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

635
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,234
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

636
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:02,594
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

637
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,279
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

638
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,229
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

639
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,909
It's as cold as they come. Impossible to
trace, so you don't worry about prints.

640
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:26,557
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

641
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,319
Is the trigger too tight?

642
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,274
My ears!

643
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:49,679
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

644
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:52,872
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

645
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:58,228
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

646
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,750
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

647
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,999
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

648
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,919
so walk out fast, but don't run.

649
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,396
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

650
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,751
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

651
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,799
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

652
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,355
and we'll catch the hell.

653
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,109
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

654
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,790
Probably all the other families
will line up against us.

01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,790
These things have to happen every five,
ten years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:47,070
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

658
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,072
You know, Mike, we was all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

659
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,669
Your father too.

660
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,750
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

661
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,753
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

662
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,713
How much time do we have?

663
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:46,869
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

664
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:52,918
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

665
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,831
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

666
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:02,909
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

667
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,430
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

668
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,110
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

669
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,437
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

670

671
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,111
Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.

672
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,312
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

673
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:50,038
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

674
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:54,870
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

675
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:59,870
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

677
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,834
We might be able
to tape the gun behind it.

678
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:14,397
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

679
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:18,275
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

680
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:23,270
Then you go to take a leak. No, better
still, you ask permission to go.

681
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:27,996
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

682
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,829
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

683

I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

684
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:40,558
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

685
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,149
Let's move.

686
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,558
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

687
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,910
Yeah, a million times.

688
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,829
Don't forget. Two shots apiece
in the head as soon as you come out.

689
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:11,279
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

690
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,710
At least a year.

691
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,869
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

692
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,355
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

693
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,270
Take care.

694
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,550
Take care, Mike.

695

I'm glad you came. I hope we can
straighten everything out.

that he won't be, Mike.

699

when we talk.

You can't talk business with him.

702
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,516
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

703
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:47,669
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

704
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:56,269
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

Maybe.

Nice work, Lou.

710
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:42,919
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

711
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,554
I'll have it.

712
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:22,116

- Go ahead.

...is that I have a guarantee.

- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

832
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,159
It was my fault. I hit him.

833
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:44,717
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

to take a look at you.

02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:43,552
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

955
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:47,673
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

956
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:56,757
How did things ever get so far?

957
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:58,916
I don't know.

958
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:04,638
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

959
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:10,555
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

960
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:15,836
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

961
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:19,828
then I'm willing
to let things go on as before.

962
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:24,516
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

963
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:29,635
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

964
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:33,594
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

965
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:36,997
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

966
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,878
He refused to share them.

967
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:44,436
When did I ever
refuse an accommodation?

968
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:47,074
All of you know me.

969
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:52,880
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

970
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:59,872
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

971
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:03,789
It's not like gambling
or liquor or even women,

972
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:09,791
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

973
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,471
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

974
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:18,559
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

975
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:23,550
I believed that then...
and I believe that now.

976
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:25,751
Times have changed.

977
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:30,431
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

978
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:33,279
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

979
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:38,634
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

980
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:43,470
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

981
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:47,516
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

982
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:50,518
After all, we're not communists.

983
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,958
I also don't believe in drugs.

984
02:03:56,160 --> 02:04:00,756
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

985
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:03,918
Somebody says to them
"I have powders.

986
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:10,958
"If you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment,
we can make 50,000 distributing."

987
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:16,712
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

988
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:21,630
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

989
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:24,513
That's an infàmia.

990
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:28,349
In my city we would
keep the traffic to the coloured.

991
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:31,518
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

992
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:41,919
I hoped that we could
come here and reason together.

993
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:49,438
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

994
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:53,952
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

995
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:58,358
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

996
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:01,791
I must have
strict assurance from Corleone.

997
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,310
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger,

998
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,875
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

999
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:13,029
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

1000
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:15,356
You talk about vengeance.

1001
02:05:15,560 --> 02:05:18,518
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

1002
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:21,359
Or my boy to me?

1003
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:24,518
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

1004
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:29,718
But I have selfish reasons.

1005
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:35,119
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country...

1006
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:39,278
...because of this Sollozzo business.

1007
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:44,076
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

1008
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:46,874
Cleared of all these false charges.

1009
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:51,112
But I'm a superstitious man.

1010
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:57,509
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

1011
02:05:57,720 --> 02:06:01,030
or if he should
hang himself in his jail cell,

1012
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:04,994
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

1013
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:09,159
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1014
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:12,799
And that I do not forgive.

1015
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:17,348
But, that aside...

1016
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:22,633
...let me say that I swear...

1017
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:26,798
...on the souls of my grandchildren,

1018
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:31,676
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1019
02:06:55,520 --> 02:07:00,753
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

1020
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:03,679
Mention it. Don't insist.

1021
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:09,755
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

1022
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:16,399
Tattaglia's a pimp. He could never
have outfought Santino.

1023
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:25,430
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1024
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:41,510
Come on, Nancy.

1025
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:45,278
Keep together, everyone.

1026
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:48,556
OK, all right.

1027
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:03,348
How long have you been back?

1028
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:05,516
I've been back a year.

1029
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:09,399
Longer than that, I think.

1030
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:13,515
It's good to see you, Kay.

1031
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:26,878
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1032
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:32,037
He's been sick. Very sick.

1033
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:39,429
But you're not like him. You told me you
weren't going to become like your father.

1034
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:44,798
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1035
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:49,232
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1036
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:51,556
Like a senator or president.

1037
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:54,115
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

1038
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:57,039
They don't have men killed.

1039
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:01,995
Who's being naive, Kay?

1040
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:08,473
My father's way of doing things
is over. Even he knows that.

1041
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:13,629
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1042
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:18,877
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1043
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:23,149
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1044
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:28,511
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1045
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:31,951
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1046
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:36,597
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1047
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:40,432
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

1048
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:45,559
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1049
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:52,559
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that...

1050
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:57,072
...we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1051
02:09:57,280 --> 02:10:00,477
That we have children. Our children.

1052
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:04,313
Kay, I need you.

1053
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:07,675
And I love you.

1054
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:31,715
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1055
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:35,230
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1056
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:38,398
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1057
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:41,512
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1058
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:44,951
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1059
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:49,995
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1060
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:51,792
Don Corleone...

1061
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:56,272
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1062
02:10:56,480 --> 02:11:00,632
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1063
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:03,752
Michael is now head of the family.

1064
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:07,953
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1065
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,116
After we make the move to Nevada

1066
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:14,632
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1067
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:18,799
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1068
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:24,836
Forgive me, but with you gone, me and
Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.

1069
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:30,273
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1070
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:33,313
- Do you have faith in my judgement?
- Yes.

1071
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:36,193
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1072
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:39,676
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1073
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:49,193
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1074
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:52,198
That's all I can tell you now.

1075
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:54,595
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1076
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:58,031
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1077
02:11:58,240 --> 02:12:02,711
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1078
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:06,230
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1079
02:12:06,440 --> 02:12:11,116
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1080
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:32,110
- Thank you, Poppa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1081
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:35,792
Mike... Why am I out?

1082
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:40,795
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

1083
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,594
Things may get rough with the move.

1084
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:46,390
Tom.

1085
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:55,269
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1086
02:12:55,480 --> 02:13:00,634
I thought Santino was
a bad Don, rest in peace.

1087
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:04,753
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1088
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:10,193
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1089
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:13,870
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1090
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:04,799
I can't get over
the way your face looks. So good!

1091
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:09,278
This doctor did some job. Did Kay
talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1092
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:12,711
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1093
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:15,309
Let me open the door, all right?

1094
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:27,112
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1095
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:29,959
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1096
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:36,675
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1097
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:41,718
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1098
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:45,879
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

1099
02:14:46,760 --> 02:14:51,231
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1100
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:54,591
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1101
02:14:59,560 --> 02:15:02,518
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

1102
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:05,678
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1103
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:08,829
Hey, come on! Scram!

1104
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:14,358
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

1105
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:16,551
Sorry.

1106
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:19,354
I don't know. He's tired.

1107
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:28,718
What happened to Moe Greene?

1108
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:33,118
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1109
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:35,550
Well, give him a call.

1110
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:39,557
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1111
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:41,716
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1112
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:45,196
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1113
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:47,994
Well, I owe it all to him.

1114
02:15:48,200 --> 02:15:53,069
He knows how grateful you are. That's
why he'd like to ask a favour of you.

1115
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:55,999
Mike, what can I do?

1116
02:15:56,200 --> 02:16:01,991
We're thinking of giving up our interests
in the olive oil business and settling here.

1117
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:07,832
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it. Tom!

1118
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:12,875
Are you sure? Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1119
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:16,231
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1120
02:16:17,080 --> 02:16:19,230
See, Johnny...

1121
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:23,479
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1122
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:27,639
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1123
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:34,635
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1124
02:16:35,520 --> 02:16:37,795
We're counting on you.

1125
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:43,229
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1126
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:44,839
Good.

1127
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:50,437
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1128
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:52,596
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1129
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:57,749
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1130
02:16:57,960 --> 02:17:01,748
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1131
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:06,792
Is my credit
good enough to buy you out?

1132
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:09,479
Buy me out?

1133
02:17:09,680 --> 02:17:14,879
The casino, the hotel. The
Corleone family wants to buy you out.

1134
02:17:15,480 --> 02:17:20,679
The Corleone family wants
to buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1135
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:23,872
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1136
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:28,517
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1137
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:34,869
You Guineas make me laugh.

1138
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:40,279
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1139
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:44,075
You did that
because we bankrolled your casino

1140
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:49,070
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

1141
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:54,229
Yes. First of all, you're all done. You
don't have that kind of muscle any more.

1142
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:58,592
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1143
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:02,349
Do you think you can come
to my hotel and take over?

1144
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:07,270
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1145
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:10,711
Is that why you slapped
my brother around in public?

1146
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:15,471
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1147
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:19,639
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1148
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:24,152
I have a business to run.
I got to kick asses sometimes.

1149
02:18:24,360 --> 02:18:28,069
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

1150
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:30,714
You straightened my brother out?

1151
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:35,198
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1152
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:37,675
What's wrong with you?

1153
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:45,395
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1154
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:47,033
Son-of-a-bitch!

1155
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:52,360
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1156
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:55,757
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

1157
02:18:55,960 --> 02:18:59,316
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

1158
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:04,355
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1159
02:19:04,560 --> 02:19:08,155
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1160
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:16,440
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1161
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:19,916
Fredo...

1162
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:23,078
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1163
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:28,517
But don't ever take sides
with anyone against the family again.

1164
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:42,717
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

1165
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:49,040
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1166
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:58,478
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1167
02:19:58,680 --> 02:20:00,750
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1168
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:03,520
They want you
to be godfather to their boy.

1169
02:20:03,720 --> 02:20:05,676
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1170
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:08,235
Let me think about it. Come on.

1171
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:18,998
Barzini will move against you first.

1172
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:23,398
He'll set up a meeting
with someone you absolutely trust.

1173
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:26,433
Guaranteeing your safety.

1174
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:29,996
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1175
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:37,390
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1176
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:42,028
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1177
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:48,795
I don't know.

1178
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:53,275
Are you happy
with your wife and children?

1179
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:56,836
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1180
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:02,710
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1181
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:06,276
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1182
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:10,191
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

1183
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:15,228
Women and children
can be careless, but not men.

1184
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:20,150
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1185
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:23,193
He looks more like you every day.

1186
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:29,912
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1187
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:34,030
Read the funny papers.

1188
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:46,072
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in- and out-going calls.

1189
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:52,037
- I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

1190
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,760
What's the matter?

1191
02:21:57,960 --> 02:22:00,315
What's bothering you?

1192
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:07,631
I'll handle it. I told you
I can handle it, I'll handle it.

1193
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:24,239
I knew that Santino
would have to go through all this.

1194
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:27,318
And Fredo...

1195
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:31,030
Fredo was, well...

1196
02:22:32,480 --> 02:22:35,916
But I never wanted this for you.

1197
02:22:37,360 --> 02:22:42,229
I worked my whole life. I don't apologise
for taking care of my family.

1198
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:46,149
And I refused to be a fool,

1199

dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1200
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:56,039
I don't apologise. That's my life,
but I thought that...

1201
02:22:56,960 --> 02:23:02,193
...that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1202
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:09,039

Well...

1205
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:20,599
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1206
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:24,475
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

1207
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:32,912
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

1208
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:36,396
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

1209
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:54,469
Can I hold it, please?

1210
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:12,349
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1212
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:20,197

That's it. We'll put it right there.

1216
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:44,671
I'll show you something. Come here.

1217
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:47,836
Stand there.

1218
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:53,509
Give me an orange!

1219

1224
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:34,795
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1225
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:38,788
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1226
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,992
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1227
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:46,591
I can arrange security. On my territory.

1228
02:28:48,880 --> 02:28:51,872
- All right?
- All right.

1229
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:11,158
Do you know
how they're going to come at you?

1230
02:29:13,360 --> 02:29:17,672
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:21,030
Where I'll be safe.

1232
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:35,949
I always thought
it would be Clemenza, not Tessio.

1233
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:40,472
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1234
02:29:42,280 --> 02:29:44,271
But I'm going to wait.

1235
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:46,675

I've decided
to be godfather to Connie's baby.

1237
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,912
And then I'll meet with Don Barzini

1238

02:42:11,160 --> 02:42:15,950
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1316
02:42:16,160 --> 02:42:19,948
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1317
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:23,118
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1318
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:29,077
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1319
02:42:29,280 --> 02:42:30,918
Connie.

1320
02:42:32,480 --> 02:42:37,793
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the
mall? He knew he was going to kill him.

1321
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:43,279
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

1322
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:47,393
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1323
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:50,910
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1324
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:02,875
No! No, no...

1325
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:06,595
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

1326
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:28,591
She's hysterical.

1327
02:43:32,880 --> 02:43:34,757
Hysterical.

1328
02:43:36,480 --> 02:43:39,040
Michael, is it true?

1329
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:43,390
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1330
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:47,149
Don't ask me
about my business. Enough!

1331
02:44:05,400 --> 02:44:07,118
All right.

1332
02:44:09,560 --> 02:44:11,516
This one time.

1333
02:44:15,080 --> 02:44:19,039
This one time I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

1334
02:44:24,040 --> 02:44:26,759
Is it true?

1335
02:44:29,480 --> 02:44:31,232
Is it?

1336
02:44:32,680 --> 02:44:34,113
No.

1337
02:44:47,240 --> 02:44:50,391
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

1338
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:22,229
Don Corleone.
